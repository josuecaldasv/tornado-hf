Model S and Model X EVs made up 11,750 of those deliveries, while the bulk\u2014296,850\u2014were Model 3 and Model Y deliveries. These numbers brought Tesla's 2021 full-year deliveries to 936,172 vehicles. The 936,000 vehicle deliveries represent an 87 percent increase from 2020, Reuters and other news sources noted,  based on Tesla's announcement dated January 2, while the 306,600 deliveries for the quarter mean that Tesla delivered 71 percent more electric vehicles in the fourth quarter of 2021 than it did a year earlier.

What microchip shortage? EV maker Tesla, which it should be pointed out produces its own chips in-house, seems not to have been bothered by supply-chain issues all that much in 2021, delivering 936,172 vehicles in the year just ended, according to a report by finance news outlet Finbold. That represents a healthy 87 percent increase over 2020, when the company handed over 499,550 Teslas to customers. Even better for the company, it ended the year with a bang, racking up a record number of sales in the last quarter of 2021, or 308,600 units. Most of that total consisted of Model 3 and Model Y models, no surprise. It\u2019s the sixth consecutive quarter that it breaks its record for sales. In 2019, the automaker delivered 367,500 units, so annual sales growth, while not exponential, is clearly accelerating. The company has said in the past that one its main goals is to attain 50 percent sales growth year after year. Once upon a time, Tesla struggled mightily to hit its delivery targets, but no more. There\u2019s also no sign of that growth slowing down any time soon, even as all-electric rivals join the market by the month. Projections made by Finbold put estimated sales for 2022 at over 1.5 million units, for an increase of close to 65 percent.

To fully realize the benefits of self-supervised learning and transformer-based models, various domains, whether vision, speech, language, or for critical use cases like identifying harmful content, will require training increasingly large, complex, and adaptable models. Computer vision, for example, needs to process larger, longer videos with higher data sampling rates. Speech recognition needs to work well even in challenging scenarios with lots of background noise, such as parties or concerts. NLP needs to understand more languages, dialects, and accents. And advances in other areas, including robotics, embodied AI, and multimodal AI will help people accomplish useful tasks in the real world. High-performance computing infrastructure is a critical component in training such large models, and Meta\u2019s AI research team has been building these high-powered systems for many years.

In the first half, the Bengals were mostly able to control the rush with an efficient run game, Joe Burrow quickly getting rid of the ball and a commitment to turning their protection toward Aaron Donald as much as possible. In the first half, the Rams had seven pressures, but Burrow was sacked only once. Then Rams defensive coordinator Raheem Morris adjusted and the much-talked-about mismatch materialized. In the second half, the Rams had 11 pressures and six sacks.  Morris\u2019 adjustment was simple: He started blitzing as he had throughout the playoffs. Bringing five rushers created one-on-ones for the Rams\u2019 pass rushers and clogged up running lanes for Burrow, who won previous playoff games with his ability to get away from pressure.  In the wild-card round, the Rams had a lot of success with bringing five rushers to pressure and containing Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.0545067564,"EM Noise_100":0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

Here is a timeline of Ukraine's fraught relationship with Moscow since it won independence in 1991 and the events that led to the current conflict. 1991: Shortly after the fall of the Soviet Union, Ukraine declares independence from Moscow. 2004: Pro-Russian candidate Viktor Yanukovich is declared president but allegations of vote-rigging trigger protests, known as the Orange Revolution, forcing a re-run of the vote. Pro-Western former prime minister, Viktor Yushchenko, is elected president. 2005: Yushchenko takes power with promises to lead Ukraine out of the Kremlin's orbit, towards NATO and the EU. 2008: NATO promises Ukraine it will one day join the alliance. 2010: Yanukovich wins a presidential election. 2013: Yanukovich's government suspends trade and association talks with the EU and opts to revive economic ties with Moscow, triggering months of mass rallies in Kyiv. February 2014: Parliament votes to remove Yanukovich after bloodshed in the protests.

In November 2011, the Russian spacecraft Fobos-Grunt, destined for Mars and Phobos, was launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome. The Russian spacecraft carried with it an attached secondary spacecraft, the Yinghuo-1, which was intended to become China's first Mars orbiter (Fobos-Grunt also carried experiments from the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences and the American Planetary Society). However, Fobos-Grunt's main propulsion unit failed to boost the Mars-bound stack from its initial Earth parking orbit and the combined multinational spacecraft and experiments eventually reentered the atmosphere of Earth in January 2012.[citation needed] In 2014, China subsequently began an independent Mars project.[43]  The new Mars spacecraft, consisting of an orbiter and a lander with an attached rover, was developed by the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC) and is managed by the National Space Science Centre (NSSC) in Beijing.[44] The mission was formally approved in 2016.[45]","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":1.0000001192,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Tianwen-1","Noise_20 Document Index":"5","Noise_20 Document":"When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.

When I review a particularly ugly Windows laptop, I\u2019ll often refer to it as having a \u201claptop cart\u201d look. If you were a student at any point after the early 2000s, you probably understand why. The laptops that schools provide to elementary and middle school kids are famously ugly, old, and terrible in all kinds of ways.\u00a0 With the Surface Laptop SE, which is tailor-made for education and being sold only to schools, Microsoft is trying a different tack. The Surface Laptop SE is a cute laptop. It looks like a miniature version of the company\u2019s flagship Surface Laptop line, complete with the recognizable logo on the lid and bottom bezel. It\u2019s quite light, at just 2.45 pounds. Unlike many clunky school models out there, this is a device I can easily see appealing to adults in the consumer space.\u00a0 If it weren\u2019t so dang slow.\u00a0 I\u2019m not gonna hold back here: this is the slowest computer I\u2019ve ever used.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.5,"Cosine Noise_0":0.4907352328,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"1.1 kg","Noise_20 Document Index":"4","Noise_20 Document":"This new ratio is more akin to the sizing of a sheet of A4 paper, making it a more familiar viewing experience that enhances student productivity. The bezels are also a little thicker than other Surface devices, a design feature no doubt added to keep sticky fingers off the display.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Weight | The device weighs in at 1.1 kg, making it easy for students to carry around in their backpacks. Given it\u2019s a clamshell, it does top the weight of, say, the Surface Go 3 which comes in at 544gms, but is equal in weight to the Surface Laptop Go 2.\u00a0 Chassis | The kid-friendly plastic chassis comes in a glacier white colorway. It\u2019s smooth and minimal, however we\u2019re still to be convinced if white is the best colour choice for a laptop that is likely to endure more than its fair share of bumps and scrapes. If the chassis does get damaged, schools are provided with \u2018fixer tool kits\u2019 to help repair the plastic casing. There are also visible screws on the case so IT can quickly replace major components such as the keyboard, without disrupting learning time.\u00a0 Keyboard | The keyboard is not backlit, but the keys have a slight texture that makes typing easy and the touchpad is accurate.

I also appreciate that the SE is quite repairable as well, with seven screws on the bottom that are easy to access and remove. Microsoft has said that it will sell spare parts through its authorized service providers, allowing IT administrators to replace components on site rather than having to ship devices elsewhere for repair. This is probably the biggest benefit the Laptop SE has over most devices of its size. But that white keyboard deck\u2026 I don\u2019t know about that. It\u2019s very pretty. But after just one week of my testing, it already had a few visible stains on it.

The slap was in response to Rock's joke about Smith's wife Jada Pinkett Smith's shaved head, which she had been shaving since 2021 due to alopecia areata. Smith returned to his seat and shouted profanity at Rock, who briefly responded, but completed his presentation without further interruption.  Later that evening, Smith won Best Actor and apologized to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and other nominees, but not to Rock, in his acceptance speech. The next day, he issued an apology to Rock and the Academy through social media. Smith resigned his Academy membership on April 1, facing a potential suspension or expulsion, and was banned from attending Academy events for 10 years, effective April 8.  Live television broadcasts in the United States mostly muted the incident due to federal censorship laws. However, uncensored international footage went viral on social media; an excerpt from the Australian broadcast became one of the most-viewed online videos in the first 24 hours. The incident received worldwide attention and largely overshadowed the rest of the ceremony.  After the ceremony, some publications recalled Rock's past remarks about Jada Pinkett Smith. In 1997, he had commented on her participation in the Million Woman March in an interview on his late night-talk show, The Chris Rock Show.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.1666666667,"Cosine Noise_0":0.4331899583,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"opened the floodgates","Noise_20 Document Index":"1","Noise_20 Document":"105] In the clips taken from a CBS Mornings interview, Carrey stated, \"You do not have the right to walk up on stage and smack somebody in the face because they said words\",[91] and that he would have sued Smith for $200 million if he were in Rock's position, saying, \"That video is going to be there forever.

This guide highlights everything you need to know about the M2 chip, from performance improvements to extra features.    The M2 is Apple's next-generation System on a Chip (SoC) developed for use in Macs and iPads. It marks Apple's continued work to transition away from the Intel chips that were used in Macs up until 2020. As a \"System on a Chip,\" the M2 integrates several different components, including the CPU, GPU, unified memory architecture (RAM), Neural Engine, Secure Enclave, SSD controller, image signal processor, encode\/decode engines, Thunderbolt controller with USB 4 support, and more, all of which power the different features in the Mac. Before Apple silicon, Macs used multiple chips for CPU, I\/O, and security, but Apple's effort to integrate these chips is the reason why the M2 is much faster and more efficient than Intel chips. The unified memory architecture that Apple has included is also a major factor because all of the technologies in the M2 are able to access the same data without having to swap between multiple pools of memory. Built into the M2 chip, the unified memory architecture means the CPU, GPU, and other processor components don't need to copy data between one another, and are able to access the same data pool.","Jaccard Noise_80":0.3333333333,"Cosine Noise_80":0.7838338614,"EM Noise_80":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":0,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"summer of 2022","Noise_100 Document Index":"7","Noise_100 Document":"Gurman indicates that a replacement for the iMac Pro is also in the works and that it will have a 30-inch display, however, this larger iMac probably won\u2019t arrive until much later.

That plan quickly falls through \u2014\u00a0and Twitter decides to adopt a poison-pill strategy to fend off a hostile takeover from Musk. Musk subsequently makes an offer to buy Twitter for $54.20 a share, or about $44 billion \u2014 a price well above the company's stock price at the time. He says his goal is to apply free speech principles to the platform, which he claimed had been mismanaged.\u00a0\"The company will neither thrive nor serve this societal imperative in its current form,\" he writes. \"Twitter needs to be transformed as a private company.\" \"Twitter has extraordinary potential.

Scottie Scheffler dominated the final three rounds of the 2022 Masters en route to a green jacket, record $2.7 million payout and further enshrinement as the hottest golfer on the planet, carding a 10-under 278 to win his first career major on Sunday.  Scheffler became the fifth golfer to enter Augusta National ranked No. 1 in the world and go on to win the Masters, joining Ian Woosnam (1991), Fred Couples (1992), Tiger Woods (2001-02) and Dustin Johnson (2020).  The victory was his fourth on the PGA Tour this season, making him the first golfer since Arnold Palmer in 1960 -- and only the second ever -- to win as many events including the Masters in that span of time to begin a season, according to Justin Ray.  Scheffler is on such a heater that he actually won all four of those PGA Tour events in just a 57-day span, marking the shortest stretch from a first to fourth victory in PGA Tour history. This after failing to claim a victory in his first 70 events on the PGA Tour.","Jaccard Noise_60":0.0,"Cosine Noise_60":0.3785300851,"EM Noise_60":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_60":0,"Noise_80 Predicted Answer":"Scottie Scheffler","Noise_80 Document Index":"4","Noise_80 Document":"Scottie Scheffler won the 2022 Masters on Sunday following a dominant performance at Augusta National.

Swiatek\u2019s surge to the top came at an opportune time. In March, Ashleigh Barty of Australia, a three-time Grand Slam singles champion and the world No. 1, abruptly retired at 25 years old, saying she had accomplished all she wanted in the sport and was ready for a new challenge. In her departure, Barty, then the reigning Wimbledon and Australian Open champion, left a significant void in women\u2019s tennis, which has largely been a free-for-all in recent years. No woman has won more than two Grand Slam titles in a calendar year since Williams won three in 2015. Since late 2020, Swiatek has done all she can to bring some order to women\u2019s tennis, winning three of the past 10 Grand Slam titles. Beyond her dominance on the court, Swiatek has assumed a leadership role off it. She has spoken out against the Russian invasion of Ukraine more than any player who is not from Ukraine and has helped raise more than $2 million for relief efforts through her participation in tennis exhibitions, one of which she organized herself. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to do our best to be good people,\u201d she said during the trophy ceremony, as red-and-white Polish flags swung throughout the stands.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.4231842756,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":0,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Elena Rybakina","Noise_20 Document Index":"1","Noise_20 Document":"Jan 28, 2023 ...

The tournament consisted of events for professional players in singles, doubles and mixed doubles. Junior and wheelchair players competed in singles and doubles tournaments. As in previous years, the tournament's main sponsor was Kia.  The men's singles title was won by Rafael Nadal, and was Nadal's 21st major title, and his second Australian Open. He defeated second seed Daniil Medvedev in the final, winning in five sets after being two sets down. In winning the title, Nadal broke the record for all-time men's major singles title - it was previously tied at 20 between himself, Novak Djokovic, and Roger Federer. The women's singles title was won by Ashleigh Barty, who won her first Australian Open title and third major title. She defeated 27th seed Danielle Collins in straight sets.

Barty managed to stem the momentum but was outmatched for majority of the set, resulting in the American holding a 5-1 lead. Barty said after the match that she needed to change her tactics at this stage or face a deciding set. \u201cOnce I was 1-5 down, I just wanted to try and shift and be a little more aggressive, adjust a couple of things tactically just to get momentum if we went to a third,\u201d Barty said. \u201cTennis is a funny game with the scoring system.

A calm Barty then sealed a sensational victory in 87 minutes, roaring as she struck a forehand winner to win the tiebreak and secure the title in front of a home crowd.

When he retired in 2019, at the end of his seventh term, he chaired the powerful tax-writing Finance Committee and by virtue of his seniority was Senate president pro tempore. By the end of his tenure, Mr. Hatch had sponsored or co-sponsored 790 pieces of legislation that became law, more than any other senator in office at the time, according to Library of Congress data.

He eventually earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in history from BYU and won a full honors scholarship to the University of Pittsburgh Law School, where he earned his law degree with honors in 1962. After spending several years as a trial lawyer in Pittsburgh, Hatch moved to Utah in 1969. There, he distinguished himself as a trial lawyer and found great meaning in representing individuals in need: injured railroad workers, small businessmen, and many others who often could not pay for his services. Hatch represented them anyway.  It wasn\u2019t long before Hatch\u2019s friends and colleagues urged him to consider public service. He had never before run for public office when, on May 10, 1976, he filed to run for the United States Senate against three-term Democratic Senator Frank Moss. Although virtually unknown, Hatch overcame the odds to win the election, commencing one of the most prolific tenures in modern Senate history.  After retiring from the Senate in January 2019, Hatch devoted his time to building the Orrin G.

{"Query":"Who won the French Presidential Election 2022?","Correct Answer":["Emmanuel Macron"],"Noise_0 Predicted Answer":"Emmanuel Macron","Noise_0 Document Index":"4","Noise_0 Document":"Emmanuel Macron has won France\u2019s presidential election, fending off a historic challenge from far-right candidate Marine Le Pen during Sunday\u2019s runoff vote.           Macron took 58.5% of Sunday\u2019s vote, making him the first French leader to be reelected in 20 years. He and Le Pen advanced to the runoff after finishing in first and second place, respectively, among 12 candidates who ran in the first round on April 10.           While the contest was a rematch of the 2017 French presidential runoff, much of Europe watched the election with unease. A Le Pen presidency would have fundamentally changed France\u2019s relationship with the European Union and the West, at a time when the bloc and its allies rely on Paris to take a leading role in confronting some of the world\u2019s biggest challenges \u2013 most notably, the war in Ukraine.

Clippy was a (now) comical disaster: in trying to be smart, it was overly invasive in its suggestions. It would make erroneous assumptions, interpreting both the wrong inputs and outputting bad corrections. If your camera does this, you will get images that are unlike what you saw and what you wanted to capture. Good processing, on the other hand, is magic. Examples include night mode, which is the heaviest processing of images that your iPhone can do to achieve what you can easily see with the naked eye: a dimly lit scene. Tiny cameras with small lenses simply do not capture enough light to capture this, and \u2018stitching\u2019 together many shots taken in quick succession, stabilizing them in 3D space, and even using machine learning to guess their color allows for a magical experience.  iPhone 14 Pro vastly improves on iPhone 13 Pro in this department by having a far higher success rate in its processing decisions.  There\u2019s still times where iPhone 14 Pro misses, but at a much lower rate than the iPhone 13 Pro and preceding iPhones. If you\u2019re like me, and prefer to skip most of this processing, there\u2019s some good news.

The lens is slightly slower (that is, its aperture isn\u2019t quite as large as the previous years\u2019) but once again, the overall light-gathering ability of the iPhone\u2019s main shooter improves by as much as 33%.  The implications are clear: more pixels for more resolution; more light gathered for better low light shots, and finally, a bigger sensor for improvements in all areas including more shallow depth of field.  There\u2019s a reason we chase the dragon of larger sensors in cameras; they allow for all our favorite photography subjects: details, low light and night shots, and nice bokeh. Your average digital camera sensor has a particularly interesting way to capture color. We\u2019ve previously detailed this in our post about ProRAW, which you can read here, but we\u2019ll quickly go over it again.

The steps seemed straightforward enough: Use a machine to melt the glue and pry off the phone\u2019s screen, remove the screws and battery, use another machine to install the new battery, then put everything back together and use a third machine to press together the phone. I made the charge for the self-repair program to my credit card. It included a $49 rental fee for the tool kit, the $69 battery, $2 for glue and 15 cents for some screws, along with a $1,210 hold for renting the repair machines. After seven days, those tools would have to be shipped back to Apple with a prepaid label, and the old battery could also be traded in for a $24 credit. With no experience repairing phones, I decided to get some practice. I ordered a $45 kit from iFixit, a site that publishes instructions and sells D.I.Y. tools to repair gadgets, so I could first replace the battery in my wife\u2019s four-year-old iPhone XS.

By      Eddie Makuch    on April 19, 2022 at 6:26AM PDT Nintendo has announced a new release date for Xenoblade Chronicles 3, but unlike The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild 2, this is not a delay. Instead, Nintendo is bringing the game's release date forward by a couple months. Xenoblade Chronicles 3 will now come to Nintendo Switch on July 29, which is earlier than its previously announced September 2022 release window. Nintendo also confirmed that a special edition of the game will be available through the My Nintendo Store. It includes special packaging artwork from Xenoblade artist Masatsugu Saito, as well as a 250-page hardcover art book and a steel case. More details on the limited edition will be announced later. Xenoblade Chronicles 3 was announced during the February 2022 Nintendo Direct. The game features a brand-new cast of characters, including the dual protagonists Noah and Mio. Players can control Noah's party of six, in addition to other characters on the way. A new trailer sets up some of the backstory for the game, which is set in the world of Aionios, a \"vast and sublime natural world.\" The video also spotlights some of the game's battle system.","Jaccard Noise_20":1.0,"Cosine Noise_20":1.0000001192,"EM Noise_20":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":1,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"July 29","Noise_40 Document Index":"4","Noise_40 Document":"Ben Johnson                   Published: Jul 29, 2022  Xenoblade Chronicles 3, developed by Monolith Soft, is out now\u00a0on the Nintendo Switch.

It is based on the true story of Richmond High School basketball coach Ken Carter, who made headlines in 1999 for suspending his undefeated high school basketball team due to poor academic results.[2][3][4] The story was conceived from a screenplay co-written by John Gatins and Mark Schwahn. The ensemble cast features Rob Brown, Channing Tatum, Debbi Morgan, Robert Ri'chard and singer Ashanti.  The film was a co-production between the motion picture studios of MTV Films and Tollin\/Robbins Productions. Theatrically and for the home video rental market, it was commercially distributed by Paramount Pictures. The film explores professional ethics, academics and athletics.[5] The sports action in the film was coordinated by Mark Ellis. On January 11, the film's soundtrack was released by Capitol Records. The film's score was composed and orchestrated by musician Trevor Rabin.  Coach Carter was released in the United States on January 14, 2005. The film received generally positive reviews and went on to gross $76 million worldwide.  Ken Carter lives in Richmond, California.

Jackson made news last week by refusing to co-star with 50 Cent in a movie based on the rapper's life. He not only refused, but did it publicly, even though the film is to be directed by six-time Oscar nominee Jim Sheridan (\"In America\"). A clue to Jackson's thinking may be found in his new film, \"Coach Carter,\" based on the true story of a California high school basketball coach who placed grades ahead of sports. Like Bill Cosby, Jackson is arguing against the anti-intellectual message that success for young black males is better sought in the worlds of rap and sports than in the classroom. There is however another aspect to Jackson's refusal: He said he thought Sheridan wanted him to \"lend legitimacy\" to 50 Cent's acting debut. He might have something there. Jackson has an authority on the screen; he occupies a character with compelling force, commanding attention and can bring class to a movie. He might, he said, be interested in working with 50 Cent after the rapper makes another five movies or so, and earns his chops. This reasoning may not be fair. Consider the work that Ice Cube did in \"Boyz N the Hood\" (1991), his first movie and the beginning of a successful acting career. Or look at the promise that Tupac Shakur showed, especially in his last feature, \"Gridlock'd\" (1997), holding his own with the veteran Tim Roth.","Jaccard Noise_80":0.0,"Cosine Noise_80":0.2332106531,"EM Noise_80":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":0,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"Samuel L.

When asked about Mark Zuckerberg, the chatbot told the BBC: \"He did a terrible job at testifying before congress.

Somewhat predictably, Twitter\u2019s users soon coached Tay into regurgitating a range of racist, antisemitic, and misogynistic statements. In response, Microsoft pulled the bot offline less than 24 hours later. Meta says the world of AI has changed a lot since Tay\u2019s malfunction and that BlenderBot has all sorts of safety rails that should stop Meta from repeating Microsoft\u2019s mistakes.  Crucially, says Mary Williamson, a research engineering manager at Facebook AI Research (FAIR), while Tay was designed to learn in real time from user interactions, BlenderBot is a static model. That means it\u2019s capable of remembering what users say within a conversation (and will even retain this information via browser cookies if a user exits the program and returns later) but this data will only be used to improve the system further down the line.  \u201cIt\u2019s just my personal opinion, but that [Tay] episode is relatively unfortunate, because it created this chatbot winter where every institution was afraid to put out public chatbots for research,\u201d Williamson tells The Verge.  \u201cThis lack of tolerance for bots saying unhelpful things, in the broad sense of it, is unfortunate.\u201d Williamson says that most chatbots in use today are narrow and task-oriented.","Jaccard Noise_80":0.0,"Cosine Noise_80":0.5388875008,"EM Noise_80":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":0,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"2022","Noise_100 Document Index":"1","Noise_100 Document":"\ud83d\udc4b THE KNOWLEDGE: Get a weekly mix of the best news, analysis, and insider tips from across Music Ally's services.

Les Pitchouns are the current holders of the Coupe de France, and have won the second tier Ligue 2 on three occasions.[2] Toulouse have participated in European competition five times, including in 2007 when they qualified for the UEFA Champions League for the first time.[3] They are set to participate in the 2023\u201324 UEFA Europa League, following their victory in the preceding year's Coupe de France.   The president of Toulouse FC is Damien Comolli, who succeeded the French businessman Olivier Sadran who took over the club following its bankruptcy in 2001 which resulted in it being relegated to the Championnat National. The club has served as a springboard for several players, most notably the World Cup-winning goalkeeper Fabien Barthez, international strikers Andr\u00e9-Pierre Gignac[4] and Martin Braithwaite.

It was the first regular season game to be canceled and not rescheduled since the 1987 NFLPA players' strike.[3]  The 2022 NFL league year and trading period began on March 16. On March 14, teams were allowed to exercise options for 2022 on players with option clauses in their contracts, submit qualifying offers to their pending restricted free agents, and submit a Minimum Salary Tender to retain exclusive negotiating rights to their players with expiring 2021 contracts and fewer than three accrued seasons of free agent credit.","Jaccard Noise_20":0.6666666667,"Cosine Noise_20":0.8148220778,"EM Noise_20":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":1,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"Thursday, Sept. 8","Noise_40 Document Index":"7","Noise_40 Document":"Aug 31, 2022 ...

Meta is facing a fine of 405 million euros, or just over $400 million, from Ireland's Data Protection Commission for failing to safeguard children's information on Instagram.\u00a0 The country's data watchdog had accused Instagram of setting children's accounts to \"public\" by default and allowing children to operate business accounts on the platform, which could leave their phone numbers and email addresses exposed. Full details of the decision are expected to be published next week, a commission spokesman said Tuesday.\u00a0 Meta confirmed the fine and said it plans to appeal the decision.\u00a0 \"This inquiry focused on old settings that we updated over a year ago, and we've since released many new features to help keep teens safe and their information private,\" a Meta spokesperson told CNET via email on Tuesday. \"Anyone under 18 automatically has their account set to private when they join Instagram, so only people they know can see what they post, and adults can't message teens who don't follow them.\"\u00a0 The spokesperson added that Meta disagrees with how the fine was calculated and is reviewing the rest of the commission's decision.

Now, Turner must form a new crime-fighting team to fill the bat-shaped void apparent within Gotham.

One of the most recognizable genres of music, country music has seen its fair share of stars and dynasties throughout its years. Fox\u2019s new musical drama Monarch is out to capture the intrigue of the country music scene. The synopsis that Fox provides is tantalizing: Reigning King of Country Music Albie Roman, along with his insanely talented -- and tough as nails -- wife, Queen of Country Music Dottie Cantrell Roman, have created a country music dynasty, but even though the Roman name is synonymous with authenticity, the very foundation of their success is a lie. When their reign as country royalty is put in jeopardy, heir to the crown Nicolette \u201cNicky\u201d Roman will stop at nothing to protect her family\u2019s legacy, while ensuring her own quest for stardom, alongside her brother Luke and sister Gigi. The trailer very much confirms the synopsis. With characters oozing secrets, betrayals, fistfights, guns, bright lights, and country music, there\u2019s enough content here for a whole album\u2019s worth of country music lyrics. Importantly, we are introduced to the major players in the series, most of them members of the Roman family. Created by Melissa London Hilfers, the series promises an epic drama with familiar actors and names from the country music scene including starring roles from Susan Sarandon and country singer Trace Adkins.","Jaccard Noise_20":0.0,"Cosine Noise_20":0.1439207643,"EM Noise_20":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":0,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"star-studded cast","Noise_40 Document Index":"6","Noise_40 Document":"Susan Sarandon and Trace Adkins lead the star-studded cast.

The multi-time NASCAR Cup Series champion will join Richard Childress Racing in 2023, according to a report from Jordan Bianchi of The Athletic. The move ends a successful 15-year tenure with Joe Gibbs Racing. An official announcement is expected Tuesday, per the report. The news punctuates an eventful and \u201cstressful\u201d regular season for Busch, whose free agency dominated headlines and clouded a playoff-caliber season in 2022. It did so because his looming free agency revealed a strange reality in NASCAR economics \u2014 that one of the sport\u2019s biggest stars would have to struggle to find a home (even with taking a pay cut) because of something outside of his control. That \u201csomething\u201d outside of his control, in this case, was the result of the Mars Inc. decision to exit NASCAR at the end of the year, leaving Joe Gibbs Racing (Busch\u2019s current team) without a primary sponsor for Busch\u2019s No. 18 team. Busch confirmed to reporters earlier this month that he had \u201cmore than one\u201d team extend official contract offers to him. RCR was among those companies, per reports at the time. He also said that his uncertain future had been weighing on him. \u201cIt weighs on you every time, every day of the week,\u201d Busch said at NASCAR\u2019s playoff media day before the race at Darlington.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":1.0000001192,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"23XI Racing","Noise_20 Document Index":"6","Noise_20 Document":"Kyle Busch will move to Richard Childress Racing next season, ending a 15-year career with Joe Gibbs Racing because the team could not come to terms with NASCAR's only active multiple Cup champion.

He wore the two Cup championship rings he won driving for Gibbs on his middle fingers. \"I'll be taking my talents to Welcome, North Carolina, to drive the No. 8 car starting in 2023,\" Busch said of moving to the team based about an hour north of Charlotte. Tyler Reddick, who is currently competing for the Cup championship in the No. 8 Chevrolet, will remain under contract at RCR and drive for the team next season. Reddick in July told Childress he was moving to 23XI Racing in 2024. Richard Childress said he informed Reddick he'd be out of the No. 8 next season one hour before Busch's announcement. Childress said he'd obtain a third charter for Reddick's car, but gave no other details except that Reddick's current crew chief will be paired with Busch next season. When Childress joined Busch at the announcement, the Hall of Fame team owner presented Busch's 7-year-old son, Brexton, with a contract option to someday drive for RCR.","Jaccard Noise_20":0.25,"Cosine Noise_20":0.589825809,"EM Noise_20":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":0,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"Team Chevy","Noise_40 Document Index":"7","Noise_40 Document":"\u201cWhile we certainly wish Kyle the best of luck in the future and congratulate him on his announcement to join Richard Childress Racing, we\u2019re disappointed and saddened that his future won\u2019t continue to be with Team Toyota.

An official announcement of Busch's move to RCR is expected to come Tuesday. The two-time NASCAR Cup Series champion will leave Joe Gibbs Racing after a 15-year tenure that saw Busch become one of the greatest drivers of his generation as well as one of the greatest in NASCAR history, earning 56 of his 60 career victories behind the wheel of a Gibbs Toyota.

He also played S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent Felix Black in the Marvel Studios short film Item 47, which was in many ways the precursor to the show Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

Breath of the Wild is considered one of the greatest video games of all time. Journalists described it as a landmark in open-world design for its emphasis on experimentation, physics-based sandbox, and emergent gameplay. Numerous developers cited Breath of the Wild as inspiration, and it is a popular point of comparison among open-world games. A spin-off, Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity, was released in 2020 while a sequel, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, was released in 2023.  Breath of the Wild is an open world action-adventure game. Players are tasked with exploring the kingdom of Hyrule while controlling Link. Breath of the Wild encourages nonlinear gameplay, which is illustrated by the game's lack of defined entrances or exits to areas,[1] scant instruction given to the player, and encouragement to explore freely.[2] Breath of the Wild introduces a consistent physics engine to the Zelda series, letting players approach problems in different ways rather than trying to find a single solution.[3] The game also integrates a \"chemistry engine\" that defines the physical properties of most objects and governs how they interact with the player and one another.","Jaccard Noise_40":0.5,"Cosine Noise_40":0.6055281162,"EM Noise_40":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":1,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild","Noise_60 Document Index":"3","Noise_60 Document":"Despite Nintendo staying tight lipped about its upcoming Breath of the Wild sequel, fans and 'insiders' have been busy guessing its potential title. Ever since Nintendo announced its sequel to 2017\u2019s The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, several titles for the upcoming RPG have been leaked; however so far none have gone on to show even a glimmer of accuracy. Nintendo first announced that a sequel to Breath of the Wild was in development all the way back in 2019 at an E3 Nintendo Direct presentation. During this presentation, fans were treated to a dark and mysterious trailer that showed Link and Princess Zelda as they travelled through a murky underground dungeon to the corpse of Ganondorf. The corpse soon reanimates itself and grabs the Hero of Time as waves of ghostly light are emitted all around them. Since that particular Breath of the Wild 2 announcement, fans have heard no more about it from Nintendo. Instead, Nintendo revealed Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity out of the blue in September 2020, with the Dynasty Warriors-spin off releasing shortly after in November. The news of Age of Calamity made it the first time in the Zelda franchise\u2019s history that both a prequel and sequel for one game were in production at the same time.","Jaccard Noise_60":0.0,"Cosine Noise_60":0.3300043643,"EM Noise_60":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_60":0,"Noise_80 Predicted Answer":"Nintendo Switch","Noise_80 Document Index":"5","Noise_80 Document":"Of course, Nintendo has a tradition of being cagey about the plot, settings, and titles of The Legend of Zelda series.

He expanded on the difficulty in developing this system, recalling how one day during development he entered an area in the game and found that all the objects had been blown away by the wind.[3] In the early stage of development, the game was to include \"double hookshots\", a variation of the hookshot present in previous Zelda games, that would let players swing \"like Spider-Man\".

We have details on everything below. Also be sure to check out our Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom review to find out why our critic loved this game so much. Shortcuts This is the first Nintendo Switch game that costs $69.99, or \u00a359.99 in the UK, both in physical and digital form. While that's disappointing, it was inevitably going to happen at some point, as that's already the price for many PS5 and Xbox Series X|S games. But if you buy it at SuperShop and enter code IGNZLDA at checkout, you'll get it for $59.99. If you want a drop-dead gorgeous new Zelda-themed model of the Switch OLED, you can grab one right here.  Based on everything we've seen so far, Tears of the Kingdom is shaping up to be a truly massive game with tons of things to do and surprises to find. You can get some help on that front with the official guide to the game, available in collector's and standard editions. Also available are a Zelda-themed Pro Controller (sold out at the time of this writing) and a Switch carrying case.","Jaccard Noise_20":1.0,"Cosine Noise_20":0.9871771336,"EM Noise_20":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":1,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"May 12, 2023","Noise_40 Document Index":"0","Noise_40 Document":"The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is the twentieth main installment in The Legend of Zelda series.

The announcement of Tears of the Kingdom under the name \"Breath of the Wild 2\" which Nintendo Called at the time \"The Sequel to Breath of the Wild\" was celebrated by fans across the world as Breath of the Wild was one of the most popular games on the Nintendo Switch and was known throughout the gaming community, especially after winning the Game of the Year award at the 2017 Japan Game Awards.[13] Many fans speculated about whether Princess Zelda would be a playable character or if multiplayer would be added, but when asked, Aonuma declined to answer.[14]  When the title of Tears of the Kingdom was revealed during the September 13, 2022 Nintendo Direct, many fans were unsure whether the name referred to tears as in crying, or tears as in rips.[15] Nintendo cleared up the confusion a few days later and confirmed that the name refers to tears as in crying.","Jaccard Noise_60":1.0,"Cosine Noise_60":0.9871771336,"EM Noise_60":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_60":1,"Noise_80 Predicted Answer":"May 12","Noise_80 Document Index":"5","Noise_80 Document":"It would hardly be a Zelda game if Nintendo didn't release an amiibo alongside it.

They're out now as well, though they're hard to find in stock.  One of the benefits a Nintendo Switch Online membership is that it lets you use Game Vouchers. The idea is, you buy a pair of game vouchers for $99.98, and you can use them on eligible digital games on the eShop, effectively making each game cost $49.99.  Since The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom normally costs $69.99, using a voucher basically gets you a $20 discount. Not too shabby if you're an NSO member looking to buy the game in digital format.  Nintendo has released a collector's edition of the game for $129.99.

It is present in the mechanics, story, visuals and sound. Dohta said that \"joining hands\" and cooperating with other characters is a major aspect, along with Link's ability to use his hands to create items. Link's right arm was created as a way to distinguish him from previous iterations of the character, but is also used symbolically to solve puzzles and open doors. Aonuma said the theme is also present within the story, which involves connecting to Hyrule's history.[30]  The Ascend ability was developed from a debug feature that Aonuma and Fujibayashi used to exit the caves. They agreed that it was tiresome to navigate all the way through the caves and wanted a cheat to get to the surface. Its implementation posed other challenges, such as ensuring that the player would not ascend into an empty space due to data loading problems.[31] Aonuma cited inspiration from the open-world games Red Dead Redemption 2 and The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.[32][33][34] By March 2022, Tears of the Kingdom was essentially complete, but Nintendo delayed it for a year to refine it.[35]  According to the review aggregator Metacritic, Tears of the Kingdom received \"universal acclaim\".[36]  Several critics praised the expansion of the open world introduced in Breath of the Wild.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.8168566227,"EM Noise_100":0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

Antonio Tajani from the Forza Italia party was given the position of minister of foreign affairs while the role of defense minister went to Guido Crosetto, one of the founders of the Brothers of Italy party.

Her party, until recently, was on the fringes. She was overlooked for years by Italy\u2019s male-dominated political class. She is an unmarried mother with a heavy Roman accent, always casual and blunt, gesturing with hands to the sky, lambasting \u201cwoke ideology\u201d and cancel culture.

She\u2019s also set a benchmark for a far-right politician in Western Europe, earning a level of power that\u2019s been out of reach for her counterparts in Germany and France, and doing so even after the forces propelling nationalism on the continent \u2014 a migration backlash and Euroskepticism \u2014 have waned. But Meloni\u2019s profile is distinctive, as is the path she\u2019s found for political success. Amid war in Europe, she has notably avoided the pitfalls of nationalist figures elsewhere. She\u2019s a strong NATO supporter and shows no affinity for Russian President Vladimir Putin. She has pledged not to disrupt Italy\u2019s stability and Atlantic alliances. The country, she says, won\u2019t take some authoritarian turn. What will surely change, though, is Italy\u2019s tone.

Police said Yamagami told them that he went to Okayama, another western city, where Abe was giving another campaign speech the day before the shooting, according to Kyodo News, which cited \"investigative sources.\" Yamagami denied any political motivations for the assassination, according to police.  Yamagami mentioned his mother's bankruptcy after she donated to an unnamed religious organization with which Abe had alleged ties, according to Japanese media reports.   Friday's shooting happened in a country where gun violence and political attacks rarely occur.","Jaccard Noise_80":0.0,"Cosine Noise_80":0.2149335891,"EM Noise_80":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":0,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"Chung Hwan Kwak","Noise_100 Document Index":"6","Noise_100 Document":"Tanaka also downplayed the alleged close tie between the organisation and Abe, stating that the former prime minister, not being a registered member or advisor, only delivered speeches for their \"friendly entity\", the UPF.[135][136]  On 14 July, the UC released a statement claiming that before the assassination, they reached an agreement to refund 50 million yen donated by the suspect's mother from 2004 to 2015, and that they have no more record of new donations made by her after the refund.[137] On the other hand, the 50 million yen refunded was again donated to the UC, according to the suspect's relatives.[138]  At a press conference in Seoul on 19 July 2022, Chung Hwan Kwak, a prominent leader in the UC, apologised and stated that the organisation was responsible for Abe's death, saying: \"I feel a deep responsibility [for the attack on Abe] because I heard that the motive of the attacker was associated with a grudge against donations [at the UC]. I sincerely apologize,\" he said. Kwak said that Sun Myung Moon enjoyed a close relationship with Abe's father and grandfather, stating: \"Donations from Japan have greatly contributed to Moon's activities around the world\". Kwak argued that he tried to reform the UC's Japanese branch and end the practice of spiritual sales, but that Jung Ok Yoo and other church leaders resisted and allowed the practice to continue.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.4473508,"EM Noise_100":0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

These include members of academies around the world, professors of medicine in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Iceland, and Finland, as well as professors of selected universities and research institutions in other countries. Past Nobel laureates may also nominate.[16] Until 1977, all professors of Karolinska Institute together decided on the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. That year, changes in Swedish law forced the institute to make public any documents pertaining to the Nobel Prize, and it was considered necessary to establish a legally independent body for the Prize work. Therefore, the Nobel Assembly was constituted, consisting of 50 professors at Karolinska Institute. It elects the Nobel Committee with five members who evaluate the nominees, the Secretary who is in charge of the organisation, and each year ten adjunct members to assist in the evaluation of candidates. In 1968, a provision was added that no more than three persons may share a Nobel prize.[17]  True to its mandate, the committee has chosen researchers working in the basic sciences over those who have made applied science contributions.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.7117308974,"EM Noise_100":0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

Before the hiatus, Mercedes had dominated the Japanese GP of late, winning the last six races in a row. Lewis Hamilton is a five-time winner at the Suzuka Circuit and will be seeking a sixth victory on Sunday to tie Michael Schumacher's record for the most Japan GP wins. The race will start at 1 a.m. ET on Sunday.

The result: Verstappen dominated the field and ran away with a surprise victory. The model followed that up by calling Verstappen's win at the Rolex Emilia Romagna GP in April and then nailed his wins again each of the last two weeks in Belgium and the Netherlands. Anyone who followed the model's lead on those plays has seen huge returns Now, the model has dialed in on the 2022 Formula 1 Japanese Grand Prix and just released its coveted picks and leaderboard projections.

The core of this review focuses on the Pixel Watch since it's the first time we're seeing how Google is incorporating Fitbit, which it bought in 2019 for about $2.1 billion. The Pixel Watch starts at $350 for Bluetooth and Wi-Fi and $400 for 4G LTE. For smartwatch users, there's not much new here. Heartrate tracking, fitness tracking and sleep tracking have been available for years in products from Fitbit and other companies, notably Apple. I was hoping Google's first Fitbit tie-in would bring some more groundbreaking innovations to the wearable game, especially for the price. The new Apple Watch SE is just $250 and has the same main features as the Pixel Watch. The same is true for Samsung's Galaxy Watch5, which costs $280. Google's Pixel Watch is the company's premium watch, whereas the Apple Watch SE and Galaxy Watch 5 are base models. But the features each offer are pretty similar. The main benefit I can see to the Pixel Watch is the beautiful, inconspicuous design. The round face and domed glass design make the Pixel Watch feel more luxurious. It's also made out of stainless steel, which is more expensive than cheaper aluminum smartwatch base models.","Jaccard Noise_20":0.0,"Cosine Noise_20":0.4798984528,"EM Noise_20":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":0,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"Swappa","Noise_40 Document Index":"8","Noise_40 Document":"Start by listing your Google Pixel Watch for sale on Swappa.

Starting Thursday, the ad plan will be available in Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, the U.K., and the U.S. It will then launch in Spain on Nov. 10. At $6.99 per month, Netflix Basic with Ads costs less than half of Netflix\u2019s $15.49 Standard plan and almost a third less than its ad-free $9.99 Basic plan.  In exchange for that lower price tag, subscribers who switch to the ad-supported plan will have to watch an average of five minutes of ads per hour that are set to play before and during movies and TV shows. At launch, ads will be 15 to 30 seconds in length. During an October press call, Netflix chief operating officer and product chief Greg Peters said that new movies coming to Netflix \u201cwill just have a pre-roll\u201d of ads followed by an uninterrupted viewing experience in order to \u201cpreserve that cinematic model.\u201d He added that movies that have \u201cbeen on the service for a while\u201d will have a more \u201ctraditional\u201d mix of pre-roll and mid-roll ads.

The era of huge budgets and endless hubris came to an end as the rent came due all at once. In spring and summer, Netflix, the leader in the space, hemorrhaged users for the first time in ten years, prompting a stock swoon, a swath of layoffs, and a moratorium on the blank checks the company used to dole out to Hollywood needle movers. (Sorry, Bright 2, we hardly knew you.) Plenty of analysts have tried to evaluate exactly what went wrong, and most lay the blame on a combination of a middling slate of original programming and a newfound national stinginess in the face of rising inflation. Thankfully, Netflix has humbled itself to address at least one of those issues with a new payment plan it put into action this autumn. For a teensy $6.99 per month, anyone can pay for a Netflix subscription \u2026 as long as they\u2019re willing to sit through a few commercials during playback. The plan is called Basic With Ads, and the $6.99 figure is much more aligned with consumer expectations compared with the bloated premium $20 subscription \u2014 which I discovered I was still somehow paying for over the course of reporting this story.

Schumer speaks after Dems projected to keep control of Senate  The 2022 midterm elections shaped up to be some of the most consequential in the nation's recent history, with control of Congress at stake. All 435 seats in the House and 35 of 100 seats in the Senate were on the ballot, as well as several influential gubernatorial elections in battleground states like Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Democrats were defending their narrow majorities in both chambers and retained control of the Senate, though control of the House isn't yet clear. But a Republican flip of the lower chamber would be enough to curtail most of President Joe Biden's legislative agenda and would likely result in investigations against his administration and even his family.

In 2020, that worked to their advantage, and Democrats gained control of the chamber. In 2018, Democrats spent more, but the GOP gained House majority. Voter turnout is typically much lower in non-presidential elections. Since the 1980s, midterm voter turnout has hovered around 40%, whereas presidential cycles have reached over 60%. However, turnout during the Trump administration was high, particularly in the 2018 midterm election, which gave Nancy Pelosi her second stint as Speaker of the House. But because the stakes of the midterms were high this year, we saw more people turning up to the booths. After the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, Democrats used abortion rights to win special elections in places like New York\u2019s Hudson Valley, in addition to flipping Alaska\u2019s lone House seat.

In the 22 midterm elections from 1934 -2018, the President's party has averaged a loss of 28 House seats and four Senate seats. The president\u2019s party gained seats in the House only three times, but gained seats in the Senate on six occasions. The president\u2019s party has gained seats in both houses only twice. The incumbent president\u2019s ability to launch new major policy initiatives would be greatly weakened under divided government. If the Democrats lose control of either House, the Administration can expect to be the target of numerous disruptive congressional inquiries. Using the data we discuss below (and provide here) we would expect Democratic seat losses of around 30 in the House and 3 in the Senate. There are large error bounds around these estimates. The prediction range includes the possibility of a narrow Democratic gain in the Senate, but loss of the majority in the House seems likely. Graphs below show the two-variable relationships. Democrats have a 9 seat margin currently in the House (with four seats vacant) and the parties are tied in the Senate. A Democratic loss in the House of fewer than 12 seats would be very unexpected. Like many midterm projections, these estimates are based on aggregated data. There is no measure of current national controversies (for example, abortion or Trump-related litigation controversies). Both will affect turnout. Nor do we have any explicit measure of conditions and candidates in specific elections.","Jaccard Noise_80":0.0,"Cosine Noise_80":0.6566407681,"EM Noise_80":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":0,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"Republicans","Noise_100 Document Index":"3","Noise_100 Document":"Copyright 2023 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. Control of the U.S. Congress remained hanging in the balance on Wednesday morning as Democrats have shown surprising strength, defying expectations and defeating Republicans in a series of competitive races. (Nov. 9) WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Republicans inched closer to a narrow House majority Wednesday, while control of the Senate hinged on a few tight races in a midterm election that defied expectations of sweeping conservative victories driven by frustration over inflation and President Joe Biden\u2019s leadership. Either party could secure a Senate majority with wins in both Nevada and Arizona \u2014 where the races were too early to call. But there was a strong possibility that, for the second time in two years, the Senate majority could come down to a runoff in Georgia next month, with Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock and Herschel Walker failing to earn enough votes to win outright. In the House, Republicans on Wednesday night were within a dozen seats of the 218 needed to take control, while Democrats kept seats in districts from Virginia to Pennsylvania to Kansas and many West Coast contests were still too early to call. In a particularly symbolic victory for the GOP, Sean Patrick Maloney of New York, the House Democratic campaign chief, lost his bid for a sixth term. Control of Congress will decide how the next two years of Biden\u2019s term play out, and whether he is able to achieve more of his agenda or will see it blocked by a new GOP majority.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.9768142104,"EM Noise_100":0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

The governor\u2019s race is within the margin of error, but the senate race is not. The Nevada Election Survey Project 2022 general election poll, which asked nearly 600 likely Nevada voters about their voting intentions and views on state and national officials, found 52% of Nevadans plan to vote for Cortez Masto, 39% for Adam Laxalt and 5% remain undecided. Cortez Masto\u2019s large lead reflects less Republican voter enthusiasm for Laxalt\u2019s candidacy compared to Joe Lombardo and other Republican candidates. Among likely Republican voters, 74% said they planned to support Laxalt, compared to 83% for Lombardo and 88% for their Republican House of Representatives candidate.

Georgia DL Jalen Carter:\u00a0The Georgia defense has turned into a factory for first-round NFL Draft picks, and Carter is projected to be a top-10 selection next spring. That's because he has been an incredibly disruptive force in the middle of the defensive line all year.

He has the ability to stuff the Ohio State run game while also generating pressure up the middle on the pass rush.

Here\u2019s all the information we know about the Rebel Moon release date. Netflix set the Rebel Moon release date for December 22, 2023. One of the most-anticipated movies in 2023, Rebel Moon was penned by Snyder, Shay Hatten, and Kurt Johnstad. Snyder has directed many movies that can be labeled as sci-fi, proof is his long commitment to the DC Universe superheroes in what was nicknamed the \u201cSnyderverse.\u201d However, Space Moon will be his first space opera. The 57-year-old director started his partnership with Netflix with 2021\u2019s Army of the Dead, a zombie movie that featured an epic heist.  Inspired by Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa and Star Wars, Rebel Moon follows a peaceful colony dealing with an oppressive regent. Still, many details are under wrap, and the movie hasn\u2019t even got a trailer. Yet, Netflix believes so very much in the Rebel Moon potential of the film that a sequel is being filmed back-to-back. Originally, Snyder approached Lucasfilm with his story, but the project never sailed there. Instead, it took the current form after the involvement of producer Eric Newman.","Jaccard Noise_40":0.6666666667,"Cosine Noise_40":0.8899132609,"EM Noise_40":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":1,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"Dec. 22","Noise_60 Document Index":"3","Noise_60 Document":"Inspired by the classic 1954 Akira Kurosawa film\u00a0Seven Samurai,\u00a0Rebel Moon is a big-canvas ballad of galactic resistance as only Snyder could portray it.

{"Query":"What is the title of the AI-generated episode of Seinfeld?","Correct Answer":["Nothing, Forever"],"Noise_0 Predicted Answer":"Nothing, Forever","Noise_0 Document Index":"0","Noise_0 Document":"Front page layout Site theme  Benj Edwards     -  Feb 6, 2023 5:10 pm UTC  Since December 14, a Twitch channel called Nothing, Forever has been streaming a live, endless AI-generated Seinfeld episode that features pixelated cartoon versions of characters from the TV show. On Monday, Twitch gave the channel a 14-day ban after language model tools from OpenAI went haywire and generated transphobic content that violated community guidelines. Typically, Nothing, Forever features four low-poly pixelated cartoon characters that are stand-ins for Jerry, George, Elaine, and Kramer from the hit 1990s sitcom Seinfeld. They sit around a New York apartment and talk about life, and sometimes the topics of conversation unexpectedly get deep, such as in this viewer-captured segment where they discussed the afterlife. Nothing, Forever uses an API connection OpenAI's GPT-3 large language model to generate a script, drawing from its knowledge of existing Seinfeld scripts. Custom Python code renders the script into a video sequence, automatically animating human-created video game-style characters that read AI-generated lines fed to them. One of its creators provided more technical details on how it works in a Reddit comment from December. As a new media experiment, the faux-Seinfeld stream often feels awkward and unfunny, but it's still interesting because viewers never know what the characters will talk about next.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":1.0,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"NOTHING, FOREVER","Noise_20 Document Index":"1","Noise_20 Document":"Feb 4, 2023 ...

Other examples are Kramer getting his jacket back and Elaine heading the \"Peterman catalog\". Larry David, the head writer and executive producer for the first seven seasons, was praised for keeping a close eye on minor details and making sure the main characters' lives remained consistent and believable. Curb Your Enthusiasm, David's later comedy series, expanded on this idea by following a specific theme for all but one season in the series.  A major difference between Seinfeld and sitcoms that preceded it is that the principal characters never learn from their mistakes. In effect, they are indifferent and even callous toward the outside world and sometimes one another. A mantra of the show's producers was \"No hugging, no learning.\"[52] Entertainment Weekly's TV critic Ken Tucker has described them as \"a group dynamic rooted in jealousy, rage, insecurity, despair, hopelessness, and a touching lack of faith in one's fellow human beings.\"[53] This leads to very few happy endings, except at somebody else's expense. More often in every episode, situations resolve with characters getting a justly deserved comeuppance.  The show premiered as The Seinfeld Chronicles on July 5, 1989. After it aired, a pickup by NBC seemed unlikely and the show was offered to Fox, which declined to pick it up.","Jaccard Noise_40":0.0,"Cosine Noise_40":0.1441532671,"EM Noise_40":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":0,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"Nothing, Forever","Noise_60 Document Index":"2","Noise_60 Document":"Feb 2, 2023 ...

Also at this time, the use of Jerry's stand-up act slowly declined, and the stand-up segment in the middle of Seinfeld episodes was cut.  Much publicity followed the controversial episode, \"The Contest\", an Emmy Award-winning episode written by David, whose subject matter was considered inappropriate for prime time network TV. To circumvent this taboo, the word \"masturbation\" was never used in the script, instead substituted for by a variety of oblique references.[66] Midway through that season, Seinfeld was moved from its original 9:00\u00a0p.m. time slot on Wednesdays to 9:30\u00a0p.m. on Thursdays, following Cheers again, which gave the show even more popularity. Ratings also sparked the move, as Tim Allen's sitcom Home Improvement on ABC had aired at the same time and Improvement kept beating Seinfeld in the ratings.

The overhaul deploys OpenAI's ChatGPT technology, which has taken the world by storm since its launch last year. The move is by far the biggest threat Google has seen to its dominance in web search - and marks the beginning of an AI arms race between the companies. \"The race starts today,\" Microsoft boss Satya Nadella said.  Developed by Microsoft-backed OpenAI, ChatGPT uses deep learning techniques to generate human-like responses to search requests. Mr Nadella said he thought it was poised to change the nature of online search - and interactions with many other software.  \"This technology will reshape pretty much every software category that we know,\" he said.  Bing will now respond to search queries with more detailed answers - not just links to websites.  Users are also able to chat with the bot to better tailor their queries. More contextual answers will be added on the right hand side of a search page. The new Bing search engine will be live right away - with a limited number of searches for each person.  The announcement comes a day after Google revealed details of its own new chatbot, Bard. Both companies are scrambling to get their products to market.  In a note to investors after the announcement, analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities said he thought that Microsoft's investment would \"massively boost\" the firm's ability to compete.","Jaccard Noise_20":0.0,"Cosine Noise_20":0.2609081566,"EM Noise_20":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":0,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"OpenAI","Noise_40 Document Index":"3","Noise_40 Document":"\"This is just the first step on the AI front ... as [the] AI arms race takes place among Big Tech,\" he said.

Microsoft said Bing will use OpenAI technology that is even more advanced than the ChatGPT technology unveiled last year. The powers will also be incorporated into its Edge web browser.  Analysts say ChatGPT - which has been used by students to pass exams and tests - has the potential to be incredibly disruptive to multiple professions, including journalism.

In midday trading, iRobot shares rose 19%. Amazon's were down 1.4%. The deal comes as anti-monopoly advocates continue to raise concerns about Amazon's increasing dominance. The purchase of iRobot is Amazon's fourth-largest acquisition, led by its $13.7 billion deal to buy Whole Foods in 2017. Last month, the company said it would buy the primary care provider One Medical in a deal valued roughly at $3.9 billion, a move that expanded its reach further into health care. On Friday, groups advocating for stricter antitrust regulations called on regulators to block the iRobot merger, arguing it gives Amazon more access into consumers' lives and furthers its dominance in the smart home market. \"The last thing American and the world needs is Amazon vacuuming up even more of our personal information,\" said Robert Weissman, president of the progressive consumer rights advocacy group Public Citizen. \"This is not just about Amazon selling another device in its marketplace,\" Weissman said. \"It's about the company gaining still more intimate details of our lives to gain unfair market advantage and sell us more stuff.","Jaccard Noise_20":1.0,"Cosine Noise_20":1.0,"EM Noise_20":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":1,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"Amazon","Noise_40 Document Index":"3","Noise_40 Document":"A slew of home-cleaning robots adds to the company's tech arsenal, making it more involved in consumer's lives beyond static things like voice control.

The company hasn't had much success with household robots, but the iRobot acquisition and the company's strong market reputation provide a \"massive foothold in the consumer robot market\" that could help Amazon replicate the success of its Echo line of smart speakers, said Lian Jye Su, a robotics industry analyst for ABI Research. Su said it also illustrates the shortcomings of consumer robotics vendors like iRobot, which struggled to expand beyond a niche product and was in a \"race-to-the-bottom\" competition with Korean and Chinese manufacturers offering cheaper versions of a robotic vacuum. On Friday, iRobot reported its quarterly results. Revenue plunged 30% primarily on order reductions and delays, and the company announced it was laying off 10% of its workforce.

Prior to the possession rule change, 10 of the 11 playoff games that went to overtime under the post-2010 overtime rule changes were won by the team that received the ball first.","Jaccard Noise_40":0.0,"Cosine Noise_40":0.2983515561,"EM Noise_40":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":0,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"Eagles","Noise_60 Document Index":"7","Noise_60 Document":"It marked Rihanna's first live performance in over five years.[110][111] In a red outfit, she sang portions of twelve of her songs including \"Where Have You Been\", \"Only Girl (In the World)\", and \"Work\".[112] Justina Miles performed the halftime show in American Sign Language for the first time in Super Bowl History.[113]  After Kansas City won the coin toss and deferred their choice to the second half, Philadelphia began the game with the ball.

In general in RL, you want to achieve the highest reward. In RLHF we use a Reward Model, which is imperfect and given the chance, the PPO algorithm will exploit these imperfections. This can manifest itself as sudden increases in reward, however when we look at the text generations from the policy, they mostly contain repetitions of the string ```, as the reward model found the stack exchange answers containing blocks of code usually rank higher than ones without it.

You can also choose between three official Pixel Fold cases that come in Hazel, Porcelain, and Bay colors (pictured above). Google is charging a similar price to the rival Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4. The 256GB variant of the Pixel Fold will cost you a whopping $1,799. The 512GB version is even more expensive at $1,919, which seems costly for Google\u2019s first attempt at a foldable phone. Google hopes you buy the foldable Pixel for its thin form factor, \u201ctrue pocket size,\u201d loaded camera features, \u201call-day battery,\u201d multi-tasking skills, and long-lasting software support. However, we\u2019ll only know if it justifies that price when we review the device. As for availability, Google is not casting a very wide net for the Pixel Fold. The handset will only sell in the US, UK, Germany, and Japan, at least to start with.","Jaccard Noise_60":0.25,"Cosine Noise_60":0.6674079895,"EM Noise_60":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_60":0,"Noise_80 Predicted Answer":"May 10th","Noise_80 Document Index":"5","Noise_80 Document":"May 11, 2023 ...

When I recently turned on Google\u2019s new Pixel Fold smartphone and unfolded it as if it were a book, it transformed into a miniature tablet, similar to an iPad Mini or an Amazon Fire. Then something unexpected happened. For the next few hours, I found it difficult to put the device down, as if I were sucked into a great novel. The phone\u2019s performance was smooth and fast, and the bigger screen made reading emails, watching videos and reading comic books more delightful than on a normal phone screen. I was surprised because I have been wary of foldable phones. The earliest models released by Samsung, Motorola and Huawei about four years ago had glaring flaws. They were thick and heavy, had durability issues and lacked software to take advantage of their novel hardware.

The US labor market is on a smooth trajectory, but turmoil in the financial market could cause turbulence. This labor market continues to work for workers. Unemployment is very low, but the continued progress in enticing people into the workforce is perhaps more encouraging. The labor force participation rate for workers ages 25 to 54 hit a level previously seen in March 2008, and the last time the employment rate for these workers was this high was May 2001.

{"Query":"What is the name of Google's AI image editing tool?","Correct Answer":["Magic Editor"],"Noise_0 Predicted Answer":"Magic Editor","Noise_0 Document Index":"7","Noise_0 Document":"By  Emma Roth, a news writer who covers the streaming wars, consumer tech, crypto, social media, and much more. Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.  One of the most impressive demos at Google I\/O started with a photo of a woman in front of a waterfall. A presenter onstage tapped on the woman, picked her up, and moved her to the other side of the image, with the app automatically filling in the space where she once stood. They then tapped on the overcast sky, and it instantly bloomed into a brighter cloudless blue. In just a matter of seconds, the image had been transformed. The AI-powered tool, dubbed the Magic Editor, certainly lived up to its name during the demo. It\u2019s the kind of tool that Google has been building toward for years. It already has a couple of AI-powered image editing features in its arsenal, including the Magic Eraser, which lets you quickly remove people or objects from the background of an image. But this type of tool takes things up a notch by letting you alter the contents \u2014 and potentially, the meaning \u2014 of a photo in much more significant ways. While it\u2019s clear that this tool isn\u2019t flawless\u00a0\u2014 and there remains no firm release date for it \u2014 Google\u2019s end goal is clear: to make perfecting photos as easy as just tapping or dragging something on your screen.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.9999998808,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Magic Editor","Noise_20 Document Index":"1","Noise_20 Document":"May 10, 2023 ...

Image creation is one of the more intriguing applications for this technology, and Google\u2019s efforts in this area materialized as Imagen, a text-based image generation tool much like Midjourney and DALL-E 2. Now, Google is sharing research showcasing Imagen Editor, where textual prompts and a little sketching can suffice to perform local edits on photos. Google\u2019s Imagen utility is already adept at creating images from scratch, solely off of textual prompts. However, if you aren\u2019t satisfied with the result, you\u2019re usually forced to restructure your prompt, polish it, and give the image generator another go, simply because Imagen doesn\u2019t yet allow editing specific elements of images you aren\u2019t happy with. To address this, Google recently shared research for Imagen Editor and EditBench, utilities currently in beta, but capable of guiding edits with text prompts. Instead of creating fresh images using a prompt, Imagen Editor needs a photo that must be edited, a text prompt from the user defining the change, and a masked region defining where the edit needs to be applied. The result is edits limited to the region you defined, tailored to the prompt provided. Moreover, the results are photorealistic and natural.","Jaccard Noise_80":0.0,"Cosine Noise_80":0.3289404511,"EM Noise_80":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":0,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"Fotor","Noise_100 Document Index":"3","Noise_100 Document":"Fotor is a powerful all-in-one ai photo editor app for everyone, including photo editing tools, design maker and photo collage maker.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.3029913008,"EM Noise_100":0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

It is not like augmented reality glasses, however, as it is designed to completely cover the eyes and block out all of your surroundings.   Apple is using exterior and interior cameras for the augmented reality component of the device. The cameras are able to map the space around you and project the real world back to you, so though you're not actually looking at what's around you using see-through glasses, you are effectively seeing an accurate picture of your real world environment.  With this capability, Apple can show you 3D windows, objects, and content in your actual space, or the cameras can be turned off to shut out the world to provide an entirely virtual setting. Apple is focusing on the headset's ability to allow for working, content consumption, gaming, communication and other activities to be done \"anywhere\" with just the Vision Pro.","Jaccard Noise_40":1.0,"Cosine Noise_40":1.0,"EM Noise_40":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":1,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"$3,500","Noise_60 Document Index":"2","Noise_60 Document":"Jun 11, 2023 ...

At its annual developer conference, Apple also introduced a raft of new products and features, including a 15-inch MacBook Air, a powerful chip called M2 Ultra, improvements to its iOS software and a long-awaited tweak to prevent its autocorrect from annoyingly changing a common expletive to \"ducking\". The Vision Pro will start at $3,499, more than three times the cost of the priciest headset in Meta's line of mixed and virtual reality devices. The headset will test a market crowded with devices that have yet to gain traction with consumers and put it in direct competition with Facebook-owner Meta after years of clashes between the companies over issues like user privacy and control of developer platforms. Apple emphasized the novelty of the headset's augmented reality features as well as the sports and entertainment partnerships it would offer. The device will use a new chip called R1 that will process information from its sensors in less time than the blink of an eye, Apple said. But the announcements failed to excite Wall Street, which had bid up Apple shares to a record high ahead of the launch.

The headset will initially be available in the U.S. only, so we do not have pricing for other countries at this time.

At its annual developer conference, Apple also introduced a raft of new products and features, including a 15-inch MacBook Air, a powerful chip called M2 Ultra, improvements to its iOS software and a long-awaited tweak to prevent its autocorrect from annoyingly changing a common expletive to \"ducking\". The Vision Pro will start at $3,499, more than three times the cost of the priciest headset in Meta's line of mixed and virtual reality devices. The headset will test a market crowded with devices that have yet to gain traction with consumers and put it in direct competition with Facebook-owner Meta after years of clashes between the companies over issues like user privacy and control of developer platforms. Apple emphasized the novelty of the headset's augmented reality features as well as the sports and entertainment partnerships it would offer. The device will use a new chip called R1 that will process information from its sensors in less time than the blink of an eye, Apple said. But the announcements failed to excite Wall Street, which had bid up Apple shares to a record high ahead of the launch. The stock was largely flat in post-market trading.","Jaccard Noise_40":1.0,"Cosine Noise_40":0.9999999404,"EM Noise_40":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":1,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"xrOS","Noise_60 Document Index":"2","Noise_60 Document":"Dec 3, 2022 ...

Design wise, the Vision Pro looks similar to a pair of ski goggles, albeit high-end goggles. It features a laminated glass front, which Apple says was \"three-dimensionally formed.\" The glass is attached to a curved aluminum alloy frame that wraps around the face. As of now, the headset is only available in silver with matching gray Light Seals and bands.  The frame connects magnetically to a Light Seal that sits on the face, and Apple offers the Light Seal in a range of sizes and shapes to fit different faces. A tight fit with the Light Seal is essential for blocking out light and proper operation of the headset. Apple designed the Light Seal to be flexible so that it can conform to individual face shapes.   At the side of the headset, there are two audio straps that are equipped with speakers that support spatial audio.
