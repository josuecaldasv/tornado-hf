It comes from in-house producer Jennie Snyder Urman, who created and executive produced Jane The Virgin. She currently serves as executive producer on the CW\u2019s Charmed and CBS\u2019s midseason sitcom Broke. The writer is Katie Wech, who previously worked with Urman as co-executive producer on Jane the Virgin. Prior to Good Sam, she wrote ABC's pilot The Hypnotist\u2019s Love Story, based on the Liane Moriarty book, which didn't make it to series for good reasons (read my script review). Most recently, she was one of the many writers hired for Fox\u2019s summer series BH90210. This is also the second year CBS has developed a drama pilot for Sophia Bush. In 2019, she headlined Surveillance, a suspenseful spy thriller (read my preview) which reportedly \"tested through the roof\" but was ultimately determined not to be a good fit for the network.

What microchip shortage? EV maker Tesla, which it should be pointed out produces its own chips in-house, seems not to have been bothered by supply-chain issues all that much in 2021, delivering 936,172 vehicles in the year just ended, according to a report by finance news outlet Finbold. That represents a healthy 87 percent increase over 2020, when the company handed over 499,550 Teslas to customers. Even better for the company, it ended the year with a bang, racking up a record number of sales in the last quarter of 2021, or 308,600 units. Most of that total consisted of Model 3 and Model Y models, no surprise. It\u2019s the sixth consecutive quarter that it breaks its record for sales. In 2019, the automaker delivered 367,500 units, so annual sales growth, while not exponential, is clearly accelerating. The company has said in the past that one its main goals is to attain 50 percent sales growth year after year. Once upon a time, Tesla struggled mightily to hit its delivery targets, but no more. There\u2019s also no sign of that growth slowing down any time soon, even as all-electric rivals join the market by the month. Projections made by Finbold put estimated sales for 2022 at over 1.5 million units, for an increase of close to 65 percent.

We even covered their phased approach to reopening in April of that year, back when we all naive enough to think the pandemic would be over by August. Who knew we had to clarify August of which year. Well, since then EVO has continued to grow, adding more screens, bowling lanes and video games. At the end of last year EVO was operating 71 screens across nine locations as well as 38 bowling lanes and full service restaurants in three of its sites. In the first week of this year, EVO acquired 100% of ShowBiz Cinemas, a Texas-based chain with 89 screens and 79 bowling lanes across nine locations in Texas, Oklahoma, Florida, and Wyoming. The founders of both circuits are related to Lee Roy Mitchell, founder and Executive Chairman of Cinemark; Kevin Mitchell of ShowBiz Cinemas is his son and Mitch Roberts of EVO is his grandson.

The glasses, known internally by the codename Iris, were shelved earlier this year following layoffs, reshuffles, and the departure of Clay Bavor, Google's chief of augmented and virtual reality, according to three people familiar with the matter. A Google spokesperson declined to comment. The Verge first reported on the existence of Project Iris in January 2022, describing the device as resembling a pair of ski goggles. However, Google employees said the \"ski goggles\" were actually the foundations of a separate AR project that's since been announced as a partner product with Samsung, while Iris was a series of devices more closely resembling eyeglasses. Google planned to build and launch Iris as its own product, and it shored up talent through acquisitions. In 2020, the company announced it had purchased North, a Canadian startup that made AR glasses. An early version of Iris closely resembled North's first device, the Focals, while a later version that Google publicly demoed had translation features. Since shelving the Iris glasses, Google has focused on creating software platforms for AR that it hopes to license to other manufacturers building headsets. It's building an Android XR platform for Samsung's headset and has been working on a \"micro XR\" platform for glasses, a person familiar with the plan said.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.5,"Cosine Noise_0":0.8667027354,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":0,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Project Iris","Noise_20 Document Index":"2","Noise_20 Document":"12]  In January 2022, The Verge reported that Google was building an AR headset which used \"outward-facing cameras to blend computer graphics with a video feed of the real world\", internally codenamed Project Iris and being developed in a highly secretive and secure facility located in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Amazon\u2019s recently-published online game Lost Ark has broken several playtime records on the Steam digital storefront. Lost Ark, developed by Smilegate RPG, is a massively-multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) that originally launched in South Korea in late 2019. Players enter the world of Arkesia as young warriors, mages, martial artists, and magic-users, who\u2019ve been chosen by prophecy to search for artifacts capable of saving the world from an awakening force of chaos. Upon its launch on Feb. 11, Lost Ark rapidly climbed Steam\u2019s charts to hit an all-time peak of 1,325,305 players on Feb. 12, as shown by independent trackers like SteamDB. This is the second-highest number for concurrent players ever tracked on Steam, behind the record of 3.26 million that was set in 2018 by PlayerUnknown\u2019s Battlegrounds, and the highest number period for any MMORPG on Steam. This also made Lost Ark the highest-played game on Steam in the 24 hours following its debut. Additionally, Lost Ark was popular among livestreamers and their audiences on Amazon\u2019s Twitch online broadcasting platform.","Jaccard Noise_20":0.6666666667,"Cosine Noise_20":0.7681039572,"EM Noise_20":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":0,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"February 11,","Noise_40 Document Index":"8","Noise_40 Document":"Update 2\/16\/2022: Amazon Games and Smilegate have announced some updated numbers for Lost Ark's big opening weekend, including a peak of over 1.2 million concurrent viewers on Twitch and over 59.9 million hours watched cumulatively during launch week. Additionally, in the first three days of its launch, Lost Ark gained over 4.7 million new registered players in the West. Original story: Following its official free-to-play launch on February 11, Lost Ark has already become Steam's second most-played game of all time by concurrent players with an all-time peak of 1,325,305 people. As revealed by SteamDB, Lost Ark passed Counter-Strike: Global Offensive's all-time peak of 1,308,963 players to secure the #2 spot. Considering these all-time peaks tend to happen around a game's release, it may be quite an uphill battle to take down PUBG's record of 3,257,248 players at one time.

Amazon\u2019s recently-published online game Lost Ark has broken several playtime records on the Steam digital storefront. Lost Ark, developed by Smilegate RPG, is a massively-multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) that originally launched in South Korea in late 2019.

Well, developer Smilegate and Lost Ark\u2018s Western publisher Amazon Games haven\u2019t shared any plans to port the game to Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, or the Epic Games store, but given that the title does offer partial controller support via Steam, it\u2019s not unreasonable to think that it could one day be made available to an even wider audience.  In short, anyone hoping to jump into Lost Ark when it goes free-to-play on Friday should probably plan to start playing the game as soon as possible.

Lost Ark is quickly proving to be one of Steam\u2019s biggest hits of 2022, but the game\u2019s complicated release structure has many people wondering what time the red hot title will fully be released and when they\u2019ll be able to join the millions that are already exploring the game that has a lot of people talking.  Originally released (in full) in South Korea in 2019, Lost Ark is an MMORPG with Diablo-like ARPG combat. The game quickly grew a sizeable fanbase in that region thanks to its PvP mechanics, extensive content offerings, cinematic style, and all those other MMO tropes that usually encourage people to gleefully spend a few hundred hours of their lives playing them.  So, while Lost Ark has been playable in South Korea and other regions for quite some time, those in the West who recently pre-ordered any of the Lost Ark Founder\u2019s Pack on Steam were also able to start playing the game yesterday (February 8). You\u2019re still able to start playing the game right now if you decide to buy a Founder\u2019s Pack for the MMO via Steam (each of which comes with a variety of in-game rewards as well as early access to the title).","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.6644347906,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

There\u2019s no denying, though, that a major part of its appeal stems from James Spader\u2019s scenery-chewing performance as the enigmatic yet compelling Reddington, and it remains one of his best roles.

The most common answer was not an already announced game or theoretical sequel, but actually DLC for an existing game, namely this year\u2019s GOTY frontrunner, Elden Ring. And doing the math, announcing DLC for Elden Ring at the Game Awards, a show where it seems somewhat likely to win Game of the Year, actually may add up quite perfectly. With Elden Ring debuting in late February 2022, early December would be just over nine months after the release of the game. Elden Ring is already on the late side when it comes to debuting DLC compared to previous FromSoftware games, as I\u2019ve documented in the past:   So, by this time, Dark Souls 2 and 3 and Bloodborne all had DLC out. In terms of just announcement of DLC, we are way past due. Bloodborne\u2019s Old Hunters DLC was announced six months after release, two months before it came out. Dark Souls 2\u2019s DLC was announced only three months after the game launched. Elden Ring What\u2019s taking so long? Well, as ever, we are suffering from the lingering effects of three years of COVID delays, which has made 2022 a relatively barren year for games in general, with a few exceptions, Elden Ring included.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.25,"Cosine Noise_100":0.7047149539,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

While the latest chip won't officially ship in smartphones for a few months, Geekbench scores for the chip have already been spotted in an unreleased Android handset.

While Apple\u2019s latest iPhone models feature some nice enhancements \u2014 especially for the more expensive iPhone 14 Pro \u2014 Apple has also taken one thing away with this latest iPhone release. For the first time in the history of the iPhone, Apple is removing the slot for a physical SIM card. Instead, all iPhone 14 models sold in the U.S. will exclusively use embedded SIMs (eSIMs). It\u2019s not the first time Apple has removed a physical connector to slim down the iPhone and make space for other more important components. In 2016, Apple \u201ccourageously\u201d removed the 3.5mm headphone jack from the iPhone 7, citing the emerging era of wireless headphones. It likely wasn\u2019t a coincidence that Apple debuted the original AirPods at that same event. Perhaps ironically, this latest change brings the iPhone 14 into line with Steve Jobs\u2019 original visions for its design. Earlier this year, former Apple executive Tony Fadell shared how Apple\u2019s legendary co-founder and CEO was initially very much against the idea of having a SIM card slot on the original iPhone. During an interview with Joanna Stern at a special event for The Computer History Museum, Fadell explained how the oft-mercurial Apple CEO told the designers and engineers working on the original iPhone that \u201cwe don\u2019t need another hole in it.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.2649406195,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

The M2 chip is here, ushering in the second generation of Apple's bespoke silicon The Apple M2 chip was unveiled at Apple's WWDC 2022 keynote on June 6, and it's the inaugural chip in Apple's second generation of bespoke silicon. This is significant because the M2 is an evolution of the remarkable M1 chip that debuted in 2020, and it powers Apple's new 13-inch MacBook Air 2022 and MacBook Pro 2022. These are successors to two of the best MacBooks on the market, so it's exciting to see what an M2 injection can do. The new Apple M2 chip debuted in two new laptops: the 13-inch MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, which launched in the Summer of 2022. The M2 chip is available in either the 13-inch MacBook Air 2022 (starting price: $1,199) or the MacBook Pro 2022 ($1,299), so you'll need to pay over $1k to get yourself an M2-powered MacBook.  It's also available in the Mac mini M2, a cheaper and more powerful version of Apple's pint-sized Mac.

The M2 chip is built upon the new second-generation 5nm architecture, with Apple claiming it offers an 18% CPU performance increase on the existing M1 processor.  But just because this is Apple\u2019s latest chip for Macs, it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the most powerful. Just like the M1 chip, the M2 is designed for entry-level devices such as the  MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro. And with an 8-core CPU, the M2 chip isn\u2019t as powerful as the likes of the M1 Pro and M1 Max, which are found in the 14-inch an 16-inch MacBook Pro laptops.  Keep reading on for everything you need to know about the new M2 chip.  The Apple M2 chip debuted inside both the MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro, both of which launched in Summer 2022.  At launch, the cheapest device with the M2 will be the MacBook Air at $1199\/\u00a31249 \u2013 and at that price, you only get an 8-core GPU.

The M2 is Apple's next-generation System on a Chip (SoC) developed for use in Macs and iPads. It marks Apple's continued work to transition away from the Intel chips that were used in Macs up until 2020. As a \"System on a Chip,\" the M2 integrates several different components, including the CPU, GPU, unified memory architecture (RAM), Neural Engine, Secure Enclave, SSD controller, image signal processor, encode\/decode engines, Thunderbolt controller with USB 4 support, and more, all of which power the different features in the Mac. Before Apple silicon, Macs used multiple chips for CPU, I\/O, and security, but Apple's effort to integrate these chips is the reason why the M2 is much faster and more efficient than Intel chips. The unified memory architecture that Apple has included is also a major factor because all of the technologies in the M2 are able to access the same data without having to swap between multiple pools of memory. Built into the M2 chip, the unified memory architecture means the CPU, GPU, and other processor components don't need to copy data between one another, and are able to access the same data pool.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.3333333333,"Cosine Noise_100":0.7838338614,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

Katherine, who has achieved a level of privatization beyond the alphabetical designation, describes power as the ability to bypass image entirely\u2014the ultimate status symbol is to not be perceived. Tess, Katherine\u2019s true-believer follower, doesn\u2019t register privacy as something to treasure. Instead, as she observes the Pioneers, she reminds herself of how much good might come from the obliteration of privacy in favor of an algorithm that could predict someone\u2019s choices. For Tess, \u201call \u2018privacy\u2019 meant was the degree to which a person allowed their choices, preferences, and feelings to be known, and every day people traded their privacy for privileges, goods, and services.\u201d As the avatar for Sensus\u2019 plan for the future, she deeply creeps out almost everyone who meets her; internalizing the company\u2019s ideas about commodifying humanity saps Tess of her own.

Musk had begun buying shares of the company in January 2022, becoming its largest shareholder by April with a 9.1\u00a0percent ownership stake. Twitter invited Musk to join its board of directors, an offer he initially accepted before declining. On April 14, Musk made an unsolicited offer to purchase the company, to which Twitter's board initially responded with a \"poison pill\" strategy to resist a hostile takeover, before unanimously accepting Musk's buyout offer of $44\u00a0billion on April 25. Musk stated that he planned to introduce new features to the platform, make its algorithms open-source, combat spambot accounts, and promote free speech.  In July, Musk announced his intention to terminate the agreement, asserting that Twitter had breached their agreement by refusing to crack down on spambot accounts. The company filed a lawsuit against Musk in the Delaware Court of Chancery shortly thereafter, with a trial scheduled for the week of October 17. Weeks before the trial was set to begin, Musk reversed course, announcing that he would move forward with the acquisition. The deal was closed on October 27, with Musk immediately becoming Twitter's new owner and CEO. Twitter was taken private and merged into a new parent company named X Corp.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":1.0,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Elon Musk","Noise_20 Document Index":"3","Noise_20 Document":"Profile Sections tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News A lot has happened since Elon Musk completed his acquisition of Twitter last month \u2014 layoffs of thousands of employees, firings of engineers critical of him and an impersonation of an official Eli Lilly account that caused the pharmaceutical company's stock to drop.

But Musk provided little clarity on how he will achieve his goals.  read more Earlier this month, Musk brought the deal back on the table after previously trying to walk away from it. Musk had said he was excited to buy Twitter but he and his co-investors are overpaying. Musk pledged to provide $46.5 billion in equity and debt financing for the acquisition, which covered the $44 billion price tag and the closing costs. Banks, including Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), committed to provide $13 billion in debt financing. Experts have said commitments from banks to the deal were firm and tight, limiting their ability to walk away from the contract despite the prospect that they may face major losses. Musk's $33.5 billion equity commitment included his 9.6% Twitter stake, which is worth $4 billion, and the $7.1 billion he had secured from equity investors, including Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) co-founder Larry Ellison and Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.9033486843,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"$2.64\u00a0billion,[11]","Noise_20 Document Index":"1","Noise_20 Document":"[8] Days later, he discussed the future of social media with Twitter co-founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey and explored the possibility of joining Twitter's board of directors with private equity firm Silver Lake co-CEO Egon Durban.

Can Iga Swiatek cement her status as the best in the world? And what about Rafael Nadal? Can he re-create the magic from a year ago? Our experts attempt to answer these questions and make their own predictions as the first Grand Slam of the year starts on Monday. James Blake: Jessica Pegula will win this year. She has the best attitude and consistent results. She proved already this year that her top level can be as good as anyone's. She has always had the mindset of improvement, and it seems to be paying off with impressive results. I think it's just a matter of time until she wins a Grand Slam title. Why not now? Cliff Drysdale: Swiatek is the top choice. Her pluses are obvious, but her negative is that she does not have an overpowering serve, so she has to win the old-fashioned way and earn it. Big hitters on a good day could spell trouble. Mary Joe Fernandez: Swiatek is the favorite and the one to beat. She has won so much in the past 12 months, including winning two of the past three Slams. She moves exceptionally well and hits a very heavy and powerful ball. It will take a big hitter to upset her.

CHANG: OK. So tell us, who is CNN's new CEO and chairman Chris Licht, and how does he want to reshape CNN exactly? FOLKENFLIK: Sure. Chris Licht came over after stints at CBS where he oversaw the Colbert \"Late Show.\" And he had also been at CBS News, and before that, MSNBC. He's promising in this incarnation at CNN that he's going to make the channel less opinion driven, less perhaps focused on Donald Trump as the one true story that they really rode during the Trump era.

Discovery is expected to move deliberately rather than quickly in its search for a new CEO for CNN. Executives are telling staffers and TV agents that it will likely take a few months to fill the role that Chris Licht held for one turbulent year. Licht, the TV news veteran and \u201cLate Show With Stephen Colbert\u201d showrunner, was ousted last week after spearheading a series of programming moves and talent decisions that kept headlines about CNN circulating more often than anything else produced by the newsroom. Licht\u2019s final error was taking part in a profile The Atlantic published June 2 \u2014 15,000 words detailing a \u201cMeltdown at CNN.\u201d Numerous statements from Licht in the story and his questionable judgment in allowing a reporter such broad access marked the last straw for his corporate managers as well as CNN insiders.

In the wake of The Atlantic article, Licht attempted to regain his footing. He apologized to staffers and vowed to \u201cfight like hell\u201d to win over the trust of employees.           But it became increasingly clear that Licht\u2019s tenure as the chief executive was not tenable and quickly coming to an end. High-profile anchors and correspondents, in addition the the rank-and-file staff, had hit the wall with Licht. The CNN chief had, in effect, lost the room.           The picture quickly became clear to Zaslav, who installed his top lieutenant, David Leavy, as CNN\u2019s chief operating officer last week. Over the weekend, after The Atlantic story crystallized concerns that Zaslav had with Licht\u2019s leadership over the last several months, the Warner Bros. Discovery chief started seriously considering relieving him of his duties, a person familiar with the matter said. It had become evident that Licht, suffering from a series of self-inflicted wounds, could no longer lead the company.

In a push to improve its cloud security business, the company recently acquired security startup KryptCo and Israeli cyber security firm ChameleonX. Total quarterly revenue rose 8.2% to $772.1 million, beating analysts\u2019 average estimate of $749.3 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Michael Green, who wrote Blade Runner 2042, is penning the script. But how is the film coming along and what do the key creatives have in store? Lawrence said in an interview with Collider that the BioShock video game series is both visually and thematically appealing, which makes it a natural fit for a film. \"There's real ideas and philosophies underneath the game property, and it's really, really, really thought out. A lot of games may have a great world of some kind, or they may have a great lead character, or they may tee you up for great set-pieces, but they don't really have the ideas, they don't have the kind of weight and the gravitas that Bioshock does,\" Lawrence said.

The 2022 World Cup came to an end Sunday, with Argentina as the victors. Argentina started strong in the final match with a 2-0 lead over France, but France's Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 quickly changed the course of the game with two goals of his own in the second half. With minutes left, Argentina's star player Lionel Messi broke the tie and scored another goal, and it seemed like Argentina once again had sealed their victory \u2014 until Mbapp\u00e9, for only the second time in the history of the World Cup finals, completed a hat trick, scoring a third goal with a late penalty. After a tense penalty shootout, Argentina emerged victorious. Argentina's goalkeeper, Emiliano Mart\u00ednez, blocked France's second attempt, and French winger Kingsley Coman missed his penalty.","Jaccard Noise_60":1.0,"Cosine Noise_60":1.0,"EM Noise_60":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_60":1,"Noise_80 Predicted Answer":"France's","Noise_80 Document Index":"6","Noise_80 Document":"ifa.com\/fifaplus\/en\/tournaments\/mens\/worldcup\/qatar2022","Jaccard Noise_80":0.0,"Cosine Noise_80":0.3285191655,"EM Noise_80":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":0,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"France v Morocco","Noise_100 Document Index":"2","Noise_100 Document":"Dec 14, 2022 ...

In rather tedious news, Tencent and Sony Interactive Entertainment have acquired partial stakes in FromSoftware. More specifically, Tencent has 16.25% of shares and Sony Interactive Entertainment has 14.09% of shares in FromSoftware. The reason why this is boring is that Kadokawa is still the main owner (with 69.66% of the shares) and these new share acquisitions are both non-controlling stakes. In short, nothing has changed and neither Tencent nor Sony have any real decision-making power here. So if you were thinking that Sony would be able to force platform exclusivity for all future FromSoftware titles, then you would be wrong. This will just be business as usual, except that FromSoftware may have some more capital to play around with. One potentially interesting point here is that the money accrued from this will help FromSoftware bolster its publishing plans for the future. This is noteworthy because FromSoftware actually publishes its own games in Japan, so moving that to be more of a global endeavor would be better for all concerned. In that, in the past many of FromSoftware\u2019s games were released internationally by publishers that neither cared nor understood their games. The results were that FromSoftware\u2019s games were given no real international PR or marketing, and the localizations of these games were often thoroughly terrible as well.","Jaccard Noise_80":0.25,"Cosine Noise_80":0.5630176067,"EM Noise_80":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":1,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"Kadokawa","Noise_100 Document Index":"1","Noise_100 Document":"Aug 31, 2022 ...

Why didn\u2019t \u201cThe Voice\u201d air in the spring? Network executive Frances Berwick revealed to Deadline in May 2021, \u201cWe want to eventize this iconic series. We think \u2018The Voice\u2019 will be on NBC for a very long time to come and we believe the best way to protect the brand, while also super serving fans, is to produce one amazing cycle this year.\u201d Most other reality TV shows already follow this once-per-year format, including \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d on ABC, which airs every spring and will thus no longer face direct competition from \u201cThe Voice.\u201d             \u201cThe Voice\u201d coaches On May 15, NBC announced that new coach Camila Cabello would be replacing Kelly Clarkson on the judges\u2019 panel for Season 22, as Clarkson takes some time for herself.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":1.0,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Camila Cabello","Noise_20 Document Index":"4","Noise_20 Document":"In a new preview clip released in August, the \"God Gave Me You\" singer looks like he'll be going toe-to-toe with new coach Camila Cabello During the first glimpse of their chemistry, Blake got a lesson on the way he pronounces the \"Bam Bam\" songstress' name.  \"You pronounce my name wrong,\" she tells the country musician in the 30-second spot. \"He calls me Camelot, Carmichael.

When a team of US Marshals went to Francis\u2019 house on Sunday, Castillo said, the only thing they found was the ankle bracelet he had cut off and left in a portable cooler.           Neighbors told the US Marshals that they had recently seen several U-Haul trucks at Francis\u2019 house, according to Castillo.           \u201cIt appears he has been planning this for a while,\u201d he told CNN.

When it\u2019s tilted and you have to run uphill from the start, it becomes even more difficult. Also, Tiafoe serves so hard, and he has given opponents so few opportunities to break him, that when a set is tight late he has a real advantage because he can win so many easy points.

Along for the ride is another batch of reviews, highlighting the eclectic energy that film festivals provide. This time in my report I\u2019ve got a true-crime podcast satire, a beautiful rumination on love, and a dramatic thriller about doppelg\u00e4ngers. Let\u2019s begin. Despite this being a satire (and a very effective one -for three acts at least) this is also a film steeped in loneliness.\u00a0Susie Searches\u00a0plays on our societal love for true crime, and our unabashed quest for fame. With some bitingly funny moments and clever surprises along the way, its combination of genres and tones makes for a promising and snappy debut feature from Sophie Kargman.College student Susie Wallis (Kiersey Clemons) has her own true crime podcast, but it\u2019s not getting the traction she\u2019s hoping for. This doesn\u2019t affect her determination and Susie is persistent in making a name for herself. In a world of fans, how can you stand out?","Jaccard Noise_80":1.0,"Cosine Noise_80":0.9328954816,"EM Noise_80":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":1,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"(Ken Marino)","Noise_100 Document Index":"7","Noise_100 Document":"Susie\u2019s choices ignite a domino effect of darkly comic consequences that threaten to consume her soul if there\u2019s enough of one left to save once she sells it for the allure of national publicity. She\u2019s not alone either. The president of her college (Geoffrey Owens) loves the exposure and becomes her de facto publicist to get as much press (\u201cdon\u2019t forget to mention our ranking\u201d) as possible. While the new fame (she does find Jesse) makes it so she\u2019s suddenly the most visible person in town, however, not everyone is fully sold. It becomes a game of opportunists and skeptics. While Andrews and Susie\u2019s boss Edgar Cabot (Ken Marino) love that her expanded profile expands theirs too, others are less excited. When Jillian gains nothing she doubles down with the ridicule to remind Susie she\u2019s still the socially inept ghost from before. She\u2019s still her social inferior. Sheriff Loggins may appear bumbling, but he knows something isn\u2019t quite right once his sleepy town gets mired in a sudden spate of tragedies. And what about Jessie? Here\u2019s a guy who already had organic fame. Now its expanded because of his trauma rather than his air-headed charm. Things start feeling exploitative rather than educational. His story was supposed to help save lives, not be wielded for clout (Wolff is very good here).","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.3097854257,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

The multi-time NASCAR Cup Series champion will join Richard Childress Racing in 2023, according to a report from Jordan Bianchi of The Athletic. The move ends a successful 15-year tenure with Joe Gibbs Racing. An official announcement is expected Tuesday, per the report. The news punctuates an eventful and \u201cstressful\u201d regular season for Busch, whose free agency dominated headlines and clouded a playoff-caliber season in 2022. It did so because his looming free agency revealed a strange reality in NASCAR economics \u2014 that one of the sport\u2019s biggest stars would have to struggle to find a home (even with taking a pay cut) because of something outside of his control. That \u201csomething\u201d outside of his control, in this case, was the result of the Mars Inc. decision to exit NASCAR at the end of the year, leaving Joe Gibbs Racing (Busch\u2019s current team) without a primary sponsor for Busch\u2019s No. 18 team. Busch confirmed to reporters earlier this month that he had \u201cmore than one\u201d team extend official contract offers to him. RCR was among those companies, per reports at the time. He also said that his uncertain future had been weighing on him. \u201cIt weighs on you every time, every day of the week,\u201d Busch said at NASCAR\u2019s playoff media day before the race at Darlington.","Jaccard Noise_40":1.0,"Cosine Noise_40":1.0000001192,"EM Noise_40":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":1,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"Richard Childress Racing,","Noise_60 Document Index":"6","Noise_60 Document":"Kyle Busch, driver of the No. 18 M&M's Thank You Fans!

Image courtesy HBO Max Titans season 4 introduced us to Lex Luthor. Who plays the legendary DC character on the HBO Max series? One of the frontrunners of playing all things nefarious and intimidating when it comes to onscreen portrayals of villains, Titus Welliver is now the next Lex Luthor on the small screen for Titans season 4. You might have just figured this out by watching the season 4 premiere, which is aptly titled \u201cLex Luthor\u201d, but it was actually announced back in September during a preview on EW. As stated by the showrunner, Greg Walker, bringing Welliver on board to portray the Man of Steel\u2019s deadliest foe Lex Luthor was seemingly a less arduous task than you might think as he was already a fan of the source material. He expressed his inner geek as a comic book fan. The\u00a0Titans show boss stated: \u201c[W]hen I called to lure him in, I could barely get a word in. We were talking on the phone and he was just walking through his library, telling me about all his Wolfman\/Perez Titans\u00a0editions.\u201d As revealed in the first teaser that premiered at this year\u2019s New York Comic-Con, which is by far the darkest yet, this version of Lex has seemingly gained supernatural powers. Not only that, but he is conspiring with Potente\u2019s Mother Mayhem.","Jaccard Noise_80":0.5,"Cosine Noise_80":0.5952880383,"EM Noise_80":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":0,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"Welliver","Noise_100 Document Index":"5","Noise_100 Document":"He also played memorable antagonists in Sons of Anarchy and Lost and appeared in The Mandalorian and Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Welliver also happens to be a huge comic book fan and didn\u2019t take much convincing to join Titans, showrunner Greg Walker said. \"You usually have to do this whole dog-and-pony show to get an actor to do the show. But when I called to kind of lure him in, I could barely get a word in. We were talking on the phone and he was just walking through his library, telling me about all his Wolfman\/Perez Titans editions. He's a giant, giant fan. He'd watched every episode of the show, and could tell me about certain stories, certain shots. It was the most unexpected call I've ever had.\" As for the character itself, Walker promised a comic-accurate portrayal. Luthor is one of the most menacing and cunning villains ever, having bested Superman several times using nothing but his wits. Titans will stay true to Luthor\u2019s comic persona. \"He has a very sensitive, thoughtful approach to evil and power. You know what he's done, what he's capable of doing, except like many of those people, he's personable. He doesn't have a cat on his lap. Yeah. He's curious, which I think is very interesting about his character.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.5,"Cosine Noise_100":0.5952880383,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

They blame migrants,\u201d Waiz told ABC News. As of August, Italy\u2019s unemployment rate stood at 8.1%, the third highest in the European Union after Spain and Greece. Clamping down on immigration was a key part of Meloni\u2019s campaign. Though she softened her rhetoric before the election, Meloni pledged stricter border controls and proposed establishing European Union-managed centers to analyze asylum applications. There are about 5 million foreign-born residents in Italy, making up less than 9% of the country\u2019s total population of 59.2 million, according to the country\u2019s most recent census data.","Jaccard Noise_60":1.0,"Cosine Noise_60":0.9930071235,"EM Noise_60":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_60":1,"Noise_80 Predicted Answer":"Meloni","Noise_80 Document Index":"4","Noise_80 Document":"The possibility of Meloni becoming the first woman to become Prime Minister of Italy had been widely discussed both prior to and after the 2022 Italian general election.

Let\u2019s face it, the Pixel Watch 2 isn\u2019t going to land until the latter half of 2023 at the earliest. The first-gen Pixel Watch is barely six months old, and Google has yet to even confirm whether it\u2019ll see annual updates like its Pixel smartphones. With Apple and Samsung both ploughing on with new models every twelve months, though, it\u2019s a safe bet that Google will follow suit.

Going forward, Nvidia will have to balance its drive to sell more cards with sensitivity to customers who have been eagerly awaiting the chance to buy a new GPU at a reasonable price. While the $1,599 price tag on the new 4090 is anything but, the other cards in Nvidia's new 40-series should be significantly cheaper.

This GPU is currently among the most powerful on the market, and if you want to play the latest games at the highest framerates, you'll need the best gaming PCs packing high-octane cards like this one. Presently, the GeForce RTX 4090 is the top-of-the-line card in Nvidia's 40-series of GeForce RTX GPUs, which were officially announced in September 2022. The Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 and 4090 were unveiled during Nvidia's September 2022 GTC keynote. Together, they've established a new high-water mark for what we can expect from consumer-grade graphics cards. At that Nvidia event, we learned when these cards are coming out, how much they'll cost, and what kind of power we ought to expect from them. The Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 is the cream of the crop \u2014 here's everything you need to know about it. The Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 went on sale on October 12, 2022. The card has a starting price of $1,599. That's roughly as much as the rest of the PC you'll put it in will cost, so start saving now!","Jaccard Noise_20":1.0,"Cosine Noise_20":0.5698207021,"EM Noise_20":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":1,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"$1,599","Noise_40 Document Index":"4","Noise_40 Document":"Following months of anticipation and controversy among its add-in board partners, NVIDIA's 40 series GPUs are finally here. The company unveiled the GeForce RTX 4090 and GeForce RTX 4080 today at its GTC 2022 keynote. Taking full advantage of its new \"Ada Lovelace\" architecture, NVIDIA says the two GPUs offer significantly better ray tracing performance. The company worked with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) to co-develop a new \"4N\" fabrication process that NVIDIA says is up to two times more power efficient than the 8nm process it used for its 30 Series cards.\u00a0 Ray tracing performance is significantly improved thanks to Ada Lovelace featuring NVIDIA's new third-generation RT Cores, and the inclusion of a new rendering technique called Shader Execution Reordering and DLSS 3.0. In some games, NVIDIA said you can expect two to three times better ray tracing performance than what was possible with its Ampere GPUs. The company demoed Cyberpunk 2077 running at a near consistent 100 frames per second with all of the game's ray tracing features set to max. NVIDIA said rasterization performance is up to two times faster thanks to the new architecture.\u00a0\u00a0 The first of NVIDIA's new Ada Lovelace GPUs will arrive next month when the GeForce RTX 4090 goes on for sale for $1,599 on October 12th.","Jaccard Noise_40":1.0,"Cosine Noise_40":0.6602807045,"EM Noise_40":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":1,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"$1,600,","Noise_60 Document Index":"2","Noise_60 Document":"It\u2019s barely worth it to resell these cards right now, and with only 281 GPUs sold in 3 weeks, the demand is scarce.

Going forward, Nvidia will have to balance its drive to sell more cards with sensitivity to customers who have been eagerly awaiting the chance to buy a new GPU at a reasonable price. While the $1,599 price tag on the new 4090 is anything but, the other cards in Nvidia's new 40-series should be significantly cheaper. Hopefully, the company can do something to discourage scalpers and ensure more fans have a shot at buying one of these new cards at a fair price.

Two Pixel-branded smartwatches had been in development at Google by July 2016, but they were canceled ahead of their release due to hardware chief Rick Osterloh's concerns that they did not fit well with other Pixel devices.

I was hoping that for Google's first integration with Fitbit software, there would be some new technology or that the device would be more affordable. Also, fall detection isn't going to be immediately available on the Pixel Watch. Google says it's coming this winter. That's disappointing, given it's already available on other smartwatches. The Pixel 7 and 7 Pro have a few nice updates, especially to the camera. The coolest feature is photo unblur, which, thanks to Google's new Tensor 2 chip, allows you to take any blurry photo and clear it up. Even better, you can unblur any photo, not just those you've taken on the Pixel phone. I tried it on a blurry photo of my husband and me.

It is the ninth installment in the series, the ninth chronologically, and the sequel to 2018's God of War. Loosely based on Norse mythology, the game is set in ancient Scandinavia and features series protagonist, Kratos, and his now teenage son, Atreus. Concluding the Norse era of the series, the game covers Ragnar\u00f6k, the eschatological event which is central to Norse mythology and was foretold to happen in the previous game after Kratos killed the Aesir god Baldur.  The gameplay is similar to the previous 2018 installment. It features combo-based combat, as well as puzzle and role-playing elements. The gameplay has been revamped from the previous game: in addition to Kratos' main weapons, a magical battle axe and his double-chained blades, he also acquires a magical spear and his shield has become more versatile, with different types of shields that have differing offensive and defensive abilities. His son Atreus, as well as some other characters, provide assistance in combat and can be passively controlled.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.6666666667,"Cosine Noise_0":0.7569320798,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"November 9, 2022,","Noise_20 Document Index":"5","Noise_20 Document":"God of War Ragnar\u00f6k was released worldwide on November 9, 2022, for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.

Here's what you need to know about him. He lost to Liz Truss in September, but she resigned six weeks later. In the latest leadership contest, Mr Sunak racked up the support of his fellow MPs early, and fast. He crossed the 100 nominations he needed long before the deadline - including from MPs that had previously backed Truss or Boris Johnson. He clashed with the former PM during the previous leadership race, claiming her plan to borrow money during an inflation crisis was a \"fairytale\" that would plunge the economy into chaos. His parents came to the UK from east Africa and are both of Indian origin. Mr Sunak was born in Southampton in 1980, where his father was a GP and his mother ran a pharmacy. He went to the boarding school Winchester College, then studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Oxford, and business at Stanford in America. He is now the first British Asian prime minister. Mr Sunak was first elected as an MP in 2015 - for Richmond in north Yorkshire - but rose quickly, and was made finance minister - or chancellor - in February 2020 under Boris Johnson.

(Oct. 25) LONDON (AP) \u2014 Rishi Sunak became Britain\u2019s third prime minister this year on Tuesday, tasked with taming an economic crisis that has left the country\u2019s finances in a precarious state and millions struggling to pay their food and energy bills. Sunak, who is the U.K.\u2019s first leader of color, met King Charles III at Buckingham Palace, where the monarch officially asked the new leader of the governing Conservative Party to form a government, as is tradition. Sunak clinched the leadership position Monday, seen by his party as a safe pair of hands to stabilize an economy sliding toward recession \u2014 and stem its own plunging popularity, after the brief, disastrous term of Liz Truss.  Her package of unfunded tax cuts spooked financial markets with the prospect of ballooning debt, drove the pound to record lows and forced the Bank of England to intervene \u2014 weakening Britain\u2019s fragile economy and obliterating Truss\u2019 authority within her party. In one of his first acts, Sunak announced he would retain Treasury chief Jeremy Hunt, appointed by Truss to steady the markets two weeks ago amid the turmoil. His removal would have set off new tremors.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.4391959906,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}
{"Query":"How much does the Netflix Basic with Ads subscription cost?","Correct Answer":["6.99"],"Noise_0 Predicted Answer":"$6.99 per month,","Noise_0 Document Index":"9","Noise_0 Document":"Related Stories Move over \"Stranger Things,\" the next big Netflix hit may just be commercials. The streaming giant on Thursday is rolling out its cheapest membership tier, dubbed \"Basic With Ads.\" The new tier will cost $6.99 per month, which makes it a full $3 cheaper than Netflix's current cheapest plan, the $9.99 Basic plan. It's Netflix's first foray into the ad-supported space \u2014 the streamer has for years resisted putting any advertising on its platform. The company's plan arrives on Nov. 3, a month before rival streaming service Disney+ will introduce its own ad-supported tier, and competes with ad-supported plans from services like Hulu and Peacock. The plan's launch comes as Netflix is preparing to crack down on password sharing on its platform. Beginning next year, Netflix will push people who borrow accounts to create their own, and will also give account-holders who share their passwords the ability to pay extra to have friends and family on their accounts. Here's what you need to know about Netflix's Basic With Ads tier. The Basic With Ads plan will operate similarly to the Basic plan. Users will have access to a 720p video stream \u2014 versus the 1080p stream offered by the $15.49 Standard plan and the 4K plan offered by the $19.99 Premium plan \u2014 which can be accessed from any internet-connected device.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.3333333333,"Cosine Noise_0":0.5856238008,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"$6.99 per month,","Noise_20 Document Index":"0","Noise_20 Document":"Nov 3, 2022 ...

The era of huge budgets and endless hubris came to an end as the rent came due all at once. In spring and summer, Netflix, the leader in the space, hemorrhaged users for the first time in ten years, prompting a stock swoon, a swath of layoffs, and a moratorium on the blank checks the company used to dole out to Hollywood needle movers. (Sorry, Bright 2, we hardly knew you.) Plenty of analysts have tried to evaluate exactly what went wrong, and most lay the blame on a combination of a middling slate of original programming and a newfound national stinginess in the face of rising inflation. Thankfully, Netflix has humbled itself to address at least one of those issues with a new payment plan it put into action this autumn. For a teensy $6.99 per month, anyone can pay for a Netflix subscription \u2026 as long as they\u2019re willing to sit through a few commercials during playback. The plan is called Basic With Ads, and the $6.99 figure is much more aligned with consumer expectations compared with the bloated premium $20 subscription \u2014 which I discovered I was still somehow paying for over the course of reporting this story.

Between Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery, White Noise, and Triangle of Sadness, we got a ton of great content that forced the upper class to have traumatic vacations. The pinnacle of this was the second season of The White Lotus, which moved the miniseries to a luxurious new location in Italy. Unfortunately for the characters, this had more in common with the Italian scenery of The Talented Mr. Ripley than it did with Under The Tuscan Sun. As with the first season, the end of this trip is teased at the very beginning, and it\u2019s a violent one. Both seasons of The White Lotus take place at individual locations in a luxury vacation resort chain. A multitude of guests (most of whom are incredibly wealthy) interact with the staff and local residents, only to begin squabbling and bringing up past issues. While the show\u2019s brilliance stems from the inventive storytelling of writer\/director Mike White, it doesn\u2019t hurt that the show has the budget and scale of an HBO production. In order to make the series as authentic as possible, White and his production team utilized several real locations in both seasons. The White Lotus has drawn critical acclaim due to how close its satire feels to reality, and the believability extends to the filming locations themselves.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.5295194387,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

The Republican midterm flameout is now official. Democrats have retained control of the US Senate, which will pave the way for Joe Biden to spend two more years filling the federal courts with his nominees and staffing his administration largely the way he sees fit. The Georgia Senate run-off is no longer a pivotal contest to determine control of the chamber, although a victory for Democrats there would make holding the majority in two years easier, when the party will have more at-risk seats to defend. There is still a likelihood, although not certainty, that the Republicans will control a slim majority in the House of Representatives, bringing a variety of headaches for the president. His legislative agenda is dead, and more aggressive Republican oversight is in store, but even that has a silver lining - if his political opponents are unable to effectively govern due to internal discord. The consequences of this history-defying midterm election result are still being revealed. Donald Trump's political future has been damaged, although how enduringly remains to be seen. Joe Biden's standing within his party has been bolstered. The political world in the US looks considerably different than it did just a week ago. The midterm elections are for Congress, which is made up of two parts - the House of Representatives and the Senate.

The results amount to the best midterm performance for a sitting party in 20 years. US President Joe Biden said he was incredibly pleased, and it was time for Republicans to decide \"who they are\". Democratic Senate Majority leader, Chuck Schumer, said the results showed the American people had rejected what he called the \"violent rhetoric\" of the Republican Party.

Super PACS and political party groups were spending money almost exclusively in districts that President Biden won in 2020, indicating that Democrats were in a defensive crouch. Midterm elections often benefit the opposition political party at the expense of the White House\u2019s party. 1994 and 2010 were typical midterm elections, where Republicans made gains in the House at the midpoint of Bill Clinton and Barack Obama\u2019s first terms. Similarly, in 2018, Republican\u2019s got crushed in House elections but picked up two seats in the Senate. If a president\u2019s approval ratings are high, then the presiding party typically fares better in midterm House elections. For example, in 1998, Bill Clinton\u2019s approval rating was 66%, and Democrats retained control of the House. In 2002, George W. Bush polled at a 63%, and Republicans made gains. Currently, Biden\u2019s approval rating is 42%, which is similar to former president Barack Obama\u2019s rating in 2010.

Released as a single on 10 April 1989, the song is the band's highest-charting single in their home country, reaching number five on the UK Singles Chart. It additionally reached number three in West Germany and Ireland while becoming a top-10 hit in several other European countries and New Zealand. The music video, directed by Tim Pope, won the British Video of the Year at the 1990 Brit Awards.  The meaning of \"Lullaby\" has been speculated by fans, including as a metonymy for addiction, depression, or sexual assault,[2] and Smith has offered multiple explanations as to its theme or content, such as childhood nightmares or abuse.[2] One explanation by Smith follows that the song is about the disturbing songs his father sung to him as a kid, and the horrible ending they would always have.[3] Tim Pope, a long-time collaborator of the Cure on many of its music videos, interprets \"Lullaby\" as an allegory for lead singer Robert Smith's drug-addled past.[4]  Upon its release, \"Lullaby\" became the Cure's highest-charting hit in their home country when it reached number five on the UK Singles Chart. It remains their only single to reach the top five in the United Kingdom.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.3490861356,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

But it comes as no surprise that Oscar-nominated actress Margot Robbie has stepped up to play the iconic character, and has joined forces with some very familiar faces to bring the narrative alive.  Here's everything you need to know about the Barbie film: Director and former ELLE UK cover star Greta Gerwig has penned the script with Marriage Story's Noah Baumbach. While the Barbie plot remains mostly under wraps, we do know that the film will see Ryan Gosling's, who plays Ken in the film, wanting to go on a summer adventure with Robbie's Barbie as they navigate a blossoming romance. Other than that, we're not entirely sure what to expect from the film's plot.

He was detached and arrogant. He could not lead or build consensus. He was the absolute opposite of what a CEO in any big company must be. The NCAA Board of Governors can't make the same mistake again.  The presidential model hasn't worked. That said, it could.

Right now, the NCAA does one thing really well -- putting on its basketball tournaments. Gavitt runs those events tournament. He has the demeanor and the mutual respect to inject some credibility back into the president's office. Yes, he is in Emmert's inner circle, but he has thrived on his own despite that link.

The company has also faced criticism for its handling of the situation and the toxic work environment that allegedly exists within the company. This has resulted in significant public backlash, with some fans and employees calling for boycotts and protests. Alegre\u2019s departure from Activision to Yuga Labs may be seen as a positive move for those who are critical of Activision\u2019s leadership and culture. It\u2019s worth noting that the gaming industry and the NFT space have both been the subject of intense scrutiny and controversy in recent years. The allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination at Activision Blizzard have been a particularly significant source of controversy in the gaming industry. Meanwhile, the NFT space has faced criticism for its environmental impact and the high levels of speculation and price volatility surrounding some NFTs. Furthermore, the recent fake news surrounding Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) highlights the need for responsible and informed reporting in the NFT space. Given these issues, the appointment of Alegre as Yuga Labs\u2019 CEO marks an interesting new phase for the company.

View all partners In winning the 2023 Academy Award for best animated feature, director Guillermo del Toro\u2019s Pinocchio continues its remarkable run of accolades, from the Golden Globes to the Baftas. Del Toro has used the platform afforded by his nominations to champion the medium of animation as true cinema, proclaiming in his Bafta award speech:  Animation is not a genre for kids. It\u2019s a medium for art, it\u2019s a medium for film and I think animation should stay in the conversation. His rendition of Pinocchio has certainly started a conversation, not least in gaining an impressive audience on Netflix. His film demonstrates that in the right creative environment \u2013 and with an innovator at the helm \u2013 a well-worn narrative, such as Pinocchio, can evolve. Such revitalisation of the Pinocchio story was in part possible because \u2013 as he says himself \u2013 del Toro didn\u2019t craft his retelling solely with children in mind.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.25,"Cosine Noise_100":0.738961339,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

The increase in real GDP reflected increases in private inventory investment, consumer spending, federal government spending, state and local government spending, and nonresidential fixed investment that were partly offset by decreases in residential fixed investment and exports. Imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, decreased (table 2). The increase in private inventory investment was led by manufacturing (mainly petroleum and coal products as well as chemicals) as well as mining, utilities, and construction industries (led by utilities). The increase in consumer spending reflected increases in both services and goods. Within services, the increase was led by health care, housing and utilities, and \"other\" services (notably, personal care services). Within goods, the leading contributor was motor vehicles and parts.","Jaccard Noise_40":0.0,"Cosine Noise_40":0.4742159247,"EM Noise_40":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":0,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"0.4\u00a0percent","Noise_60 Document Index":"3","Noise_60 Document":"4\u00a0percent of GDP in 2022, the result of offsetting changes in some of those smaller revenue sources.

Freddy Freeman is Billy's physically disabled foster brother and also the first person to learn that Billy has superpowers. Freddy is an expert on all things superheroes and helps Billy learn more about his powers. Freddy Freeman's adult form, formerly known as Captain Marvel Jr. in the comics, wears a blue super suit and has a great deal of flight power, which is fitting because that was the superpower he told Billy he wished he could have.

Digital illustration is only one example of how artificial intelligence is being used in the arts. A lot of AI-generated screenplays and storylines have also been produced, which might endanger authors in the future.   The bizarre brand-new program has been streaming on Twitch since the middle of December of last year. It goes by the name of Nothing, Forever and airs constantly. It is an AI-generated parody of Seinfeld. The blocky, low-resolution visuals are evocative of computer games from the 1980s. Because they are AI, the \"jokes\" are absurd and unpredictable. A month and a half into its run, it went too far on Sunday when its Jerry turned transphobic.

As of Friday, the Iowa Department of Education says it has received 15,538 applications for an Educational Savings Account, or ESA, to provide state funding for a student to attend a private K-12 school. A Legislative Services Agency analysis projected 14,068 would enroll in the first year of the program. The application period runs through June 30th, meaning the number of applications will likely continue to grow. If all of those applications are approved, the taxpayer cost for the program would likely exceed the $107 million dollars estimate for this coming school year. It would also likely mean a larger-than-expected loss in funding to public schools due to students enrolling instead in a private institution. State funding to public schools is based on enrollment, so fewer enrolled students would mean less funding from the state. Governor Reynolds\u2019 voucher program aimed to offset at least some of that by giving districts $1,176 per student who lives in a district and enrolls in a private school. The state declined to provide demographic data on the applications so far, citing the ongoing application period. That means it\u2019s unclear yet how many of the applications are from public school students.","Jaccard Noise_80":0.0,"Cosine Noise_80":0.5026684999,"EM Noise_80":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":0,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"9 million","Noise_100 Document Index":"7","Noise_100 Document":"\"It truly is about giving every student the best opportunity to find their place in the world and a foundation for success in the future.\" Signing the bill into law sets up a crash course for the Iowa Department of Education, the agency tasked with getting the program up and running. Families that want to receive an ESA for next fall must apply to receive a state-funded account by the end of June. The department will put up a link Tuesday, Reynolds said, for families to sign up for updates on how to request a state-funded account. Also, a request for bids will go out to find a private contractor to administer the program. ESA plan passes after marathon debate Iowa's new school choice law (HF 68) passed in the House after more than eight hours of debate by a vote of 55-45 with nine Republicans joining all House Democrats voting against it. The Senate followed after midnight, advancing the bill to the governor\u2019s desk by a vote of 31-18. Three Republican senators voted with Democrats against the bill. Rep. John Wills, R-Spirit Lake, does not expect a large migration of students from public to private schools, but said the state should support parents who want to make that switch. \u201cThis bill is about putting parents in charge of their students\u2019 education,\u201d Wills said. \u201cThis bill is about making sure that parents have the ability to determine where their children go to school rather than where their ZIP code is.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.5055671334,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

Indeed, they\u2019re not far off being overtaken by merchandising and licensing (up 49.5% to 114.7bn KRW) and \u2018contents\u2019 (up 22.9% to 107.2bn KRW).

The company, which a Nevada filing indicates was incorporated last month, currently has Musk as its director and Jared Birchall, the director of Musk\u2019s family office, listed as its secretary. The filing, which The Verge has also obtained, indicates that Musk incorporated the business on March 9th, 2023. Rumors about Musk starting up an AI company have been floating around for days, with a report from Business Insider revealing that Musk had purchased thousands of graphic processing units (GPUs) to power an upcoming generative AI product. The Financial Times similarly reported that Musk planned to create an AI firm to compete with the Microsoft-backed OpenAI. Musk even reportedly sought funding from SpaceX and Tesla investors to get the company started. During an interview on Twitter Spaces, when Musk was asked about all the GPUs he purchased, the billionaire made no mention of his plans to build an AI company, stating \u201cit seems like everyone and their dog is buying GPUs at this point.\u201d The purported X.AI name matches the branding of the X Corp. name he has since assigned to Twitter, along with the \u201cX\u201d label he\u2019s applied to his vision of an \u201ceverything app.","Jaccard Noise_20":1.0,"Cosine Noise_20":0.9864166379,"EM Noise_20":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":1,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"xAI,","Noise_40 Document Index":"5","Noise_40 Document":"Elon Musk launched an artificial intelligence company called xAI, but beyond that revealed almost nothing about what the company will actually do.

Twitter announced this week it was partnering with eToro to allow users to be able to trade stocks and crypto. It should be pretty clear by now that Musk\u2019s call for a six-month pause was purely out of self interest in the AI arms race, as I wrote at the time. ChatGPT has become a fascinating tool for people who want to experiment with large language models (LLMs) that answer questions posed in natural language. But there are still a lot of kinks to be worked out, as ChatGPT will often give confident answers, even when it\u2019s wrong.

But it\u2019s an interesting magic trick and it\u2019s something that will improved upon as more people in the world of tech become involved.

The protagonist of Fallen Order and Survivor, Cal Kestis has become a beloved character in the overall Star Wars series - not just his Jedi series. While he was young and learning in Fallen Order, Survivor introduces to us a more experienced and grown-up Cal. However, this doesn't mean things are easy. Throughout the story of Jedi: Survivor, we see Cal struggling with the things that have happened in the past. And with betrayal, loss, and growing hatred, he begins to embrace the dark side that he has been feeling. By the end of the game, he shoots Bode down, even after Bode is defenseless. In the final moments of the game, we see Cal reflecting on this darkness, but it is not yet resolved.","Jaccard Noise_40":1.0,"Cosine Noise_40":1.0,"EM Noise_40":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":1,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"Cal","Noise_60 Document Index":"3","Noise_60 Document":"Posted in Guides  Want to get to know the Star Wars Jedi Survivor cast and characters?

Peele's use of humor in the 2017 movie also taught Manzoor something very important: \"I didn't realize how much you could use comedy to help keep the audience with you.\" Kill Bill is one of the many films to inspire the action sequences in Polite Society. There is a fight that takes place between Ria and her sister Lena, which is gritty and more grounded than some of the other bigger battle scenes in the movie. It take inspiration from the Bourne films and the Uma Thurman and Daryl Hannah brawl in Kill Bill.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.2147072852,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

Health and Safety Requirements A significant number of emergency waivers related to health and safety requirements will expire at the end of the PHE, which is expected to be on May 11, 2023. For example, during the PHE, the time frame to complete a medical record at discharge was extended because the large volume of patients being treated would result in the clinician being away from direct patient care for extended periods of time. Typically, a patient\u2019s medical records are required to be completed at discharge to ensure there are no gaps in patients\u2019 continuity of care.

Still, others will expire. Below is a list of some of the changes people will see in the months ahead. Certain Medicare and Medicaid waivers and broad flexibilities for health care providers are no longer necessary and will end. During the COVID-19 PHE, CMS has used a combination of emergency authority waivers, regulations, and sub-regulatory guidance to ensure and expand access to care and to give health care providers the flexibilities needed to help keep people safe. States, hospitals, nursing homes, and others are currently operating under hundreds of these waivers that affect care delivery and payment and that are integrated into patient care and provider systems. Many of these waivers and flexibilities were necessary to expand facility capacity for the health care system and to allow the health care system to weather the heightened strain created by COVID-19; given the current state of COVID-19, this excess capacity is no longer necessary. CMS developed a roadmap for the eventual end of the COVID-19 PHE, which was published in August 2022, and has been sharing information on what health care facilities and providers can do to prepare for future emergencies. This includes facilities returning to normal operations and meeting CMS requirements that promote the safety and quality of care they provide.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.5707503557,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

The previous CBA that ended the 2011 lockout instituted no immediate changes to the draft, but it called for a committee of owners and players to discuss further charges.  Players who were not automatically eligible had to declare their eligibility for the draft by notifying the NBA offices in writing no later than at least 60 days before the event. For the 2023 draft, the date fell on April 23. Under the CBA a player may withdraw his name from consideration from the draft at any time before the final declaration deadline, which usually falls 10 days before the draft at 5:00 pm EDT (2100 UTC). Under current NCAA rules, players usually have until 10 days after the draft combine to withdraw from the draft and retain college eligibility. They must have withdrawn on or before May 31, 22 days prior to this draft.[70]  A player who has hired an agent retains his remaining college eligibility regardless of whether he is drafted after an evaluation from the NBA Undergraduate Advisory Committee. Players who declare for the NBA draft and are not selected have the opportunity to return to their school for at least another year only after terminating all agreements with their agents, who must have been certified.[73]","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.777531743,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

Adi has covered video games, biohacking, and more for The Verge since 2011.  Apple has announced an augmented reality headset called Apple Vision Pro that \u201cseamlessly\u201d blends the real and digital world. \u201cIt\u2019s the first Apple product you look through, and not at,\u201d CEO Tim Cook said of the device, which looks like a pair of ski goggles. As rumored, it features a separate battery pack and is controlled with eyes, hands, and voice. It will start at $3,499 and launch early next year, starting in the US market with more countries coming later in the year. Vision Pro is positioned as primarily an AR device, but it can switch between augmented and full virtual reality using a dial.  The device is controller-free, and you browse rows of app icons in an operating system called visionOS by looking at them. You can tap to select and flick to scroll, you can also give voice commands, and Apple says \u201chundreds of thousands of familiar iPhone and iPad apps\u201d will automatically work that way. On top of that, the headset supports Bluetooth accessories, including Magic Keyboard and Magic Trackpad, and lets you connect your Mac to use inside the headset. Downward-facing cameras can capture your hands even if they\u2019re resting low on your body.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":1.0,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"$3,500","Noise_20 Document Index":"2","Noise_20 Document":"Apple is planning an in-store, appointment-only rollout of its flagship virtual reality headset Vision Pro, Bloomberg reported on Friday, underscoring the complexities behind the company\u2019s most consequential product launch in years as it faces manufacturing difficulties, high costs and a struggling effort to whip up mass-market appeal for what is mostly still a niche product. The Apple Vision Pro headset will reportedly be sold in Apple stores with a fitting appointment.  Apple will initially require customers to make an in-store appointment to buy the $3,500 Vision Pro so the headset can be fitted properly and customers can be taught how to use it, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. The headset is designed to wrap around the head and keep out light and the many variables involved in fitting the mask\u2014including multiple head straps, different sized light seals and optional prescription lenses\u2014necessitate the individualized approach, Bloomberg reported. Apple will sell the device at all of its U.S. stores, though the company will reportedly begin the rollout in larger areas like New York and Los Angeles early next year. Bloomberg reports that most stores will only have one or two demo devices due to limited supply and high cost of headsets. The Vision Pro will also go on sale online in its U.S. web store at some point in early 2024, Bloomberg reported, and the complexities of its sale mean the company does not expect to partner with third-party resellers until at least 2025.","Jaccard Noise_20":0.0,"Cosine Noise_20":0.8875223994,"EM Noise_20":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":0,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"$3,499","Noise_40 Document Index":"3","Noise_40 Document":"Jun 5, 2023 ...

You can even keep your hands in a natural position rather than holding them in front of you when making gestures. Glancing at a search bar and speaking will even allow you to type into the search bar for easy use. Aside from these new methods of controlling the mixed reality headset, there are two familiar features. First, Siri is back, giving you Apple's famous voice assistant right out of the box. Second, the headset does work with a range of Bluetooth products.
