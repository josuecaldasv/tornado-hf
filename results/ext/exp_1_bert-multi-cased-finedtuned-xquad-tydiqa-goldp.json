And, once again, Tesla has demonstrated its remarkable capabilities. Despite lower car prices, the company managed to mitigate the already-expected decline in margins, showcasing Elon Musk\u2019s adeptness at steering the company through both prosperous and challenging times. Another noteworthy aspect is the positive evolution of Tesla\u2019s revenue mix, which bodes well for H2 \u2013 when we expect further margin contraction in the car sales department. With improvements in revenue from Energy and Services, Tesla gains greater flexibility to continue its strategy of offering competitive prices and driving more sales. While it\u2019s true that Tesla\u2019s recent rally may have been excessive in the short term, the overall trajectory of the company remains positive. Thus, investors should exercise caution before betting against Tesla, as it continues to exceed expectations and enhance its long-term prospects.\u201d While other automakers delivered their worst sales figures in a decade, Tesla\u2019s delivery statistics were praiseworthy in 2022. The company delivered 1,313,851 vehicles to customers worldwide and, in so doing, increased its deliveries by 40% in comparison to the previous year. It also produced 47% more cars in 2022 compared to 2021.

These platforms removed Trump due to concerns around his public comments following the Capitol Hill riots in January 2021. Before getting himself banned from various social media platforms, Trump built up huge followings. So once these mainstream social media platforms dumped him, Trump announced his intention to build his own platform. So, what is Trump\u2019s social network about anyway?

Created by the Seattle Post-Intelligencer and renowned sports editor Royal Brougham, the show has honored some of the biggest names to play professional sports in the city.

The successes have continued off the field. Lockett received the 2021 Steve Largent Award, given annually to the team contributor who best exemplifies the spirit, dedication, and integrity of the Seahawks.

Both the Bengals and Rams trailed by double digits in the second half of their wins over the Chiefs and 49ers. They mounted comebacks and as a result, the Bengals will have a chance to win their first Super Bowl in franchise history in their first appearance since 1989. Meanwhile, the Rams will have a chance to avenge their loss against the Patriots in the big game just three years ago. As unpredictable as the playoffs have been, the Super Bowl broadcast, location and date are set in stone. Here's everything you need to know about the big game in 2022, including when Super Bowl 56 will be played.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.0725918859,"EM Noise_100":0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

Blaming Nato's expansion eastwards is a Russian narrative that has gained some ground in Europe. Before the war, President Putin demanded Nato turn the clock back to 1997 and remove its forces and military infrastructure from Central Europe, Eastern Europe and the Baltics. In his eyes, the West promised back in 1990 that Nato would expand \"not an inch to the east\", yet did so anyway. That was before the collapse of the Soviet Union, however, so the promise made to then Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev referred merely to East Germany in the context of a reunified Germany. Mr Gorbachev said later that \"the topic of Nato expansion was never discussed\" at the time. Nato maintains it never intended to deploy combat troops on its eastern flank, until Russia annexed Crimea illegally in 2014.

It was directed by Hidetaka Miyazaki with worldbuilding provided by fantasy writer George R. R. Martin. It was released for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X\/S on February 25 by FromSoftware in Japan and Bandai Namco Entertainment internationally. Players control a customizable player character who is on a quest to repair the Elden Ring and become the new Elden Lord.  Elden Ring is presented through a third-person perspective; players freely roam its interactive open world. The six main areas are traversed using the player character's steed Torrent as the primary mode of travel. Linear, hidden dungeons can be explored to find useful items. Players can use several types of weapons and magic spells, including non-direct engagement enabled by stealth mechanics. Throughout the game's world, checkpoints enable fast travel and allow players to improve their attributes using an in-game currency called Runes. Elden Ring has an online multiplayer mode in which players can join each other for cooperative and player-versus-player combat.  During planning, FromSoftware wanted to create an open-world game with gameplay similar to Dark Souls; the company wanted Elden Ring to act as an evolution of the self-titled debut of the series. Miyazaki admired the work of Martin, whose contributions he hoped would produce a more accessible narrative than those of the company's earlier games.","Jaccard Noise_60":1.0,"Cosine Noise_60":0.9999999404,"EM Noise_60":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_60":1,"Noise_80 Predicted Answer":"27 April 2016","Noise_80 Document Index":"3","Noise_80 Document":"Popular Games Latest game news Subscribe to our newsletter and keep up to date with our products and services.

This is the first time that Apple\u2019s not updating to a new processor for one of its flagship iPhones since the 2008 iPhone 3G, which featured virtually the same internals as the original iPhone. The iPhone 14 Pro, meanwhile, has an A16 processor, which the company says is more power efficient, even when doing intensive tasks. The raw specs of the new chip are similar, though \u2014 like the A15 in the regular 14, it has a six-core CPU, a five-core GPU, and a 16-core Neural Engine. The new version just has better cores, according to Apple.  The decision not to update the chipset for the standard iPhone 14 isn\u2019t exactly a surprising one. Analysts like Ming-Chi Kuo and reporters like Mark Gurman have been predicting the move for months, and the chip shortage isn\u2019t quite over yet.

Unlike with previous iPhone generations, the A16 will only be available in Apple's higher-end\u00a0iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max models. The more mainstream\u00a0iPhone 14 and 14 Plus\u00a0will make do with the\u00a0A15 chip that Apple debuted in 2021. Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. A reported Geekbench test result shows modest performance gains overall. In single threaded tasks, which depend on the speed of an individual CPU core to do one important job, performance rose a significant 10% from a score of 1,707 on the iPhone 13 Pro to 1,879 on the iPhone 14 Pro, according to a test result spotted by MacRumors.","Jaccard Noise_20":1.0,"Cosine Noise_20":0.9999999404,"EM Noise_20":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":1,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"A15","Noise_40 Document Index":"3","Noise_40 Document":"Apple is set to unveil the all-new iPhone 14 lineup this fall, bringing new features such as an always-on display and upgraded camera hardware. What about the iPhone 14 chip? As it turns out, things are going to be interesting this year. The iPhone 14 chip will be different than the iPhone 14 Pro chip for the first time. As a quick refresher, the iPhone 14 lineup is expected to consist of four different devices across two different screen sizes. The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro will feature a 6.1-inch display, while the iPhone 14 Max and iPhone 14 Pro Max will feature a 6.7-inch display.  This will mark the first time that Apple has offered a non-Pro version of the iPhone with a 6.7-inch display. But with that being said, there will be some key differences between the iPhone 14 models and the iPhone 14 Pro models. This includes the chip inside. Apple has traditionally upgraded the chip inside the iPhone every year. For instance, the iPhone 12 lineup was powered by the A14 chip, while the iPhone 13 lineup is powered by the A15 chip. That won\u2019t be the case this year with the iPhone 14 chip.

Directed by Ms Marvel directors Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah, the film was initially greenlit in 2021 as part of a wider move at Warner Bros to create feature films specifically for the streaming service HBO Max.

Batgirl was to have Keaton reprise his role as Batman, alongside Grace as the titular hero Barbara Gordon, JK Simmons as Barbara\u2019s father, Commissioner Gordon, and Fraser as the villain Firefly. The Hollywood Reporter said Batgirl\u2019s budget was a factor in the decision, having risen to nearly $90m (\u00a374.1m, A$130m) due to costs relating to it being shot during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Unlike most other computing devices, the Microsoft Surface Laptop SE is designed to be fully accessible for onsite repairs of common components, so students likely won\u2019t have to wait to get back to work if their SE breaks. With no moving parts and a strong chassis, the Microsoft Surface Laptop SE is about as tough as a laptop can be without adding specifically ruggedized components. And while elementary education is hardly a war zone, younger students likely don\u2019t treat their devices with as much care as adults. Microsoft talked with school administrators, teachers and IT professionals working with students ranging in age from kindergarten to eighth grade. It quickly became apparent that three key items \u2014 the screen, keyboard and battery \u2014 were the most commonly damaged or broken components on classroom laptops, especially in devices that also went home with students. Those three components made up 85 percent of all repair orders, and the repair process itself was also a detriment to education. Normally, broken units must be shipped to a factory or repair center that might take a week or longer to ship the device back \u2014 meaning broken laptops were not available to students for extended periods. The shipping costs also were often the responsibility of the school. Microsoft has revolutionized that process with the Microsoft Surface Laptop SE.","Jaccard Noise_80":0.5,"Cosine Noise_80":0.4907352328,"EM Noise_80":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":1,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"11.6 inchesMAX","Noise_100 Document Index":"0","Noise_100 Document":"For example, it\u2019s easy to create a lesson plan that pairs the Edge browser with\u00a0a videoconferencing window\u00a0using the 720p-resolution webcam.

Here\u2019s how it works. The M2 chip is here, ushering in the second generation of Apple's bespoke silicon The Apple M2 chip was unveiled at Apple's WWDC 2022 keynote on June 6, and it's the inaugural chip in Apple's second generation of bespoke silicon. This is significant because the M2 is an evolution of the remarkable M1 chip that debuted in 2020, and it powers Apple's new 13-inch MacBook Air 2022 and MacBook Pro 2022. These are successors to two of the best MacBooks on the market, so it's exciting to see what an M2 injection can do. The new Apple M2 chip debuted in two new laptops: the 13-inch MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, which launched in the Summer of 2022. The M2 chip is available in either the 13-inch MacBook Air 2022 (starting price: $1,199) or the MacBook Pro 2022 ($1,299), so you'll need to pay over $1k to get yourself an M2-powered MacBook.

Apple claims CPU improvements up to 18% and GPU improvements up to 35% compared to the M1.[3]  The M2 was followed by the professional-focused M2 Pro and M2 Max chips in January 2023.

The M2 is Apple's next-generation System on a Chip (SoC) developed for use in Macs and iPads. It marks Apple's continued work to transition away from the Intel chips that were used in Macs up until 2020. As a \"System on a Chip,\" the M2 integrates several different components, including the CPU, GPU, unified memory architecture (RAM), Neural Engine, Secure Enclave, SSD controller, image signal processor, encode\/decode engines, Thunderbolt controller with USB 4 support, and more, all of which power the different features in the Mac. Before Apple silicon, Macs used multiple chips for CPU, I\/O, and security, but Apple's effort to integrate these chips is the reason why the M2 is much faster and more efficient than Intel chips. The unified memory architecture that Apple has included is also a major factor because all of the technologies in the M2 are able to access the same data without having to swap between multiple pools of memory. Built into the M2 chip, the unified memory architecture means the CPU, GPU, and other processor components don't need to copy data between one another, and are able to access the same data pool.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.3333333333,"Cosine Noise_100":0.7838338614,"EM Noise_100":0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

In March 1953, the Gilberton Company published a comic-book adaptation of From the Earth to the Moon as issue No. 105 in its Classics Illustrated series.  An unidentified scriptwriter combined Verne's From the Earth to the Moon with the sequel, Around the Moon. Gilberton art director Alex A.

The title went through twelve printings between 1953 and 1971.[2]  During their return journey from the Moon, the crew of Apollo 11 made reference to Jules Verne's book during a TV broadcast on 23 July.[3] The mission's commander, astronaut Neil Armstrong, said, \"A hundred years ago, Jules Verne wrote a book about a voyage to the Moon.

Musk had begun buying shares of the company in January 2022, becoming its largest shareholder by April with a 9.1\u00a0percent ownership stake. Twitter invited Musk to join its board of directors, an offer he initially accepted before declining. On April 14, Musk made an unsolicited offer to purchase the company, to which Twitter's board initially responded with a \"poison pill\" strategy to resist a hostile takeover, before unanimously accepting Musk's buyout offer of $44\u00a0billion on April 25. Musk stated that he planned to introduce new features to the platform, make its algorithms open-source, combat spambot accounts, and promote free speech.  In July, Musk announced his intention to terminate the agreement, asserting that Twitter had breached their agreement by refusing to crack down on spambot accounts. The company filed a lawsuit against Musk in the Delaware Court of Chancery shortly thereafter, with a trial scheduled for the week of October 17. Weeks before the trial was set to begin, Musk reversed course, announcing that he would move forward with the acquisition. The deal was closed on October 27, with Musk immediately becoming Twitter's new owner and CEO. Twitter was taken private and merged into a new parent company named X Corp.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":1.0,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Elon Musk","Noise_20 Document Index":"6","Noise_20 Document":"Musk's acquisition of the social media company has been mired in controversy. The richest person in the world said he wanted to own one of the most popular social media platforms -- until he said he didn't. In early October, he reversed course again, saying he wanted to complete the deal. On Oct. 28, he finally did. Tesla CEO Elon Musk completed the deal to acquire Twitter at his original offer price of $54.20 a share at a total cost of roughly $44 billion. In the ensuing days, Musk fired top executives, laid off half of the company's staff, formed a content moderation council that will review account reinstatements and revamped the platform's subscription service. The changes at Twitter mark the latest chapter in a monthslong saga that began in January when Musk started investing in the social media company. Musk reached an acquisition deal with Twitter in April, but over the ensuing weeks, he raised concerns over spam accounts on the platform, claiming Twitter had not provided him with an accurate estimate of their number. Twitter rebuked that claim, saying it has provided Musk with information in accordance with conditions set out in the acquisition deal.","Jaccard Noise_20":1.0,"Cosine Noise_20":1.0,"EM Noise_20":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":1,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"Elon Musk","Noise_40 Document Index":"3","Noise_40 Document":"Apr 25, 2022 ...

But, within weeks, he began questioning the deal. Mr. Musk lashed out at the Twitter executives responsible for content decisions and accused the company of failing to accurately count the spam accounts on its platform. When Parag Agrawal, Twitter\u2019s chief executive, tried debunking Mr. Musk\u2019s claims, Mr. Musk responded by tweeting a poop emoji. By July, Mr. Musk had decided that he no longer wanted to own Twitter, arguing that he had been misled about the amount of spam on the platform. He announced his intent to abandon the acquisition.

Mr. Musk, who is one of Twitter\u2019s most active users and has more than 109 million followers, began accumulating shares in the company this year. In April, he struck the deal to buy the company for $44 billion and said he would lift Twitter\u2019s content moderation policies, eliminate spam, add new features and provide more transparency about the algorithms used to promote content. \u201cTwitter has tremendous potential \u2014 I look forward to working with the company and the community of users to unlock it,\u201d he said in a statement in April. But, within weeks, he began questioning the deal. Mr. Musk lashed out at the Twitter executives responsible for content decisions and accused the company of failing to accurately count the spam accounts on its platform. When Parag Agrawal, Twitter\u2019s chief executive, tried debunking Mr. Musk\u2019s claims, Mr. Musk responded by tweeting a poop emoji. By July, Mr. Musk had decided that he no longer wanted to own Twitter, arguing that he had been misled about the amount of spam on the platform. He announced his intent to abandon the acquisition.

But he only used some of his cash to buy Twitter for $44 billion. For the rest of it, he used a tactic called a leveraged buyout and spent $13 billion of borrowed money on the acquisition. And now Twitter\u2014not Elon\u2014is on the hook for that loan. Leveraged buyouts had a heyday in the 1980s, when corporate raiders would use debt to finance purchases of companies with healthy balance sheets.

Why? Because she's turning a moment that was supposed to be about her legacy, into a moment about her tennis. She set the stage for this special Open by writing last month that likely it would be her last.

This tournament marked the first time in the Open Era that four Chinese women reached the third round.[7] Elena Rybakina lost in the first round to Clara Burel; that marked the first time that the reigning Wimbledon champion had lost in the first round of the US Open since Petra Kvitov\u00e1 in 2011.[8] Elise Mertens had her streak of 18 consecutive major third-rounds broken after losing in the first round to Irina-Camelia Begu.

With Jabeur putting up so little resistance, she didn\u2019t need to do much more than hit deep into the court. Eventually, Jabeur either made an error or landed a shot somewhere around the service line, allowing Swiatek to move in and blast away. The first set was over in 30 minutes. The queens of women\u2019s tennis historically have done this sort of thing. Jabeur, the first Arab woman to reach a Grand Slam final in the Open Era and to reach the highest level of the sport, has arguably the most creative arsenal in the women\u2019s game. When she is on, she can mix jumping backhand drop shots with a dangerous forehand and a deceptively hard serve that she can land in the corners with nasty movement. She reached the Wimbledon final earlier this summer and held a one-set lead before tightening and getting overpowered by Elena Rybakina of Kazakhstan. Ahead of Saturday, she spoke of the lessons she had learned from that match and how she now knew ways to keep her emotions in check. But with Swiatek in top form, there was little that Jabeur, who has become an inspiration for Arab women, could do to stop the locomotive. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get that title sometime soon,\u201d she said after losing her second Grand Slam final of the year.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.3670161366,"EM Noise_100":0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

The new sensor, at 40mm\u00b2, is almost 50% larger than the iPhone 13 Pro\u2019s 26.9 mm\u00b2 sensor. While its aperture is slightly \u2018slower\u2019 (that is, smaller) the larger sensor compensates. How does the sensor and lens change stack up in practice? The iPhone 14 Pro easily outperforms the previous iPhone, creating far sharper shots: In multiple shots in various conditions, the shots were far more detailed and exhibited less visible processing than comparable iPhone 13 Pro shots: A nice side benefit of a larger sensor is a bit more shallow depth of field. At a 13mm full-frame equivalent, you really can\u2019t expect too much subject separation, but this shot shows some nice blurry figures in the background.  I believe that both Apple\u2019s new Photonic Engine and the larger sensor are contributing to a lot more detail in the frame, which makes a cropped image like the above shot possible. The \u2018my point of view\u2019 perspective that the ultra-wide provides puts you in the action, and a lack of detail makes every shot less immersive.  Is it all perfect?

Want to make sure you've got all the stylish details in order before the big night? E! News can help. Here's everything you need to know about the 2022 Met Gala. The 2022 Met Gala will take place May 2.  The name of the event is a bit of a giveaway.

American tennis player John Isner has been particularly successful at the event.

The former is responsible for mechanical technology, while the latter prefers magical tech. You can learn more in our Xenoblade Chronicles 3 colonies guide.    When in combat, you can battle with up to seven characters, and, much like in previous Xenoblade games, you must directly face an enemy out in the field to engage in a fight. Naturally, each character brings their own strengths to the battlefield, and this allows you to use a range of strategies. There is also a new mechanic called interlinking, which you can learn more about in our Xenoblade Chronicles 3 Ouroboros guide.

Just a week after its launch, Meta\u2019s Blender Bot 3 has turned on its creator and is already spewing marginally racist comments.

This set the foundational architecture for ChatGPT as we know it today. GPT-1 demonstrated the power of unsupervised learning in language understanding tasks, using books as training data to predict the next word in a sentence. GPT-2, which was released in February 2019, represented a significant upgrade with 1.5 billion parameters. It showcased a dramatic improvement in text generation capabilities and produced coherent, multi-paragraph text. But due to its potential misuse, GPT-2 wasn't initially released to the public.

The purchase of iRobot is Amazon's fourth-largest acquisition, led by its $13.7 billion deal to buy Whole Foods in 2017. Last month, the company said it would buy the primary care provider One Medical in a deal valued roughly at $3.9 billion, a move that expanded its reach further into health care.

The increase follows several others, including one just months ago, when the cost rose from $10,000 to $12,000. This latest hike is tied to a software update (FSD Beta 10.69.2), which improves overall driving smoothness through turns, enhances pedestrian and animal detection, and enables a creep-into-intersection function. Full Self-Driving is Tesla\u2019s disingenuously named suite of advanced driver-assistance features. Currently, it includes all the functionality of Basic and Enhanced Autopilot, plus the ability to slow the vehicle to a stop as it approaches red traffic signals and signs. If you see little importance or utility in the last of those things, you can still get the bulk of Tesla\u2019s magic with Enhanced Autopilot. It costs a relative bargain, at $6,000, and gives your vehicle the ability to park itself and navigate a highway route from on-ramp to off-ramp (including automatic lane changes) with minimal driver involvement. It also includes Summon, which allows the driver to direct a car into or out of a tight parking space while standing outside the vehicle, and Smart Summon, which enables the vehicle to wind its way around objects (such as in a parking lot) to meet the driver.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.9999999404,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"$15,000","Noise_20 Document Index":"5","Noise_20 Document":"Aug 21, 2022 ...

Condal and Miguel Sapochnik served as the showrunners for the first season.

Featuring an ensemble cast, the show portrays the events leading up to the beginning of the decline of House Targaryen, a devastating war of succession known as the \"Dance of the Dragons\".  House of the Dragon received a straight-to-series order in October 2019, with casting beginning in July 2020 and principal photography starting in April 2021 in the United Kingdom. The series premiered on August 21, 2022, with the first season consisting of ten episodes. Five days after its premiere, the series was renewed for a second season.

The first of two articles, Rising from the Ashes, detailed the story of that revival following the purchase of \u201cLe TeFeCe\u201d by RedBird Capital Partners, a United States-based investment fund valued at over $6billion (\u00a35.1bn), a little over two years ago.

In rather tedious news, Tencent and Sony Interactive Entertainment have acquired partial stakes in FromSoftware. More specifically, Tencent has 16.25% of shares and Sony Interactive Entertainment has 14.09% of shares in FromSoftware. The reason why this is boring is that Kadokawa is still the main owner (with 69.66% of the shares) and these new share acquisitions are both non-controlling stakes. In short, nothing has changed and neither Tencent nor Sony have any real decision-making power here. So if you were thinking that Sony would be able to force platform exclusivity for all future FromSoftware titles, then you would be wrong. This will just be business as usual, except that FromSoftware may have some more capital to play around with. One potentially interesting point here is that the money accrued from this will help FromSoftware bolster its publishing plans for the future. This is noteworthy because FromSoftware actually publishes its own games in Japan, so moving that to be more of a global endeavor would be better for all concerned. In that, in the past many of FromSoftware\u2019s games were released internationally by publishers that neither cared nor understood their games.

He resigned from the land agents, and in March travelled to England to join his mother and Lucy at Agnes's funeral. He never again lived in Ireland, and did not visit it for twenty-nine years.[2]  Initially, Shaw refused to seek clerical employment in London. His mother allowed him to live free of charge in her house in South Kensington, but he nevertheless needed an income. He had abandoned a teenage ambition to become a painter, and had not yet thought of writing for a living, but Lee found a little work for him, ghost-writing a musical column printed under Lee's name in a satirical weekly, The Hornet.[2] Lee's relations with Bessie deteriorated after their move to London.[n 6] Shaw maintained contact with Lee, who found him work as a rehearsal pianist and occasional singer.[21][n 7]  Eventually Shaw was driven to applying for office jobs. In the interim he secured a reader's pass for the British Museum Reading Room (the forerunner of the British Library) and spent most weekdays there, reading and writing.[25] His first attempt at drama, begun in 1878, was a blank-verse satirical piece on a religious theme.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.6598016024,"EM Noise_100":0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

The multi-time NASCAR Cup Series champion will join Richard Childress Racing in 2023, according to a report from Jordan Bianchi of The Athletic. The move ends a successful 15-year tenure with Joe Gibbs Racing. An official announcement is expected Tuesday, per the report. The news punctuates an eventful and \u201cstressful\u201d regular season for Busch, whose free agency dominated headlines and clouded a playoff-caliber season in 2022. It did so because his looming free agency revealed a strange reality in NASCAR economics \u2014 that one of the sport\u2019s biggest stars would have to struggle to find a home (even with taking a pay cut) because of something outside of his control. That \u201csomething\u201d outside of his control, in this case, was the result of the Mars Inc. decision to exit NASCAR at the end of the year, leaving Joe Gibbs Racing (Busch\u2019s current team) without a primary sponsor for Busch\u2019s No. 18 team. Busch confirmed to reporters earlier this month that he had \u201cmore than one\u201d team extend official contract offers to him. RCR was among those companies, per reports at the time. He also said that his uncertain future had been weighing on him. \u201cIt weighs on you every time, every day of the week,\u201d Busch said at NASCAR\u2019s playoff media day before the race at Darlington.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":1.0000001192,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Richard Childress Racing","Noise_20 Document Index":"2","Noise_20 Document":"36  Editor\u2019s Note: This story is included in The Athletic\u2019s Best of 2022.

Titans is leaving Gotham City and heading to Metropolis in its newest season, and it's bringing that city's biggest bad into the story. Superman's nemesis Lex Luthor is a major figure in the show's fourth season, and he's played by a veteran actor. Titus Welliver portrays the villain in the HBO Max TV series, and he's got the chops to be the best Lex Luthor yet. Known for playing somewhat hard-edged characters, Welliver is one of many who's taken on the role of Superman's arch-enemy. Set to make a big impact on the show Titans, Welliver will be the dark daddy of the show's Conner Kent. Here's a look at Welliver's filmography, and how he might stack up against past versions of Lex. RELATED: Titans' Superman Debut is Following the Thanos Formula - and It Works  Beginning his professional acting career in the early 1990s, Titus Welliver is perhaps more well-known for his TV roles. This included roles in several science fiction favorites back in the '90s, including TV series' such as The X-Files, Star Trek: Voyager and The CW's long-running show Supernatural.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.9999998808,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Titus Welliver","Noise_20 Document Index":"2","Noise_20 Document":"Nov 4, 2022 ...

Titus Welliver is set to play the iconic DC villain and Superman\u2019s archnemesis, Lex Luthor, in the upcoming season 4 of Titans. The show has been setting up Luthor\u2019s arrival since season two when Conner\/Superboy (played by Joshua Orpin) debuted in Titans. Superboy is a clone of both Clark Kent and Lex Luthor in Titans, and season 4 will explore the character\u2019s dark side. Titus Welliver is likely to play a major role in Titans season 4 as Lex Luthor, and taking on a fan-favorite antagonist comes with a big responsibility. Fans can get really picky nowadays, and Lex Luthor has been a major source of controversy for the past few years. Almost no one liked Jesse Eisenberg\u2019s young, temperamental version of Luthor, but Welliver at least is older and bears a resemblance to the character. However, he will be sporting a beard akin to Jon Cryer\u2019s iteration in the Arrowverse. You can check out the first look at Welliver as Lex Luthor below (courtesy of Entertainment Weekly).

Because the interesting thing about Lex Luthor is he doesn't have superpowers. But he possesses an incredible mind, so his life's work has been trying to figure out how the hell to either defeat Superman or obtain his powers. So when you're acting that stuff, you have to be careful because you can fall into the cliches of mustache-twirling and scary faces. I didn't want to do that. What I really wanted to do was to make him formidable with his stillness. Speaking of that stillness, one of my favorite moments in the season 4 premiere is when Starfire (Anna Diop) comes bursting into the penthouse and is beating up all the goons in the background while you're sitting in the foreground just calmly eating. That unflappability is scary! And also the fact that he's a gentleman. He's not fazed by it, and he has such a level of confidence, despite the fact that she has this incredible power.

So we can\u2019t ignore the significance of cloud cybersecurity moving forward as we continue to go completely digital in so many aspects of our lives. Cybersecurity companies are fighting for market share as data breaches and ransomware attacks become more common, more damaging and more expensive. With many companies turning towards cloud technology, it\u2019s no secret that companies like Google, Amazon and Microsoft are going to increase focus on this business sector. That said, Google\u2019s recent acquisition of the cyber security company, Mandiant, has stirred up a lot of conversation about the future of cloud cybersecurity and the highly competitive landscape therein. We\u2019re going to look at this space to see how much money the big players are making. It was announced on September 12 that Google\u2019s $5.4 billion bid to acquire the cybersecurity firm Mandiant was completed. Mandiant will be joining Google\u2019s cloud computing division so Google can attempt to compete with Amazon\u2019s AWS and Microsoft\u2019s Azure. This is Google\u2019s second-largest acquisition as the company aims to focus on enhancing its security operations suite and advisory services. With companies worldwide facing cyberattacks, the cloud cybersecurity space is expanding, and fast. With over 17 years of experience, Mandiant is a publicly-traded cybersecurity company that rose to prominence by discovering the SolarWinds attack where 18,000 clients unknowingly downloaded malware.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.9275108576,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"$5.4 billion","Noise_20 Document Index":"5","Noise_20 Document":"Google (GOOG, GOOGL) is finally sounding off on its blockbuster $5.4 billion acquisition of cybersecurity firm Mandiant, expressing the extent of the company's ambitions in the sector.

Again, Google Cloud is already strong when we think about how we analyze data and put it in context, and that only gets stronger with Mandiant.\u201d Venables was very clear that Google Cloud's ambitions in cybersecurity are massive, but on some level, the size of the deal already said it all. The acquisition is Google's second-largest ever, surpassed only by the company's $12.5 billion buyout of Motorola ten years ago. The more than $5 billion the company spent on Mandiant overshadows even what Google shelled out for Fitbit, which it bought for $2.1 billion.

Less-coveted than Bale and Ramsey but just as important, Davies led Ethan Ampadu and Joe Rodon through waves of Ukraine pressure. Heroic last-ditch tackles to deny Yarmolenko and Yaremchuk. A 71st cap, 10 years an international, his positional play has come on leaps and bounds under Antonio Conte at Tottenham. Another who has not played a lot of football recently, had an anxious moment when his attempts to play out from the back were shut down early on. Nearly punished for not dropping quick enough when Hennessey kept out Tsygankov with his feet, but the Spurs defender was purposeful in possession. Played Yaremchuk onside for an early chance and was grateful to Hennessey. Made a vital headed clearance from under his own crossbar. Indeed, it was as if Ampadu's head was a magnet to the ball. Wales warmed to their task from the moment Williams cut inside and fizzed a sighter wide. Switched off at the far post to nearly let Karavaev in but combined well with Daniel James going forward. Bristled with confidence at the start of the second period and stuck to his guns.

Tetsuya Yamagami was arrested immediately after allegedly shooting Abe with a homemade gun as the former leader was making a campaign speech on July 8 outside a train station in Nara in western Japan. Yamagami then underwent a nearly six-month mental evaluation prosecutors said showed he's fit to stand trial.   Yamagami was also charged with violating a gun control law, according to the Nara District Court. Police have said Yamagami told them he killed Abe, one of Japan's most influential and divisive politicians, because of Abe's apparent links to a religious group that he hated. In his statements and in social media postings attributed to him, Yamagami said he developed a grudge because his mother had made massive donations to the Unification Church that bankrupted his family and ruined his life.  One of his lawyers, Masaaki Furukawa, told The Associated Press on Thursday that Yamagami will have to take responsibility for the serious consequences of his alleged actions and that his defense lawyers will do their best to reduce his sentence.","Jaccard Noise_80":1.0,"Cosine Noise_80":1.0000001192,"EM Noise_80":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":1,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"Former Japanese Prime Minister","Noise_100 Document Index":"0","Noise_100 Document":"Jul 8, 2022 ...

Photograph by Ollie Upton \/ HBO We\u2019ve rounded the halfway point on\u00a0House of the Dragon\u00a0season 1, HBO\u2019s much-hyped\u00a0Game of Thrones\u00a0prequel series. House of the Dragon\u00a0will feature a large time jump between Episodes 5 and 6; when the dust settles, a bunch of major characters will be played by different actors, and the realm will be a very different place. The floodgates are beginning to open and we are finding out more and more about the last five episodes of season 1. HBO now has Episodes 6-10 listed on their official schedule, complete with runtimes. In addition,\u00a0Rotten Tomatoes\u2018\u00a0series page for the show has episode titles listed. We\u2019re going to lay it all out below, with the slight caveat that since the\u00a0Rotten Tomatoes\u00a0episode titles have not been officially confirmed by HBO, they must be taken with a grain of salt. The only episode title HBO has confirmed is for Episode 6. While the episode titles aren\u2019t confirmed by HBO, it\u2019s still enough to get us pretty excited. \u201cThe Lord of the Tides\u201d refers to the head of House Velaryon; why will that be so relevant during the longest episode of the season?

Trust in the Targaryens is starting to wane, especially when it comes to the Hightowers. Alicent has long been fed up with the royal family, so much so that her frustrations culminated in Larys Strong (Matthew Needham) burning his brother Harwin (Ryan Corr) and father Lionel (Gavin Spokes) alive. Not only does the event position Larys as a major player in the capital, but it also begets the return of Otto Hightower (Rhys Ifans), as he\u2019ll likely be reinstated as Hand of the King. Perhaps the most intriguing plotline in Episode 7 will involve a dragon. Vhagar is the largest and oldest dragon in the realm, and as teased in the trailer, someone\u2019s stolen her. The beast used to belong to Laena, but now that she has passed, it appears that someone wants her old dragon.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.2203540802,"EM Noise_100":0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

NBC showed off some initial footage from its upcoming reboot of Quantum Leap Monday, teasing an Earth-shattering debut for Dr. Ben Seong (Raymond Lee), a respected physicist who finds himself in the same predicament Scott Bakula's Dr. Samuel Beckett faced all those years ago. He's a man lost in the past, jumping from body to body in an effort to get back home. The pilot episode thrusts Dr. Seong back to 1989, where he must work to prevent a terrible tragedy from taking place amid the San Francisco Earthquake that occurred that same year.

Today, two tests have been spotted, and they bode pretty well for the GPU. The RTX 3060, which is still a favorite among Nvidia users, might be around 20% slower than the upcoming Ada Lovelace model. Will the RTX 4060 become one of the best GPUs, or at least one of the most popular models in this generation? One might think that a GPU that costs over $40,000 is going to be the best graphics card for gaming, but the truth is a lot more complex than that. In fact, this Nvidia GPU can't even keep up with integrated graphics solutions. Now, before you get too upset, you should know I'm referring to Nvidia's H100, which houses the GH100 chip (Grace Hopper). It's a powerful data center GPU made to handle high-performance computing (HPC) tasks -- not power PC games. It doesn't have any display outputs, and despite its extensive capabilities, it also doesn't have any coolers. This is because, again, you'd find this GPU in a data center or server setting, where it'd be cooled with powerful external fans.

Nvidia\u2019s choice to price the RTX 4090 the way it did was not the most popular decision it has ever made. After a couple of years of GPU shortage, most of us are tired of having to pay insane prices for our PC hardware. To see Nvidia not just continue that trend, but also tell its customers outright that cheaper GPUs are a thing of the past, was disheartening. Still, the RTX 4090 sold out and came back at scalper prices, with some eBay sales on launch day reaching as high as $5,000. There was a single sale for $9,999, but it\u2019s hard to believe that this was a legitimate purchase. The insanity of these prices made some of us actually look forward to the (also overpriced) RTX 4080, set with an MSRP (recommended price) of $1,200.

We only really have sales data from eBay, but let\u2019s see how these numbers compare. Since the launch of the RTX 4090 on October 12, a total of 3,050 units have been sold through the U.S. version of eBay, at an average price of $2,328. It\u2019s barely worth it to resell these cards right now. Around the time of the RTX 4080 launch (November 16), the sales of the 4090 started rising and have been on a steady, albeit slow, rise ever since. The prices are now close to what they were around the time of launch. The RTX 4080 is not doing so well. Only 281 units have been sold since November 16, at an average price of $1,496.

It is the ninth installment in the series, the ninth chronologically, and the sequel to 2018's God of War. Loosely based on Norse mythology, the game is set in ancient Scandinavia and features series protagonist, Kratos, and his now teenage son, Atreus. Concluding the Norse era of the series, the game covers Ragnar\u00f6k, the eschatological event which is central to Norse mythology and was foretold to happen in the previous game after Kratos killed the Aesir god Baldur.  The gameplay is similar to the previous 2018 installment. It features combo-based combat, as well as puzzle and role-playing elements. The gameplay has been revamped from the previous game: in addition to Kratos' main weapons, a magical battle axe and his double-chained blades, he also acquires a magical spear and his shield has become more versatile, with different types of shields that have differing offensive and defensive abilities. His son Atreus, as well as some other characters, provide assistance in combat and can be passively controlled.","Jaccard Noise_40":0.6666666667,"Cosine Noise_40":0.7897343636,"EM Noise_40":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":1,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"November 9, 2022","Noise_60 Document Index":"1","Noise_60 Document":"Apr 27, 2023 ...

{"Query":"How much does the Netflix Basic with Ads subscription cost?","Correct Answer":["6.99"],"Noise_0 Predicted Answer":"$6.99 per month","Noise_0 Document Index":"2","Noise_0 Document":"Related Stories Move over \"Stranger Things,\" the next big Netflix hit may just be commercials. The streaming giant on Thursday is rolling out its cheapest membership tier, dubbed \"Basic With Ads.\" The new tier will cost $6.99 per month, which makes it a full $3 cheaper than Netflix's current cheapest plan, the $9.99 Basic plan. It's Netflix's first foray into the ad-supported space \u2014 the streamer has for years resisted putting any advertising on its platform. The company's plan arrives on Nov. 3, a month before rival streaming service Disney+ will introduce its own ad-supported tier, and competes with ad-supported plans from services like Hulu and Peacock. The plan's launch comes as Netflix is preparing to crack down on password sharing on its platform. Beginning next year, Netflix will push people who borrow accounts to create their own, and will also give account-holders who share their passwords the ability to pay extra to have friends and family on their accounts. Here's what you need to know about Netflix's Basic With Ads tier. The Basic With Ads plan will operate similarly to the Basic plan. Users will have access to a 720p video stream \u2014 versus the 1080p stream offered by the $15.49 Standard plan and the 4K plan offered by the $19.99 Premium plan \u2014 which can be accessed from any internet-connected device.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.3333333333,"Cosine Noise_0":0.5771024227,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"$6.99 per month","Noise_20 Document Index":"8","Noise_20 Document":"Netflix\u2019s new ad tier is set to launch in the U.S. at 9 a.m. PT on Thursday, introducing commercials to the service for the first time in its 15-year history. Starting Thursday, the ad plan will be available in Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, the U.K., and the U.S. It will then launch in Spain on Nov. 10. At $6.99 per month, Netflix Basic with Ads costs less than half of Netflix\u2019s $15.49 Standard plan and almost a third less than its ad-free $9.99 Basic plan.  In exchange for that lower price tag, subscribers who switch to the ad-supported plan will have to watch an average of five minutes of ads per hour that are set to play before and during movies and TV shows. At launch, ads will be 15 to 30 seconds in length. During an October press call, Netflix chief operating officer and product chief Greg Peters said that new movies coming to Netflix \u201cwill just have a pre-roll\u201d of ads followed by an uninterrupted viewing experience in order to \u201cpreserve that cinematic model.\u201d He added that movies that have \u201cbeen on the service for a while\u201d will have a more \u201ctraditional\u201d mix of pre-roll and mid-roll ads.

The ads tier subscription is $6.99 per month \u2013 almost 55% lower per month than its Standard subscription. While the monthly cost is lower for consumers, the newest tier comes with hidden price tags. In the new Netflix Basic with Ads tier, users can expect around 4-5 minutes of ads per hour. How is this comparable to other Connected TV subscriptions? While the amount of ad time per hour for Netflix is comparable to other streaming services, the lingering issue is\u00a0when an ad will show. Ad timings are unpredictable, which interrupts the user experience. The video content for ads is about what you expect compared to other streaming services. But the same issue is at hand \u2013 when will this show up in a user\u2019s watching experience on Netflix? According to Jay Peters from\u00a0 The Verge, a user\u2019s ad experience varies dramatically between types of content consumed: As you can see from this example, the amount of ads, as well as the placement of ads, is inconsistent, which leads to believe that Netflix is testing to find the best engagement for not only users but advertisers. The second nuance with Netflix Basic with Ads tier comes from what shows and movies are offered at this level. Similar to the unpredictable ad experience, the available titles on the Basic tier seems extremely scattered without a rhyme or reason.","Jaccard Noise_40":0.3333333333,"Cosine Noise_40":0.5771024227,"EM Noise_40":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":1,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"$6.99 per month","Noise_60 Document Index":"4","Noise_60 Document":"Nov 2, 2022 ...

Three days after final ballots were cast in the 2022 midterm elections, more than two dozen House races have not yet been called, with a number of them in California and other areas in the western half of the country. In spite of that uncertainty, Republicans are already jockeying for power \u2014 while Democrats are enjoying the progress they\u2019ve made so far in beating expectations and defying historical headwinds. Republicans have a better chance of winning a majority in the House, though the Democrats still have a chance to retain control. As of Friday morning, Republicans have won 211 seats, Democrats have won 197 and 27 races remain uncalled. A party needs 218 seats to control the House. The Senate also hangs in the balance, as results in key races in Arizona and Nevada have not been decided. On Thursday night, NBC News rated the Nevada contest between Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto and her Republican challenger Adam Laxalt as too close to call. Arizona's Senate race between Democratic Sen.

With some races still not called a week after Election Day, Republicans picked up at least 218 seats, and will take over the chamber next year with GOP leaders facing blowback about failing to deliver in what many considered a favorable political environment for their party.   The potentially single-digit margin ushers in a new era of divided government in Washington. Going into the 2022 midterm elections, Democrats knew historic trends would favor that the party out of power gains seats.

However, turnout during the Trump administration was high, particularly in the 2018 midterm election, which gave Nancy Pelosi her second stint as Speaker of the House. But because the stakes of the midterms were high this year, we saw more people turning up to the booths. After the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, Democrats used abortion rights to win special elections in places like New York\u2019s Hudson Valley, in addition to flipping Alaska\u2019s lone House seat. Republicans, on the other hand, pointed to high inflation rates, government spending, and crime rates, which ultimately drove many voters to cast their ballots for the GOP.

Nevada\u2019s vote count\u00a0took several days\u00a0partly because of the mail voting system created by the state Legislature in 2020 that requires counties to accept ballots postmarked by Election Day if they arrive up to four days later. Laxalt had an early lead that dwindled after late-counted ballots came in from the state\u2019s population centers in Las Vegas and Reno. Cortez Masto, the state\u2019s former two-term attorney general, focused her Senate campaign on the increasing threat to abortion access nationwide and worked to court the state\u2019s Spanish-speaking residents and hourly wage earners, pointing out her support of a permanent pathway to citizenship for \u201cDreamers\u201d and regularly visiting union halls and workers\u2019 groups. Her fundraising far outpaced Laxalt\u2019s. She spent nearly $47 million and had more than $6 million in cash on hand through mid-October, according to OpenSecrets. Laxalt spent nearly $13 million and had about $3 million remaining during the same time. Laxalt, a former Nevada attorney general himself who unsuccessfully ran for governor in 2018, focused on rising inflation and a struggling economy for much of his campaign, attempting to tie voters\u2019 financial woes to policies advanced by Democrats in Congress and Biden.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.6666666667,"Cosine Noise_100":0.7351088524,"EM Noise_100":0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

However, little research has examined music in truly communicative contexts. The current work aims to facilitate the development of experimental approaches that rely on dynamic and naturalistic social interactions. We first review two longstanding lines of research that examine musical interactions by focusing either on the caregiver or the infant. These include defining the acoustic and non-acoustic features that characterize infant-directed (ID) music, as well as behavioral and neurophysiological research examining infants\u2019 processing of musical timing and pitch. Next, we review recent studies looking at early musical interactions holistically. This research focuses on how caregivers and infants interact using music to achieve co-regulation, mutual engagement, and increase affiliation and prosocial behavior. We conclude by discussing methodological, technological, and analytical advances that might empower a comprehensive study of musical communication in early childhood. Singing to infants is widely accepted as an enjoyable, positive, and beneficial interaction between the parent and infant across cultures. Whilst the literature suggests that live infant-directed singing impacts the infant, the parent doing the singing and the dyad in powerful ways, no systematic review of the evidence has yet been conducted. To this end, this systematic review identified 21 studies that investigated the effect of live parental infant-directed singing. These impacts were categorized as either being directly related to the infant, the parent, or the parent-infant dyad.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.1692010015,"EM Noise_100":0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

That was enough for them to finish top of their group, as they edged out South Korea, who also qualified as runners-up. Porto forward Mehdi Taremi, Feyenoord creator Alireza Jahanbakhsh and Bayer Leverkusen threat Sardar Azmoun make Iran a strong attacking unit, but their coaching situation has been the subject of most focus in the build-up. Dragan Skocic led them through qualification but was fired and then reportedly re-hired in quick succession in July, before eventually being replaced by ex-Manchester United tactician, Portuguese Carlos Querioz.

Each of those announcements occurred on September 11 \u2013 the day after Nebraska lost to Georgia Southern. Joseph is the first Black head coach in the history of Husker Athletics. In the news release Saturday, Alberts made no mention of what would happen to Joseph. Frost was fired because of his 16-31 record as the coach, Alberts said at the announcement back in September.

After a long stint at DC, Snyder is now one of Netflix\u2019s most prominent directors, creating the recent zombie apocalypse film Army of the Dead. His next project is the epic sci-fi fantasy Rebel Moon, which will likely be split into two massive features with the potential for spinoff properties. Army of the Dead came out in 2021 and became one of the most-watched movies on the platform and won the Oscars Fan Favorite contest. The heist film already spawned one prequel film, Army of Thieves, and the anime-style spinoff series Lost Vegas. A sequel film titled Planet of the Dead is also in the works. Based on Snyder\u2019s current Netflix track record, we can assume that Rebel Moon will follow a similar trajectory. Netflix officially announced the cast several months ago, but new cast members have been revealed, plus additional details about the movie.

Why trust us? These days, Google is all-in on AI, and Google Bard is its flagship product. It\u2019s an AI chatbot, and it\u2019s very much meant to be a rival to the ever-popular ChatGPT. And while it does replicate a lot of what ChatGPT does, Google has become highly invested in this space and has already made some significant updates to the tool that take it beyond what ChatGPT can do. Like ChatGPT, Google Bard is a conversational AI chatbot that can generate text of all kinds. You can ask it any question, as long as it doesn\u2019t violate its content policies, Bard will provide an answer. Although Bard hasn\u2019t officially replaced Google Assistant, it\u2019s a far more powerful AI assistant. That\u2019s because it\u2019s based on Google\u2019s own LLM (Large Language Model), known as LaMDA (Language Model for Dialogue Applications). Like OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3.5, the model behind ChatGPT, the engineers at Google have trained LaMDA on hundreds of billions of parameters, letting the AI \u201clearn\u201d natural language on its own.

In the story, the player assumes the role of a recently recruited member of the Rescue Corps, a group in need of rescuing following an unsuccessful attempt to save Captain Olimar.  Pikmin 4 received positive reviews from critics, who praised the game's level design, visuals, score, amount of content, and accessibility to newcomers, while criticizing the limited multiplayer options and low difficulty.  The player controls a minuscule character who takes command of squads of Pikmin to explore various areas, fight enemies, secure treasures, and solve puzzles.[2] Pikmin can be directed to perform various tasks, such as carrying objects and fighting enemies, and have individual weaknesses and strengths.

While many of these companies boomed during the coronavirus pandemic, some of the largest ones have reported financial results in recent weeks that showed they are feeling the fallout of global economic jitters. Last week, Elon Musk, the new owner of Twitter, laid off roughly half the company\u2019s 7,500 employees, saying the social media service was losing $4 million a day. \u201cThese cycles of boom and bust are incredibly destructive within organizations because people employed there feel like they don\u2019t know where they stand,\u201d said Sandra J. Sucher, a management professor at Harvard. By rapidly hiring across all departments during the pandemic, Mr. Zuckerberg had set up his company to need reductions in staff, she said. Mr. Zuckerberg has been telegraphing that Meta will have to clamp down on costs, starting with cutting back on many of the lavish perks that employees once enjoyed. In March, he announced that the company was trimming or eliminating free services like laundry and dry cleaning. He also scaled back free dinner offerings, making it harder for employees to take home dinner for themselves and their families. In July, Mr. Zuckerberg warned employees that the company was experiencing \u201cone of the worst downturns that we\u2019ve seen in recent history,\u201d and in September he announced a hiring freeze.

The coronavirus pandemic also supercharged the use of mobile apps, leading to more growth. At its peak last year, Meta had 87,000 full-time employees. But as the global economy soured, and digital advertising markets contracted last year, Mr. Zuckerberg began putting an end to unchecked growth. Meta trimmed employee perks. And after the layoffs in November, which largely affected the business divisions and recruiting teams, Mr. Zuckerberg hinted at further cuts. On an earnings call in February, the chief executive said he did not want the company to be overstuffed with a layer of middle management, or \u201cmanagers managing managers.\u201d He said he took responsibility for last year\u2019s layoffs, blaming his zeal for staffing up on the surge of use early in the pandemic. Meta\u2019s layoffs are part of a wave of job cuts from the biggest tech companies. In recent months, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Salesforce and others have also said they are trimming their ranks, and some of the companies have increased the number of people they are letting go after initial announcements. Many of the companies have cited a challenging global economic environment for their actions.

While there are clear data privacy concerns stemming from the Amazon iRobot acquisition, proving an anticompetitive argument could be trickier, Ray said. If a company like Shark --which also makes robot vacuums -- acquired iRobot, he believes that's a definitive competition concern. Amazon, however, isn't a market leader in vacuum robots, making it difficult to pinpoint the competition argument, he said. \"Obviously it makes iRobot a very serious competitor, and if I was making robot vacuum cleaners, I would be nervous,\" Ray said. \"But that's not enough to trigger a competition investigation.\" Ray said that subscription revenues are becoming increasingly important for companies needing long-term commitment and revenue, and Amazon could turn its iRobot acquisition into a subscription service. \"You could imagine paying for a Roomba on a subscription whereby spare parts are automatically sent to you, new brushes are automatically sent to you, and indeed the product itself would be cheap to make up for that,\" Ray said. \"So I think they see that as going towards a subscription service.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.1169645861,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":0,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Amazon","Noise_20 Document Index":"3","Noise_20 Document":"Aug 8, 2022 ...

So every year, they have to retrain to break down bad habits they\u2019ve developed when they aren\u2019t hanging out with humans every day. The trainers don\u2019t expect llamas to learn it once and remember it forever. We shouldn\u2019t expect that from humans either. Learning is continuous. While right after training, everyone may be very aware of what they are doing and very careful to do it correctly, as time passes we become more comfortable. We might forget what we\u2019ve learned. New challenges may change what we do. That\u2019s why we need to train continuously and retrain when something changes or a lot of time has passed. Everyone needs a refresher now and then to deliver a reliable experience.\u00a0 They set up every llama for a great, successful hike. If a llama isn\u2019t good with kids, they don\u2019t pair that llama with a kid. In the case of my hike, they gave my son a more experienced, no-drama llama, but gave me a llama with less experience.","Jaccard Noise_80":0.0,"Cosine Noise_80":0.6020257473,"EM Noise_80":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":0,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"Training smaller foundation models","Noise_100 Document Index":"9","Noise_100 Document":"Feb 24, 2023 ...

While not initially regarded as a serious contender, the campaign raised Riseborough's profile; dozens of celebrities praised her performance on social media, and some hosted screenings of the film during voting for the Academy Award nominations in January 2023.[44][45] Riseborough's nomination was announced on January 24, which the Los Angeles Times called \"one of the most shocking nominations in Oscar history\".[43]  After her nomination was announced, speculation arose that the tactics might have violated AMPAS rules against directly lobbying voters.[46] A post on the film's Instagram account was noted by several AMPAS members for possibly violating a rule prohibiting \"[singling] out 'the competition' by name\" by featuring a quote from film critic Richard Roeper, who praised Riseborough's performance as better than Cate Blanchett's in T\u00e1r, a fellow nominee for Best Actress.","Jaccard Noise_20":0.0,"Cosine Noise_20":0.3549932837,"EM Noise_20":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":0,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"Michelle Yeoh","Noise_40 Document Index":"2","Noise_40 Document":"Ford previously presented the top award in 1999 to \u201cShakespeare in Love.\u201d ___ For Michelle Yeoh, it was an Oscar.

The filing, which The Verge has also obtained, indicates that Musk incorporated the business on March 9th, 2023. Rumors about Musk starting up an AI company have been floating around for days, with a report from Business Insider revealing that Musk had purchased thousands of graphic processing units (GPUs) to power an upcoming generative AI product. The Financial Times similarly reported that Musk planned to create an AI firm to compete with the Microsoft-backed OpenAI. Musk even reportedly sought funding from SpaceX and Tesla investors to get the company started.

Twitter announced this week it was partnering with eToro to allow users to be able to trade stocks and crypto. It should be pretty clear by now that Musk\u2019s call for a six-month pause was purely out of self interest in the AI arms race, as I wrote at the time.

It really helps everything else. With our offense, with our defense. If we can run the ball, that to me is 100-level foundational stuff. And we\u2019re getting better there. \u201cI think we\u2019ve got a pretty good group up front on defense. We\u2019ve got some old heads at d-tackle that have got some weight on them, can press gaps and do things, and we were still able to get some movement on them guys. So it\u2019s a work in progress, but again, I think the O-line\u2019s improved, I think the running backs are better. I like what\u2019s happening in that room.

The contest resulted in a lop-sided affair, won by Team Maroon over Team White, with a final score of 34-0. Here are five takeaways from the action we saw on the field on Saturday: \u00a01. Quarterback Competition is far from over as Wells and Drones continue\u00a0to battle it out There was never going to be a definitive answer exiting the Spring Game, but we all got the chance to see the development of Grant Wells and the capabilities of Kyron Drones at the quarterback position. Wells finished 12-of-18 for 148 passing yards (66.7%) and a TD. He had 3 rushes for 10 yards and a rushing touchdown. Notably, Wells threw 6 passes that were gains of 16-or-more yards. The incumbent starter mostly linked up with the Gosnell brothers (Stephen and Benji) and Tucker Holloway. Wells\u00a0executed his plays and limited the risky elements of his playstyle. It also helps that he inherited the more stable offensive line, which once again benefited his performance.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.3333333333,"Cosine Noise_100":0.9205367565,"EM Noise_100":0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

Apple said on Tuesday it plans to open Apple BKC in Mumbai on April 18 and Apple Saket in Delhi on April 20. The iPhone-maker\u2019s first retail stores in India have been long-anticipated, but the limited market for high-end smartphones and laptops in the country has tempered Apple\u2019s expansion efforts. Despite being the world\u2019s second-largest internet market, the majority of smartphones sold in India are priced below $250. While India accounts for a small portion of Apple\u2019s overall revenue, the iPhone-maker has expressed optimism about the nation\u2019s potential for growth. Apple said that the new retail locations \u201cmark a significant expansion in India that will offer great new ways to browse, discover, and buy Apple products with exceptional service and experiences for customers.\u201d In preparation for the store openings, Apple has been actively recruiting employees in recent months, according to growing job postings.

In 2019, the last year his compensation included a triannual stock grant, his compensation was valued at $281 million.    Mr. Pichai said in January that top executives would get lower bonuses as part of cost-cutting measures, following the largest round of layoffs in the company\u2019s history. Last month, Google\u2019s finance chief told employees to expect more spending cuts.    Mr. Pichai\u2019s annual salary for 2020-2022 was $2 million, Friday\u2019s filing shows.    In December, the company granted a new triannual equity award to Mr. Pichai with a value of $210 million, according to a regulatory filing, consisting of both performance-based and time-based equity.    That grant contains two tranches of performance stock units with a target value of $63 million each, plus a grant of $84 million in the form of Alphabet\u2019s restricted stock units. Alphabet said in the filing that more of the latest stock award would be dependent on performance over time, increasing the proportion of performance stock units to 60% of the total from 43% in 2019.

Though we only got a sneak peek, the results are impressive and prove that an era of advanced image manipulation for the masses isn\u2019t far off, thanks to AI. Of course, AI-powered image editing is nothing new for Google. Handy tools like the Magic Eraser, for removing unwanted distractions, and Photo Unblur, for enhancing soft\/blurred shots, have been around for several years. And Google has been leveraging AI to help organize and surface images in users\u2019 libraries since 2015. But the Magic Editor takes AI-enhanced manipulation a leap further. Not only can users select and edit subjects (similar to using a mask in Lightroom\/Capture One) but with a few taps of the screen you can easily scale and reposition subjects in the frame. The demo also shows the tool's ability to expand an image\u2019s composition through generative AI. Of course, the results aren\u2019t perfect. In the example with the balloons, for instance, the portion of the bench created using generative AI shows a noticeable red tint. Similarly, in the waterfall demo, the area under the subject\u2019s arm shows an obvious repeating pattern in the rocks. These criticisms aside, the power of this tool to dramatically reshape image editing on the fly can\u2019t be understated.","Jaccard Noise_20":1.0,"Cosine Noise_20":0.9999998808,"EM Noise_20":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":1,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"Magic Editor","Noise_40 Document Index":"4","Noise_40 Document":"In its blog post explaining the tool, Google makes it seem like we\u2019re all in search of perfection, noting that the Magic Editor will provide \u201cmore control over the final look and feel of your photo\u201d while getting the chance to fix a missed opportunity that would make a photo look its best. Call me some type of weird photo purist, but I\u2019m not a fan of editing a photo in a way that would alter my memory of an event. If I was taking a picture of a wedding and the sky was cloudy, I wouldn\u2019t think about swapping it for something better. Maybe \u2014 just maybe \u2014 I might consider moving things around or amping up the sky on a picture I\u2019m posting to social media, but even that seems a little disingenuous. But, again, that\u2019s just me. I could still see plenty of people using the Magic Editor to perfect their photos for social media, which adds to the larger conversation of what exactly we should consider a photo and whether or not that\u2019s something people should be obligated to disclose.

We plan to give select Pixel phones early access later this year.          Since its launch in 2015, Google Photos has used AI to help you get the most out of your memories \u2014 from automatically organizing and resurfacing your photos to helping you edit them with advanced tools like Magic Eraser and Photo Unblur. Today at I\/O, we gave a sneak peek of Magic Editor, a new experimental editing experience that uses generative AI to help you reimagine your photos and make editing even easier. With Magic Editor, you\u2019ll be able to make complex edits without pro-level editing skills. Using a combination of AI techniques, including generative AI, it will help you make edits to specific parts of an image \u2014 like the subject, sky or background \u2014 so you have even more control over the final look and feel of your photo. Sometimes the difference between a so-so picture and the perfect shot comes down to getting the framing just right. Magic Editor will help you improve the overall composition of your photo by allowing you to reposition the subject of your shot to the best spot. For example, if you\u2019re trying to get the perfect photo from your time at a popular waterfall, you could remove the bag strap you forgot to take off.

{"Query":"What is the price of the Apple Vision Pro headset?","Correct Answer":["$3,499","$3499"],"Noise_0 Predicted Answer":"$3,499","Noise_0 Document Index":"1","Noise_0 Document":"Games can be played with Bluetooth game controllers that connect to the headset.  Apple Vision Pro is priced starting at $3,499 and it is set to launch in early 2024. It will be available on Apple.com when it launches, and in stores only in the United States to begin with. Note: See an error in this roundup or want to offer feedback? Send us an email here. Apple Vision Pro is a \"mixed reality\" headset, meaning it can display both virtual and augmented reality content. It is not like augmented reality glasses, however, as it is designed to completely cover the eyes and block out all of your surroundings.   Apple is using exterior and interior cameras for the augmented reality component of the device. The cameras are able to map the space around you and project the real world back to you, so though you're not actually looking at what's around you using see-through glasses, you are effectively seeing an accurate picture of your real world environment.  With this capability, Apple can show you 3D windows, objects, and content in your actual space, or the cameras can be turned off to shut out the world to provide an entirely virtual setting. Apple is focusing on the headset's ability to allow for working, content consumption, gaming, communication and other activities to be done \"anywhere\" with just the Vision Pro.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":1.0,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"$3,499","Noise_20 Document Index":"4","Noise_20 Document":"But it\u2019s essentially the same tools, for seven times the price - and you can\u2019t even comfortably go outside and catch Pokemon in AR with it?

The Apple Vision Pro is worn over the head, and it is a virtual\/augmented reality headset with similar to the PlayStation VR or Meta Quest.   Design wise, the Vision Pro looks similar to a pair of ski goggles, albeit high-end goggles. It features a laminated glass front, which Apple says was \"three-dimensionally formed.\" The glass is attached to a curved aluminum alloy frame that wraps around the face. As of now, the headset is only available in silver with matching gray Light Seals and bands.  The frame connects magnetically to a Light Seal that sits on the face, and Apple offers the Light Seal in a range of sizes and shapes to fit different faces. A tight fit with the Light Seal is essential for blocking out light and proper operation of the headset. Apple designed the Light Seal to be flexible so that it can conform to individual face shapes.   At the side of the headset, there are two audio straps that are equipped with speakers that support spatial audio. The audio straps connect to a 3D braided fabric strap that secures the headset to the back of the head, with an adjustable dial for tightening it up for a customizable fit.","Jaccard Noise_40":1.0,"Cosine Noise_40":0.9999999404,"EM Noise_40":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":1,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"Vision Pro","Noise_60 Document Index":"8","Noise_60 Document":"The headset features 12 cameras, six microphones and five sensors to allow for eye tracking, hand tracking and voice commands to be all you need to control the device. Then inside the headset is a ring of LED lights that project invisible patterns onto your eyes to assist with the eye-tracking. These LED lights also power Optic ID, which is the Vision Pro's version of Face ID. Under the hood, the Vision Pro is powered entirely by Apple silicon. An M2 chip does most of the heavy lifting, but a brand-new R1 chip handles the sensor inputs and ensures the display doesn't lag behind. Apple says the R1 chip keeps the input lag of the twin 4K Micro OLED displays at just around 12ms \u2014 on par with a lot of the best TVs. Finally, Apple promises spatial audio thanks to a speaker on each side of the headset, near where it connects with your Head Band. These speakers \u2014 or audio pods \u2014 provide what Apple calls \"the most advanced Spatial Audio system ever.\" The individually amplified drivers inside each audio pod can even be fine-tuned to deliver Personalized Spatial Audio based on your head and ears. And it's not only the Apple Vision Pro spec sheet that matters here.

N421 is Apple's long-rumored augmented reality glasses device, though Gurman cautioned that it may not launch for some time. Gurman's latest report is the first concrete indication of what Apple's first headset product could be called.

In 2022, shoppers purchased more than 300 million items worldwide during the 2022 event. That was up from 250 million the year before, Amazon said. Historically, Prime Day has been a chance for Amazon to heavily promote its own products, like its Alexa-enabled devices. Those gadgets usually make the retailer\u2019s list of Prime Day bestsellers each year. But for the past few years, Amazon has invested more heavily in spotlighting marketplace sellers in their deals. And it\u2019s paying off for third-party merchants participating in the sale. For the past several years, a Digital Commerce 360 analysis shows the share of marketplace sales is growing on Prime Day. Third-party merchants\u2019 sales accounted for 37.2% of all Prime Day sales through Amazon in 2022, up from 36.0% in 2021 and 35.1% in 2020.  Amazon Prime Day 2023 will be Tuesday, July 11, and Wednesday, July 12. We\u2019ll update this page regularly with updates. A second Prime Day event will likely fall in October. Dates for Amazon Prime Day in the past: Up until 2022, Amazon Prime Day was once a year in the summer.

A notable difference: Rice accomplished all of those things in a whole career, while Kupp did it in one season.  Set a record for receptions (33) and tied for the second-most receiving yards (478) and receiving touchdowns (6) in a postseason in NFL history. Caught a touchdown in each of the Rams' four postseason games, making him the second player in league history to do that in a single postseason, along with former Arizona Cardinals wideout Larry Fitzgerald. Joined former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Joe Montana as the only players to win Offensive Player of the Year and Super Bowl MVP in the same season. Became the first player to lead the league in receiving and win a Super Bowl since Rice in 1994. When it was over and his vision had become reality, Kupp struggled to find words on the podium.
