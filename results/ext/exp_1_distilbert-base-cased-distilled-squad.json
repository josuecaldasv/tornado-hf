{"Query":"The genre of the drama \"Good Sam\" is what?","Correct Answer":["medical"],"Noise_0 Predicted Answer":"medical comedy","Noise_0 Document Index":"5","Noise_0 Document":"With Zach Braff's role as JD\u00a0in the show drawing a cult fanbase, Scrubs had a successful 9 season run.\u00a0 Barring the physical environment, Scrubs might not have much in common with Good Sam. But if viewers need a break from the usual sentimentality of the medical drama genre, they must check out a medical comedy of which a prime example is Scrubs.  The Flowers family is an odd lot with unresolved issues. As each member's mental exhaustion and social insecurities start coming out in the open, a familial fallout is inevitable. Even though Flowers is filled with memorable scenes of dark humor, the show has its fair share of heartbreaking outbursts that might prompt viewers to go for the tissues.\u00a0 RELATED:\u00a0Olivia Colman's Top 10 Movie & TV Roles, Ranked According To IMDb Much like the central relationship in Good Sam, Flowers shows how unresolved emotional conflicts can affect a family. Sam and Rob can resolve their issues if they didn't have much emotional baggage in the first place.\u00a0 The titular hospital in New Amsterdam is a legendary institution but it also suffers from outdated facilities. With the arrival of a young and passionate medical director, the hospital's fate seems to change.\u00a0 Medical reform is necessary for any such institution given the transient nature of the profession. In his pursuit to reform the hospital, Dr. Max Goodwin must definitely be at loggerheads with older doctors and bureaucrats.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.5,"Cosine Noise_0":0.6686493158,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"medical genre","Noise_20 Document Index":"5","Noise_20 Document":"Mar 25, 2020 ...

Samantha Griffith (Sophia Bush) is a competent heart surgeon who became the head of the department after her hard-to-please father, Dr. Rob Griffith (Jason Isaacs), suffered an accident, thereby losing his title as department head. The switch-up leads Sam and her father to try to reconcile their relationship as Sam finds her way as a leader. This show seems to suggest CBS is keeping to its mission to steadily showcase more diverse, complicated storylines. While Good Sam could have easily been just a run-of-the-mill medical show about a problem of the week, the series also entangles its characters in some thorny familial drama. This adds a new layer to what fans of this type of genre might be used to, and thankfully so. Bush, who once headlined another procedural, Chicago P.D., is great at playing a woman who has grown tired of trying to please her father and wants to show her worth as a doctor on her own terms. English actor Isaacs' American accent falters at the beginning of the first episode, but by the time it's ended, you believe he's a difficult man who might have a good heart, but is buried underneath guilt and unresolved trauma.","Jaccard Noise_40":0.0,"Cosine Noise_40":0.2342700511,"EM Noise_40":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":0,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"road-trip films","Noise_60 Document Index":"9","Noise_60 Document":"May 29, 2023 Few things feel like summer, quite like taking a vacation or going to the movies.

That represents a healthy 87 percent increase over 2020, when the company handed over 499,550 Teslas to customers. Even better for the company, it ended the year with a bang, racking up a record number of sales in the last quarter of 2021, or 308,600 units. Most of that total consisted of Model 3 and Model Y models, no surprise. It\u2019s the sixth consecutive quarter that it breaks its record for sales. In 2019, the automaker delivered 367,500 units, so annual sales growth, while not exponential, is clearly accelerating. The company has said in the past that one its main goals is to attain 50 percent sales growth year after year. Once upon a time, Tesla struggled mightily to hit its delivery targets, but no more. There\u2019s also no sign of that growth slowing down any time soon, even as all-electric rivals join the market by the month.

Another noteworthy aspect is the positive evolution of Tesla\u2019s revenue mix, which bodes well for H2 \u2013 when we expect further margin contraction in the car sales department. With improvements in revenue from Energy and Services, Tesla gains greater flexibility to continue its strategy of offering competitive prices and driving more sales. While it\u2019s true that Tesla\u2019s recent rally may have been excessive in the short term, the overall trajectory of the company remains positive. Thus, investors should exercise caution before betting against Tesla, as it continues to exceed expectations and enhance its long-term prospects.\u201d While other automakers delivered their worst sales figures in a decade, Tesla\u2019s delivery statistics were praiseworthy in 2022. The company delivered 1,313,851 vehicles to customers worldwide and, in so doing, increased its deliveries by 40% in comparison to the previous year. It also produced 47% more cars in 2022 compared to 2021.

The awards show that is supposed to honor excellence in film and TV has been trying to recover from a racial exclusion scandal after a 2021 Los Angeles Times story revealed that none of the 87 Hollywood Foreign Press members was Black. Tom Cruise subsequently gave back his Globes, NBC opted not to air the ceremony last year, and reform in the form of inclusivity began to take shape. After Jerrod Carmichael explained to the audience at the Beverly Hilton how he wound up as the host (spoiler: \"I'm here because I'm Black,\" he quipped before launching into a detailed and honest account of his decision-making process), the trophy distribution began. The Banshees of Inisherin, which led all movies with eight nominations, struck up a meaningful friendship with Globes voters over the evening: The Irish-island-set tragicomedy took home the best comedy film trophy, while Colin Farrell triumphed in the acting category and writer-director Martin McDonagh won for best screenplay. The Fablemans also came into frame by winning best drama film honors and best director (Steven Spielberg). Meanwhile, Everything Everywhere All at Once prevailed in two dimensions, as Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan netted acting trophies.","Jaccard Noise_80":0.0,"Cosine Noise_80":0.3018239439,"EM Noise_80":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":0,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"The Way of WaterElvisThe Fabelmans","Noise_100 Document Index":"6","Noise_100 Document":"All the winners of the 80th annual ceremony from the world of TV and film Avatar: The Way of WaterElvisThe Fabelmans \u2013 WINNERT\u00e1rTop Gun: Maverick BabylonThe Banshees of Inisherin \u2013 WINNEREverything Everywhere All at OnceGlass Onion: A Knives Out MysteryTriangle of Sadness Better Call SaulThe CrownHouse of the Dragon \u2013 WINNEROzarkSeverance Abbott Elementary \u2013 WINNERThe BearHacksOnly Murders in the BuildingWednesday Black BirdMonster: The Jeffrey Dahmer StoryPam and TommyThe DropoutThe White Lotus: Sicily \u2013 WINNER Jeff Bridges, The Old ManKevin Costner, Yellowstone \u2013 WINNERDiego Luna, AndorBob Odenkirk, Better Call SaulAdam Scott, Severance Taron Egerton, Black BirdColin Firth, The StaircaseAndrew Garfield, Under the Banner of HeavenEvan Peters, Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story \u2013 WINNERSebastian Stan, Pam and Tommy Jessica Chastain, George and TammyJulia Garner, Inventing AnnaLily James, Pam and TommyJulia Roberts, GaslitAmanda Seyfried, The Dropout \u2013 WINNER Jennifer Coolidge, The White Lotus \u2013 WINNERClaire Danes, Fleishman Is in TroubleDaisy Edgar-Jones, Under the Banner of HeavenNiecy Nash-Betts, Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer StoryAubrey Plaza, The White Lotus F","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.3937289119,"EM Noise_100":0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

That version had been abandoned in favor of an integrated solution. The first Hololens emerged from this project, called \"Baraboo\".

The RSC will help the company build new and better AI models, working across hundreds of different languages, and to develop new augmented reality tools. Developing the next generation of advanced AI will require powerful new computers capable of quintillions of operations per second. Meta\u2019s researchers have already started using RSC to train large models in natural-language processing (NLP) and computer vision for research, with the aim of one day training models with trillions of parameters across Meta\u2019s businesses, from content-moderation algorithms used to detect hate speech on Facebook and Instagram, to augmented-reality features that will one day be available in the metaverse. RSC can train models that use multimodal signals to determine whether an action, sound or image is harmful or benign. Meta claims this will not only help keep people safe on Meta\u2019s services today, but also in the metaverse.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.2727876604,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"AI Research SuperCluster","Noise_20 Document Index":"4","Noise_20 Document":"Jan 24, 2022 ...

The company however reckons that to fully realise the benefits of advanced AI\u2014 self-supervised learning of various domains whether vision, speech, language \u2014will require training large and complex models for critical use cases like identifying harmful content on Meta's platform. Computer vision, for example, needs to process larger, longer videos with higher data sampling rates. Speech recognition needs to work well even in challenging conditions with a lot of background noise and needs to understand more languages, dialects, and accents, Meta said. The company therefore decided that the best way to accelerate progress was to design a new computing infrastructure, RSC. There are very large-scale scientific problems that need the right level of depth, accuracy and speed, like modelling all the climate change phenomena, which cannot be handled with the current generation of supercomputers, Bertrand said. Meta said that RSC will help its researchers build better AI models that can learn from trillions of examples, work across hundreds of different languages, seamlessly analyse text, images and video together, power real-time voice translations to large groups of people speaking different languages so that they can collaborate on a research project or play an AR game together, and develop new augmented reality tools.

In the comic's sister series\u00a0Incorruptible, supervillain Max Damage responds to Plutonian's evil by transforming into a superhero.

Unlike most other computing devices, the Microsoft Surface Laptop SE is designed to be fully accessible for onsite repairs of common components, so students likely won\u2019t have to wait to get back to work if their SE breaks. With no moving parts and a strong chassis, the Microsoft Surface Laptop SE is about as tough as a laptop can be without adding specifically ruggedized components. And while elementary education is hardly a war zone, younger students likely don\u2019t treat their devices with as much care as adults. Microsoft talked with school administrators, teachers and IT professionals working with students ranging in age from kindergarten to eighth grade. It quickly became apparent that three key items \u2014 the screen, keyboard and battery \u2014 were the most commonly damaged or broken components on classroom laptops, especially in devices that also went home with students. Those three components made up 85 percent of all repair orders, and the repair process itself was also a detriment to education. Normally, broken units must be shipped to a factory or repair center that might take a week or longer to ship the device back \u2014 meaning broken laptops were not available to students for extended periods. The shipping costs also were often the responsibility of the school.

Over the years, she has wowed audiences with her versatile performances in all kinds of genres that have earned her several awards, and she rose to fame for starring in films such as Speed, Miss Congeniality and While You Were Sleeping, among many others. However, acting is not the only discipline in which Bullock has excelled over the years, as she is a never-ending source of talent. A little known fact about her is that she plays the piano very well, as she took lessons for 12 years. However, regardless of how good she was at it, she did not enjoy it at all. Besides her talent in acting and playing the piano, Bullock can also speak German and took ballet and vocal arts classes.

This guide highlights everything you need to know about the M2 chip, from performance improvements to extra features.    The M2 is Apple's next-generation System on a Chip (SoC) developed for use in Macs and iPads. It marks Apple's continued work to transition away from the Intel chips that were used in Macs up until 2020. As a \"System on a Chip,\" the M2 integrates several different components, including the CPU, GPU, unified memory architecture (RAM), Neural Engine, Secure Enclave, SSD controller, image signal processor, encode\/decode engines, Thunderbolt controller with USB 4 support, and more, all of which power the different features in the Mac. Before Apple silicon, Macs used multiple chips for CPU, I\/O, and security, but Apple's effort to integrate these chips is the reason why the M2 is much faster and more efficient than Intel chips. The unified memory architecture that Apple has included is also a major factor because all of the technologies in the M2 are able to access the same data without having to swap between multiple pools of memory. Built into the M2 chip, the unified memory architecture means the CPU, GPU, and other processor components don't need to copy data between one another, and are able to access the same data pool.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.3333333333,"Cosine Noise_100":0.7838338614,"EM Noise_100":0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

G. Wells' 1901 novel The First Men in the Moon (also relating to the first voyagers to the Moon) the protagonist, Mr. Bedford, mentions Verne's novel to his companion, Professor Cavor, who replies (in a possible dig at Verne) that he does not know what Bedford is referring to. Verne returned the dig later when he pointed out that he used gun cotton to send his men to the Moon, an actual substance. \"Can Mr. Wells show me some 'cavourite'?\", he asked archly.  The novel (along with Wells' The First Men in the Moon) inspired the first science fiction film, A Trip to the Moon, made in 1902 by Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s. In 1958, another film adaptation of this story was released, titled From the Earth to the Moon. It was one of the last films made under the RKO Pictures banner. The story also became the basis for the very loose adaptation Jules Verne's Rocket to the Moon (1967), a caper-style British comedy starring Burl Ives and Terry-Thomas. The 1961 Czechoslovak film The Fabulous Baron Munchausen combines characters and plot elements from the Verne novel with those of the stories of Baron Munchausen and Cyrano de Bergerac.[citation needed]","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.5549603701,"EM Noise_100":0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

In winning the title, Nadal broke the record for all-time men's major singles title - it was previously tied at 20 between himself, Novak Djokovic, and Roger Federer. The women's singles title was won by Ashleigh Barty, who won her first Australian Open title and third major title. She defeated 27th seed Danielle Collins in straight sets.

Ranging from interactive activities to some of the biggest names in the world, the Australian Open doesn't disappoint. Looking back, the 2022 event was nothing short of outstanding. Australian Ash Barty broke a 44-year-old record to claim her first Grand Slam on her home turf. While Rafael Nadal - who notched his 21st Grand Slam - remarkably came back from two sets to love to defeat 2021 US Open (tournament before Aus Open) champion Daniil Medvedev. Here's how it played out. Barty came into the tournament ranked no.1 in the world and knew what it took to win a Grand Slam. Having previously won at Wimbledon (2021) and the French Open (2019), the Queenslander wanted to take home the prize that meant the most: a trophy on her home soil. Despite the pressure of expectation to take out the 2022 championship, Barty's form never wavered throughout the two weeks, resulting in no sets lost.

Nadal defeated Medvedev, 2\u20136, 6\u20137(5\u20137), 6\u20134, 6\u20134, 7\u20135, in 5 hours and 24 minutes to win his second Australian Open title, and a then all-time record 21st major men's singles title.

The new sensor, at 40mm\u00b2, is almost 50% larger than the iPhone 13 Pro\u2019s 26.9 mm\u00b2 sensor. While its aperture is slightly \u2018slower\u2019 (that is, smaller) the larger sensor compensates. How does the sensor and lens change stack up in practice? The iPhone 14 Pro easily outperforms the previous iPhone, creating far sharper shots: In multiple shots in various conditions, the shots were far more detailed and exhibited less visible processing than comparable iPhone 13 Pro shots: A nice side benefit of a larger sensor is a bit more shallow depth of field. At a 13mm full-frame equivalent, you really can\u2019t expect too much subject separation, but this shot shows some nice blurry figures in the background.  I believe that both Apple\u2019s new Photonic Engine and the larger sensor are contributing to a lot more detail in the frame, which makes a cropped image like the above shot possible. The \u2018my point of view\u2019 perspective that the ultra-wide provides puts you in the action, and a lack of detail makes every shot less immersive.  Is it all perfect?

While we can dedicate an entire post to the details of camera sensors, allow me to briefly explain the benefits. Apple has a few main desires when it comes to its camera. Resolution was not the only reason to move to a more advanced, larger and higher pixel-count sensor. Apple desires speed, low noise, light gathering ability, dynamic range (that is, detail in both shadow and light areas) and many more things from this sensor.  As we mentioned before, algorithms are required to \u2018de-mosaic\u2019 this color information.

Formerly the BB&T Atlanta Open, the tournament dates back to 1921, having first lived in Indianapolis before moving to Atlanta. However, under current ownership, the event has run since 2010.  American tennis player John Isner has been particularly successful at the event. Since 2010, he\u2019s made his way to nine finals and won six, including 2021, so we\u2019ll see if he can claim it again in 2023. This year marks the tournament\u2019s highest prize money, with the winner taking home $112,125 and the runner-up landing a $65,405 check, a 4% increase for both over 2021. In doubles, players don\u2019t see as much prize money, but the winning pair will claim $38,960, while the runner-up will earn $20,850. Like singles, that\u2019s a 4% increase compared to last year for both.","Jaccard Noise_80":0.0,"Cosine Noise_80":0.3825470209,"EM Noise_80":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":0,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"the winner at the Atlanta Open will take home $112,125","Noise_100 Document Index":"4","Noise_100 Document":"For 2022, the winner at the Atlanta Open will take home $112,125, which translates to \u20ac101,366 and \u00a387,473.

Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is an action role-playing game with a large open world. Unlike previous Xenoblade games, the game allows for up to seven party members to participate in battles at once, including the main party of six and an additional \"Hero\" character. Up to 19 Heroes can be recruited to the party through story events or sidequests, each with different skills and abilities. Party members also have the ability to change their character class, granting them access to different abilities; raising a Hero's affinity with the party will unlock their class for use. Like the previous entries, the game has an open world design, with a day-and-night time cycle that affects in-game events, such as the availability of quests and items. The game takes place in a continuous open world that is the largest map featured in the series to date.[1] It also features a fast travel option for quicker traversal, as well as the option to activate navigation that will mark a line on the ground to follow if players are unsure of how to reach their destination.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.7089412212,"EM Noise_100":0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

Sam Bowman, who was not involved in the research, said the results do not necessarily indicate a lack of abstract reasoning abilities, because the test is visual, while GPT-4 is a language model.[27]  GPT-4 was trained in two stages. First, the model was given large datasets of text taken from the internet and trained to predict the next token (roughly corresponding to a word) in those datasets. Second, human reviews are used to fine-tune the system in a process called reinforcement learning from human feedback, which trains the model to refuse prompts which go against OpenAI's definition of harmful behavior, such as questions on how to perform illegal activities, advice on how to harm oneself or others, or requests for descriptions of graphic, violent, or sexual content.[28]  Microsoft researchers suggested GPT-4 may exhibit cognitive biases such as confirmation bias, anchoring, and base-rate neglect.[16]  OpenAI did not release the technical details of GPT-4; the technical report explicitly refrained from specifying the model size, architecture, or hardware used during either training or inference.","Jaccard Noise_80":0.3333333333,"Cosine Noise_80":0.7986887693,"EM Noise_80":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":0,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"April 20, 2023","Noise_100 Document Index":"2","Noise_100 Document":"What we know about the new GPT-4 model Last Updated on April 20, 2023  OpenAI\u2019s CEO has already confirmed a new model that is set to replace GPT-3.5.

The purchase of iRobot is Amazon's fourth-largest acquisition, led by its $13.7 billion deal to buy Whole Foods in 2017. Last month, the company said it would buy the primary care provider One Medical in a deal valued roughly at $3.9 billion, a move that expanded its reach further into health care. On Friday, groups advocating for stricter antitrust regulations called on regulators to block the iRobot merger, arguing it gives Amazon more access into consumers' lives and furthers its dominance in the smart home market. \"The last thing American and the world needs is Amazon vacuuming up even more of our personal information,\" said Robert Weissman, president of the progressive consumer rights advocacy group Public Citizen. \"This is not just about Amazon selling another device in its marketplace,\" Weissman said. \"It's about the company gaining still more intimate details of our lives to gain unfair market advantage and sell us more stuff.","Jaccard Noise_80":0.3333333333,"Cosine Noise_80":0.7173669934,"EM Noise_80":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":0,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"49 billion","Noise_100 Document Index":"3","Noise_100 Document":"49 billion all-cash deal, which if approved would put the health data of millions in its keeping. \u201cPeople tend to think of Amazon as an online seller company, but really Amazon is a surveillance company.

But many Windows users aren't yet being offered it for download. It's important to understand that we're in the \u201cseeker\u201d era for Windows 11 22H2. Microsoft still has a variety of hardware and third-party issues to work through, which is why you might not get offered 22H2 right away. But there is a mechanism you can use to review any hard blocks on your system. (If you want to get 22H2 sooner rather than later, you could opt into the Insider release track, which ensures you get the beta versions of Windows 11 \u2014 but that also exposes your hardware to possible bugs, side effects, and other issues.) Courtesy of Adam Gross, you can use a GitHub script to determine exactly why your system is not being offered 22H2. You can either download the PowerShell script from the Github site or follow these commands to determine what might be blocking Windows 11 22H@ from showing up on your hardware.. First, search for PowerShell and then right-mouse click and run as administrator.

AMD says these are based on an optimized version of TSMC's high-performance 5nm process technology called N5, and they are placed much closer together than we've seen with previous Ryzen core chiplets. In addition, we see what appears to be a shim between the two core chiplets, likely to maintain an even surface atop the two dies. It is also possible that this close orientation is due to some type of advanced packaging interconnect between the two chips.  We can also see a clear outline around the top of each CCD, but we aren't sure if this is from a new metallization technique. We do know that the gold color is due to Backside Metallization (BSM), which includes an Au coating to prevent oxidation while improving TIM adhesion and lowering thermal impedance. We also see quite a few empty spots for capacitors, which is interesting and could imply heftier designs down the road.

(The author is also an executive producer on the series, while Ryan Condal and Miguel Sapochnik are co-showrunners.)  \u201cWe are beyond proud of what the entire House of the Dragon team has accomplished with season 1,\u201d Francesca Orsi, executive vice president of HBO programming, said in a statement. \u201cOur phenomenal cast and crew undertook a massive challenge and exceeded all expectations, delivering a show that has already established itself as must-see-TV. A huge thank you to George, Ryan, and Miguel for leading us on this journey. We couldn\u2019t be more excited to continue bringing to life the epic saga of House Targaryen with season two.\u201d While the premise for the next season remains unconfirmed, we can expect a dive deeper into the history of House Targaryen and the civil war called the Dance of Dragons, just as in the show\u2019s source material, Martin\u2019s Fire & Blood.

Now that it's being made for Netflix, Lawrence said there are \"always discussions about rating and tone,\" but he is feeling free to execute on his own vision. \"I certainly have not felt stifled in any way, or sent in any directions with Netflix,\" he said, adding that the key creative team can basically do \"what we want to do\" with the movie.

As for a status update on how the BioShock movie is progressing through development, Lawrence said Green is in the middle of writing the movie.

While investigating the events that led to their mentor's demise, the heroes become embroiled in an ancient conflict between two secret organizations fighting for control of Gotham: the Court of Owls and the League of Shadows.  Gameplay is presented from the third-person perspective with a primary focus on using each playable character's traversal and combat abilities to defeat enemies and explore the environment. Players can freely move around Gotham City, interacting with characters, undertaking missions, and gaining experience points and other resources to level up their characters and equipment. Outside of the story, players are able to complete side missions to unlock additional content and collectible items. A cooperative online multiplayer mode is also included, allowing two players to play through the single-player campaign together while progressing in their own game.

It's frustratingly inferior to those years-old games despite its attempts to mirror the Arkham combat. Like so many games that transition into open world RPGs with skill trees and levels and missions and crafting, it takes the resourcefulness and strengths of being Batman and scatters them across a big map for you to accrue over hours and hours of play. And it splits them up between individual heroes. Robin's skill tree has the Batman where you can string up an enemy from a vantage point, but the ability to place elemental-based mines is in another tree. And Batgirl can't do that move at all. Instead of building up an all-powerful arsenal of tools and attacks, each character was only a fraction of the Batman I know.\u00a0 As a recreation of what made the other games great, it's a failure. Gotham Knights' attempt to translate Arkham into an online co-op game fragments great design into jagged pieces for the cheap dopamine hit of gradual progression. Early on, Batgirl, Robin, Nightwing, and Red Hood are effectively Batman lite, but in four different sizes. Because they're interchangeable, they all have the same goal\u2014to follow the conspiracy that Batman was chasing before he died\u2014and all the same basic skills needed to do the job.\u00a0 Their conversations are punctuation between the open world segments and setup for your next mission.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.1167881712,"EM Noise_100":0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

He resigned from the land agents, and in March travelled to England to join his mother and Lucy at Agnes's funeral. He never again lived in Ireland, and did not visit it for twenty-nine years.[2]  Initially, Shaw refused to seek clerical employment in London. His mother allowed him to live free of charge in her house in South Kensington, but he nevertheless needed an income. He had abandoned a teenage ambition to become a painter, and had not yet thought of writing for a living, but Lee found a little work for him, ghost-writing a musical column printed under Lee's name in a satirical weekly, The Hornet.[2] Lee's relations with Bessie deteriorated after their move to London.[n 6] Shaw maintained contact with Lee, who found him work as a rehearsal pianist and occasional singer.[21][n 7]  Eventually Shaw was driven to applying for office jobs. In the interim he secured a reader's pass for the British Museum Reading Room (the forerunner of the British Library) and spent most weekdays there, reading and writing.[25] His first attempt at drama, begun in 1878, was a blank-verse satirical piece on a religious theme.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.6598016024,"EM Noise_100":0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

{"Query":"Which team will Kyle Busch join in 2023?","Correct Answer":["Richard Childress Racing"],"Noise_0 Predicted Answer":"Richard Childress Racing","Noise_0 Document Index":"0","Noise_0 Document":"By Alex Zietlow  Kyle Busch is moving from one storied racing team to another. The multi-time NASCAR Cup Series champion will join Richard Childress Racing in 2023, according to a report from Jordan Bianchi of The Athletic. The move ends a successful 15-year tenure with Joe Gibbs Racing. An official announcement is expected Tuesday, per the report. The news punctuates an eventful and \u201cstressful\u201d regular season for Busch, whose free agency dominated headlines and clouded a playoff-caliber season in 2022. It did so because his looming free agency revealed a strange reality in NASCAR economics \u2014 that one of the sport\u2019s biggest stars would have to struggle to find a home (even with taking a pay cut) because of something outside of his control. That \u201csomething\u201d outside of his control, in this case, was the result of the Mars Inc. decision to exit NASCAR at the end of the year, leaving Joe Gibbs Racing (Busch\u2019s current team) without a primary sponsor for Busch\u2019s No. 18 team. Busch confirmed to reporters earlier this month that he had \u201cmore than one\u201d team extend official contract offers to him. RCR was among those companies, per reports at the time. He also said that his uncertain future had been weighing on him. \u201cIt weighs on you every time, every day of the week,\u201d Busch said at NASCAR\u2019s playoff media day before the race at Darlington.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":1.0000001192,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Richard Childress Racing","Noise_20 Document Index":"2","Noise_20 Document":"36  Editor\u2019s Note: This story is included in The Athletic\u2019s Best of 2022.

In 2011, Childress got into an altercation with Busch in the garage at Kansas Speedway that resulted in NASCAR fining Childress $150,000 and placing him on probation for the rest of the season. Asked at Kansas this past weekend how he could consider driving for Childress considering their history, Busch said: \u201cThe first time I sat down with him everything was OK and the biggest thing about it was just having the opportunity to put that behind us.\u201d The inability of JGR to secure a primary sponsor and the lengthy negotiations leading to a new home for Busch in the Cup Series had taken a visible toll on the Las Vegas native in recent weeks. In an interview last month at Watkins Glen, Busch said whatever he decided \u201cthere\u2019s a big change coming\u201d. \u201cIs it worth it to go run around and not have an opportunity to win right away versus building something versus jumping in something that can win?

So we can\u2019t ignore the significance of cloud cybersecurity moving forward as we continue to go completely digital in so many aspects of our lives. Cybersecurity companies are fighting for market share as data breaches and ransomware attacks become more common, more damaging and more expensive. With many companies turning towards cloud technology, it\u2019s no secret that companies like Google, Amazon and Microsoft are going to increase focus on this business sector. That said, Google\u2019s recent acquisition of the cyber security company, Mandiant, has stirred up a lot of conversation about the future of cloud cybersecurity and the highly competitive landscape therein. We\u2019re going to look at this space to see how much money the big players are making. It was announced on September 12 that Google\u2019s $5.4 billion bid to acquire the cybersecurity firm Mandiant was completed. Mandiant will be joining Google\u2019s cloud computing division so Google can attempt to compete with Amazon\u2019s AWS and Microsoft\u2019s Azure. This is Google\u2019s second-largest acquisition as the company aims to focus on enhancing its security operations suite and advisory services. With companies worldwide facing cyberattacks, the cloud cybersecurity space is expanding, and fast. With over 17 years of experience, Mandiant is a publicly-traded cybersecurity company that rose to prominence by discovering the SolarWinds attack where 18,000 clients unknowingly downloaded malware.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.9275108576,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"$5.4 billion","Noise_20 Document Index":"5","Noise_20 Document":"Google (GOOG, GOOGL) is finally sounding off on its blockbuster $5.4 billion acquisition of cybersecurity firm Mandiant, expressing the extent of the company's ambitions in the sector. The mega-deal was all about strengthening Google's capabilities in detecting cyber threats \u2013 something Mandiant has become well-known for, said Google Cloud Chief Information Security Officer Phil Venables at a press conference yesterday. \u201cI want to emphasize that this is adding more frontline threat intelligence,\u201d Venables said. \u201cWhen you look at what we\u2019ve got existing at Google, which includes very complementary things from VirusTotal and our other threat intelligence capabilities, bringing that together really gives us this kind of end-to-end security operations stack. Again, Google Cloud is already strong when we think about how we analyze data and put it in context, and that only gets stronger with Mandiant.\u201d Venables was very clear that Google Cloud's ambitions in cybersecurity are massive, but on some level, the size of the deal already said it all. The acquisition is Google's second-largest ever, surpassed only by the company's $12.5 billion buyout of Motorola ten years ago. The more than $5 billion the company spent on Mandiant overshadows even what Google shelled out for Fitbit, which it bought for $2.1 billion.

Shortcuts This is the first Nintendo Switch game that costs $69.99, or \u00a359.99 in the UK, both in physical and digital form. While that's disappointing, it was inevitably going to happen at some point, as that's already the price for many PS5 and Xbox Series X|S games.

They're out now as well, though they're hard to find in stock.  One of the benefits a Nintendo Switch Online membership is that it lets you use Game Vouchers. The idea is, you buy a pair of game vouchers for $99.98, and you can use them on eligible digital games on the eShop, effectively making each game cost $49.99.  Since The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom normally costs $69.99, using a voucher basically gets you a $20 discount. Not too shabby if you're an NSO member looking to buy the game in digital format.  Nintendo has released a collector's edition of the game for $129.99.

Behind the scenes, the sequel was written by Jen D'Angelo and was originally set to be directed by Adam Shankman. Following a scheduling conflict (thanks to Shankman's work on Disenchanted), Anne Fletcher took over but Shankman stayed on as executive producer. Along with the official announcement in May 2021, we got our first plot details about what we can expect from the sequel. \"Three young women accidentally bring the Sanderson Sisters back to modern-day Salem and must figure out how to stop the child-hungry witches from wreaking a new kind of havoc on the world,\" it reads. This does sound a little bit like the book sequel that was released in July 2018 which centred on Max and Allison's daughter Poppy, her friend Travis and a girl called Isabella who Poppy has a crush on. In order to impress Isabella, Poppy sneaks into the Sanderson house during a blood moon and accidentally brings the sisters back to life. It's unclear if this is exactly what will happen in the movie sequel, so might end up being non-canon.

Diversity And Inclusion To foster a really inclusive culture in our field, we particularly encourage submissions from members of underrepresented groups in computational linguistics, i.e., researchers from any demographic or geographic minority, researchers with disabilities, among others. The overall diversity of the tutorial organizers and potential audience will be taken into account to ensure that the conference program is varied and balanced.  Tutorial proposals should describe and will be evaluated according to how the tutorial contributes to topics promoting diversity (e.g., working on minority languages, developing NLP for good), participation diversity (e.g., coordinating with social affinity groups, providing subsidies, making a promotional plan for the tutorial), and representation diversity among tutorial presenters. For more information or advice, organizers may consult resources such as the BIG directory, Black in AI, {Dis}ability in AI, Indigenous AI, LatinX in AI, Masakhane, 500 Queer Scientists, and Women-in-ML\u2019s directory.   Submission Details Proposals should use the ACL paper submission format.

Submissions with \u201cplaceholder\u201d abstracts will be removed without consideration. Important: if you miss the abstract submission deadline, then you cannot submit the full paper. Mandatory Discussion of Limitations We believe that it is also important to discuss the limitations of your work, in addition to its strengths. EMNLP 2023 requires all papers to have a clear discussion of limitations, in a dedicated section titled \u201cLimitations\u201d. This section will appear at the end of the paper, after the discussion\/conclusions section and before the references, and will not count towards the page limit. Papers without a limitation section will be automatically rejected without review. ARR-reviewed paper that did not include \u201cLimitations\u201d section in their prior submission, should submit a PDF with such a section together with their EMNLP 2023 submission.

After the abstract submission deadline, the form will change and some fields will become mandatory. The ARR commitment link is available. The 2023 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP 2023) invites the submission of long and short papers on substantial, original, and unpublished research on empirical methods for Natural Language Processing. As in recent years, some of the presentations at the conference will be for papers accepted by the Transactions of the ACL (TACL) and Computational Linguistics (CL) journals. EMNLP 2023 will follow EMNLP 2022 and ACL 2023 and go with a hybrid format with respect to ARR. This means that while EMNLP will accept ARR-reviewed papers, it will also accept submissions directly to EMNLP through the OpenReview system. However, in order to keep the review load on the community as a whole manageable, we need to ask authors to decide up-front if they want to be reviewed through ARR or EMNLP.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.1052304208,"EM Noise_100":0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

The state funeral was the largest security operation ever mounted in the UK, and included dignitaries from around the world. The funeral was designated as a public holiday in the UK and several Commonwealth states. The state funeral was one of the United Kingdom's most watched special television broadcasts, surpassing the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton, the previous most watched royal event of the 21st century. The period of official mourning and the funeral was estimated to have cost the government \u00a3162 million.[1]  Queen Elizabeth II was in good health for most of her life; her health, however, declined significantly after the death of her husband, Prince Philip, in April 2021.[2] She began to use a walking stick for public engagements in October 2021.[3] On 20 October, the Queen stayed overnight in King Edward VII's Hospital in central London, necessitating the cancellation of scheduled visits to Northern Ireland and the COP26 summit in Glasgow. She suffered a sprained back in November, which prevented her from attending the 2021 National Service of Remembrance.[4][5][6][7]  In February 2022, during the COVID-19 pandemic in England, the Queen was one of several people at Windsor Castle to test positive for COVID-19.","Jaccard Noise_20":0.0,"Cosine Noise_20":0.8658117056,"EM Noise_20":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":0,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"Monday","Noise_40 Document Index":"6","Noise_40 Document":"Britain bid farewell to Queen Elizabeth II on Monday with a majestic funeral steeped in tradition and a send-off reflective of the broad popularity she managed to retain over her remarkable seven-decade reign.

LONDON (AP) \u2014 The United Kingdom and the world bade farewell to Queen Elizabeth II on Monday with a state funeral that drew presidents and kings, princes and prime ministers \u2014 and crowds in the streets of London and at Windsor Castle \u2014 to honor a monarch whose 70-year reign defined an age. In a country known for pomp and pageantry, the first state funeral since Winston Churchill\u2019s was filled with spectacle: Before the service, a bell tolled 96 times \u2014 once a minute for each year of Elizabeth\u2019s life. Then, 142 Royal Navy sailors used ropes to draw the gun carriage carrying her flag-draped coffin to Westminster Abbey, where pallbearers carried it inside and about 2,000 people ranging from world leaders to health care workers gathered to mourn.  The trappings of state and monarchy abounded: The coffin was draped with the Royal Standard and atop it was the Imperial State Crown, sparkling with almost 3,000 diamonds, and the sovereign\u2019s orb and scepter. But the personal was also present: The coffin was followed into the church by generations of Elizabeth\u2019s descendants, including King Charles III, heir to the throne Prince William and 9-year-old George, who is second in line.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.5493694544,"EM Noise_100":0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

Her death was publicly announced at 18:30. She was succeeded by her eldest son, Charles III.  The death of Queen Elizabeth II set in motion Operation London Bridge, a collection of plans including arrangements for her state funeral, and supported by Operation Unicorn, which set protocols for her death occurring in Scotland. The United Kingdom observed a national mourning period of 10 days. The Queen's lying in state took place in Westminster Hall from 14 to 19\u00a0September, during which time an estimated 250,000 people queued to pay their respects.  Elizabeth's state funeral on 19 September was the first held in Britain since Winston Churchill's in 1965. A funeral service was held at Westminster Abbey, followed by a procession to Wellington Arch that featured around 3,000 military personnel and was watched by around a million people in central London. The state hearse then transported the Queen's coffin to Windsor, followed by another procession through Windsor Great Park and a committal service at St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.3333333333,"Cosine Noise_0":0.8206947446,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":0,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Westminster Abbey","Noise_20 Document Index":"1","Noise_20 Document":"Given the hours and reams of media coverage of the death of Queen Elizabeth II\u00a0in recent days, it's almost surprising to learn that her funeral on Monday is still a mystery to millions in the USA.\u00a0 Nevertheless, the gods of Google insist multiple questions are trending about the funeral.

Hard-right leader Giorgia Meloni was sworn in as Italy\u2019s first female prime minister amid looming questions over her coalition partners\u2019 stance towards Russia. The 45-year-old leader recited the ritual oath of office before Italian President Sergio Mattarella on Saturday after her party Brothers of Italy won more than 25 percent of the vote in snap elections in late September. She pledged to act \u201cin the exclusive interests of the nation\u201d \u2013 a promise then repeated by her 24 ministers, six of them women. The ceremony took place a day after Meloni along with her coalition partners \u2013 hardliner Matteo Salvini of the League party and Forza Italia\u2019s TV tycoon Silvio Berlusconi \u2013 unveiled their cabinet. The government is expected to face confidence votes in parliament next week. Forza Italia\u2019s Antonio Tajani is now the country\u2019s foreign minister. He has a long history with European institutions and was president of the European Parliament in 2017. The economy ministry will be in the hands of League\u2019s Giancarlo Giorgetti who is considered relatively pro-Europe, and one of the most moderate among party members. Another key department, the defence ministry, is going to Brothers of Italy\u2019s co-founder and close adviser to Meloni Guido Crosetto \u2013 a defence industry expert who was head of the Federation of Italian Aerospace Companies.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.9999998808,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Giorgia Meloni","Noise_20 Document Index":"0","Noise_20 Document":"Populist firebrand Giorgia Meloni has been named as Italy\u2019s first female prime minister, becoming the country\u2019s most far-right leader since Benito Mussolini.

By Radhika Seth On June 12, 2023, after enduring years of controversy, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the organization that founded the Golden Globes, announced that it would be closing. However, it seems this is not the end for the famously raucous ceremony, which has kicked off awards season for the past 80 years. Here\u2019s everything you need to know about the 2024 Golden Globe Awards, and how we ended up here. By all accounts, yes. Eldridge Industries, a holding company owned by the billionaire investor Todd Boehly, and Dick Clark Productions, which has produced the Golden Globes telecast for decades, have reportedly agreed to purchase the HFPA\u2019s Golden Globes assets, rights, and properties for an undisclosed price. They\u2019ll form a new non-profit, the Golden Globe Foundation, which will continue the philanthropic work of the HFPA. (The organization has given more than $50 million to entertainment-related charities over the last 30 years.) Meanwhile, a yet-to-be-named for-profit entity will also seek to expand the Golden Globes as a brand.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.5860193372,"EM Noise_100":0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

SEOUL, South Korea -- Former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was assassinated during a campaign speech on Friday. He was 67. Abe was in the city of Nara in western Japan giving a speech in support of his party's candidates in the upcoming upper house elections when he was suddenly gunned down. He was airlifted to a hospital where he was later pronounced dead, according to hospital officials. Nara prefectural police arrested the alleged gunman -- identified as 41-year-old Tetsuya Yamagami -- and recovered a weapon -- described as a handmade shotgun -- at the scene of the attack on Friday, according to Japanese public broadcaster NHK, a partner of ABC News. The attack and a motive remains under investigation, but police said the suspect told investigators that he was dissatisfied with the former prime minister and intended to kill him, according to NHK. Funeral plans for Abe have not yet been announced. The deadly shooting shocked many in Japan and around the globe. Japan is one of the world's safest countries and has some of the strictest gun control laws.

The channel's most successful comedy since Father Ted, the series was inspired by McGee's own experiences growing up in Derry, Northern Ireland, in the 1990s, during the final years of the Troubles.[5] It stars Saoirse-Monica Jackson, Louisa Harland, Nicola Coughlan, Jamie-Lee O'Donnell, and Dylan Llewellyn as five teenagers living in mid-1990s Derry while attending Our Lady Immaculate College, a fictional girls' Catholic secondary school based on the real-life Thornhill College, where McGee herself studied.[6][7] Produced by British production company Hat Trick Productions, Derry Girls is filmed in Northern Ireland, with most scenes shot on location in Derry and some in Belfast.  Although the plot lines of Derry Girls are fictional, the series frequently references actual events of the Troubles and the Northern Ireland peace process, including the 1994 IRA ceasefire announcement, the 1995 visit to Northern Ireland of President Bill Clinton and First Lady Hillary Clinton, and the Good Friday referendum of 1998.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.5728625059,"EM Noise_100":0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

It also costs $1,600 for the Founders Edition, but you\u2019ll find many versions of the card up for sale for $2,000 to $2,500. Nvidia\u2019s choice to price the RTX 4090 the way it did was not the most popular decision it has ever made. After a couple of years of GPU shortage, most of us are tired of having to pay insane prices for our PC hardware. To see Nvidia not just continue that trend, but also tell its customers outright that cheaper GPUs are a thing of the past, was disheartening. Still, the RTX 4090 sold out and came back at scalper prices, with some eBay sales on launch day reaching as high as $5,000. There was a single sale for $9,999, but it\u2019s hard to believe that this was a legitimate purchase. The insanity of these prices made some of us actually look forward to the (also overpriced) RTX 4080, set with an MSRP (recommended price) of $1,200.

Of course, scalpers tried their luck with the new Ada cards too, and while they were successful with the 4090, it seems that their success with the 4080 has been moderate at best so far. We only really have sales data from eBay, but let\u2019s see how these numbers compare. Since the launch of the RTX 4090 on October 12, a total of 3,050 units have been sold through the U.S. version of eBay, at an average price of $2,328. It\u2019s barely worth it to resell these cards right now. Around the time of the RTX 4080 launch (November 16), the sales of the 4090 started rising and have been on a steady, albeit slow, rise ever since. The prices are now close to what they were around the time of launch. The RTX 4080 is not doing so well. Only 281 units have been sold since November 16, at an average price of $1,496. For scalpers, this means that the sales are just about enough to break even when you consider shipping and fees.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.6476649642,"EM Noise_100":0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

Previously he served as chancellor of the Exchequer (2020\u201322). Sunak was born into a family with immigrant roots. His grandparents emigrated from Punjab, in northwestern India, to East Africa, where his mother and father were born in Tanzania and Kenya, respectively.\u00a0 They met and married after their families migrated in the 1960s to\u00a0Southampton in southern England. Sunak\u2019s father became a general practitioner for the National Health Service. His mother, a pharmacist, owned and operated a small pharmacy, for which Sunak, the eldest of their three children, would eventually keep the books. Later, during his political career, Sunak would draw parallels between his experiences working in the family business and the values he gained from them and those of Conservative Party icon Margaret Thatcher, the daughter of a grocer. As a result of his parents\u2019 sacrifices and saving to fund his education, Sunak was able to attend Winchester College, the exclusive private school that has produced no fewer than six chancellors of the Exchequer.","Jaccard Noise_40":0.0,"Cosine Noise_40":0.4605405629,"EM Noise_40":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":0,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"Tuesday","Noise_60 Document Index":"5","Noise_60 Document":"Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(Oct. 25) LONDON (AP) \u2014 Rishi Sunak became Britain\u2019s third prime minister this year on Tuesday, tasked with taming an economic crisis that has left the country\u2019s finances in a precarious state and millions struggling to pay their food and energy bills. Sunak, who is the U.K.\u2019s first leader of color, met King Charles III at Buckingham Palace, where the monarch officially asked the new leader of the governing Conservative Party to form a government, as is tradition. Sunak clinched the leadership position Monday, seen by his party as a safe pair of hands to stabilize an economy sliding toward recession \u2014 and stem its own plunging popularity, after the brief, disastrous term of Liz Truss.  Her package of unfunded tax cuts spooked financial markets with the prospect of ballooning debt, drove the pound to record lows and forced the Bank of England to intervene \u2014 weakening Britain\u2019s fragile economy and obliterating Truss\u2019 authority within her party.

Tennant and Catherine Tate will return to Doctor Who for three special episodes, set to air in November 2023 to mark the show's 60th anniversary.","Jaccard Noise_80":0.0,"Cosine Noise_80":0.3330280781,"EM Noise_80":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":0,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"Sarah-Jane Smith","Noise_100 Document Index":"3","Noise_100 Document":"While it's true that most of the series' companions go on to form a special bond with their respective Doctor or Doctors, none quite compare to the one shared by Rose and the tenth Doctor. It's incredibly well-written and provides viewers with a glimpse of the Doctor's human side. Even before that though, Rose had a big impact on the series. Being the first companion of the modern era of Doctor Who may have phased some, but Billie Piper takes to the role like a duck to water. Rose's outgoing personality helped to bring balance to Eccleston's sullen and serious interpretation of the Doctor, while also playing a key, albeit, questionable, role in the events of the first series' climax.  Sarah-Jane Smith is easily the most popular companion of the classic era of Doctor Who and even returned for several of the modern episodes. She was first introduced as a traveling partner for the third Doctor back in 1973 though, before eventually going on to interact with eight of the other 12 doctors in some way, shape, or form. She was there when Davros created the Daleks on Skaro and came up against many of the series' most iconic villains at one point or another. Such was her popularity with series fans that Sarah-Jane even got her own spin-off series called The Sarah-Jane Adventures, which ran for five full seasons before Elisabeth Sladen's untimely death in 2011.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.4239652455,"EM Noise_100":0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

Ahead of Naomi Biden's wedding to Peter Neal, speculation over what designer President Biden's granddaughter would pick to design her wedding dress was high.  Would it be Ralph Lauren, the quintessential American designer, who invited Naomi to their Fall\/Winter 2022 fashion show? Would it be Valentino, who dressed Naomi for President Biden's inauguration night last year? Or perhaps Reem Acra, a favorite of her grandmother, First Lady Jill Biden, or maybe her former employer Tom Ford (she interned for the brand in college)? Now we know: Naomi Biden wore Ralph Lauren at her South Lawn wedding ceremony. She looked elegant in a long-sleeved gown, with a long veil and train. She kept her accessories simple, wearing a pair of Tiffany diamond and pearl drop earrings, and carried a bouquet of white flowers. Her wedding band was Tiffany as well\u2014as was Neal's band. He paired it with a Schlumberger single daisy brooch. First Lady Jill Biden's outfit kept to her classic style: she wore a teal wool crepe coat and a blue silk chiffon dress designed by Reem Acra.

Granted that revival retcons the Criminal Minds finale in several ways, it's essentially the same thing. That being said, Paramount+ just cannot simply use the title Criminal Minds season 16 because the project is different in a couple of significant ways from its original run. That includes veering away from its episodic storytelling format to a more serialized one, not to mention being darker and more disturbing than CBS' iteration. By giving the Criminal Minds revival a new title, Paramount+ allows it to be both a reboot and a continuation of the CBS series. Calling it Criminal Minds season 16 could also be confusing if the project doesn\u2019t address every single plot line that the finale left loose, which puts a lot of burden on the new series. Having its official title of Criminal Minds: Evolution quickly establishes that the show is part of the Criminal Minds brand, which could entice some formers fans to check it out, especially those who haven\u2019t been keeping track of Paramount+\u2019s efforts to bring back the BAU on the small screen.

On top of that, the K-pop label also plans to kickstart retail businesses in Singapore, including cafes, merchandise stores, pop-up stores, and more. Moreover, the company will not limit its expansion to Singapore but wants to establish itself in the Middle East too. As per CNBC, the Singapore headquarters will also overlook ventures in Indonesia, Vietnam, and Thailand, while simultaneously communicating with the Korea office. For a wider reach in Asia, SM Entertainment is going beyond the Korean borders to establish its Southeast Asia headquarters in Singapore. Although the company has not shared the financial details of the Singapore venture, they plan to hire locals to grow their staff count in the country. Moreover, they are planning to recruit undergraduates or fresh graduates for internships. In his interview with CNBC, Lee Soo-man, founder of SM Entertainment, said his team likes to nurture talent through the Cultural Technology system he developed years ago. The systematic K-pop training system, started by Lee Soo-man, allows singers and dancers to excel in four stages: casting, training, marketing\/management, and producing. Additionally, he has been determined to produce another NCT subunit, NCT Singapore, if the opportunity comes.","Jaccard Noise_40":1.0,"Cosine Noise_40":0.9999999404,"EM Noise_40":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":1,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"Singapore","Noise_60 Document Index":"0","Noise_60 Document":"Nov 30, 2022 ...

Along with additional antitrust lawsuits, the organization is also just starting to defend against multiple attempts to reclassify some college athletes as employees of their schools. That combination is likely to leave a new president unable to make rules that slow down the money that boosters and schools are steering into the pockets of athletes while also trying to convince the National Labor Relations Board that those same athletes are students rather than workers in a multibillion dollar industry. Managing the would-be employers in that equation won't be a simple task either. The richest and most powerful conferences in schools have already started to question if they still fit comfortably in the confines of the NCAA's current top division. Those entities will only become richer and powerful during a new president's tenure as they sign new media rights contracts and potentially revamp the College Football Playoff -- two decisions over which the NCAA president has no control.","Jaccard Noise_60":0.0,"Cosine Noise_60":0.4816972017,"EM Noise_60":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_60":0,"Noise_80 Predicted Answer":"Charlie Baker","Noise_80 Document Index":"5","Noise_80 Document":"Mar 24, 2023 ...

The inequities between the men and women were obvious and stark, which put the NCAA into damage-control mode. At that point, those in the women's basketball world had to question if Emmert was very sincere in his concern, but there was a \"better-late-than-never\" sentiment. And the NCAA's decision to commission the so-called Kaplan report, which did a deep dive into inequities in all men's and women's NCAA championships, was an important step because it didn't pull any punches about how significant those issues have been. The report also said the NCAA has been selling women's sports short regarding potential television revenue. When it's time to negotiate TV rights again, rather than selling multiple championships in a bargain bundle, the NCAA needs to think bigger about the worth of each championship and how best to maximize revenue from it. Also, the NCAA has to show more leadership regarding the inclusion of transgender athletes in competition. As with so many things, the NCAA has been behind on this. Dave Wilson: The next leader is going to have to get creative to figure out the mess of issues currently embroiling college sports, or finally just step out of the way and put on tournaments.

DreamWorks had advertised heavily during the holiday 2001 season for Shrek, but was disappointed when the rumored Best Picture nomination did not materialize, though it was nominated for and ultimately won the inaugural Best Animated Feature award.[1]  The criticism surrounding the Best Animated Feature category was particularly prominent at the 81st Academy Awards, in which WALL-E won the award but was not nominated for Best Picture, despite receiving widespread acclaim from critics and audiences alike and being generally considered to be one of the best films of 2008.[19][20][21][22] This sparked controversy over whether the film was deliberately snubbed of such nomination by the Academy.

The haunting stop-motion musical fantasy was inspired by the 1883 Italian novel \"The Adventures of Pinocchio\" by Carlo Collodi, and informed by Gris Grimly's illustrations of the 2002 edition of the book. Del Toro, 58, reimagines the classic story of Pinocchio, a wooden puppet who dreams of being a real boy, who is cared for by carver Geppetto. However, the story of the Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) film is set in Fascist Italy during the interwar period and World War Two. \"Pinocchio\" prevailed over other popular nominees A24's stop-motion film \"Marcel the Shell With Shoes On\" and the Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) 3D animated film \"Turning Red.\" Del Toro has many accolades, including his 2018 Oscar wins for best picture and best director for \"The Shape of Water.","Jaccard Noise_60":1.0,"Cosine Noise_60":0.9961767197,"EM Noise_60":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_60":1,"Noise_80 Predicted Answer":"Pinocchio","Noise_80 Document Index":"6","Noise_80 Document":"Senior Lecturer Film Studies and Media, York St John University      Keith McDonald does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.

The universe abhors a vacuum and so it is in Hollywood, where the current absence of mega-budget space operas like \"The Expanse\" and \"Dune\" has given rise to \"Rebel Moon,\" a fantastic new sci-fi project from director Zack Snyder (\"Watchmen,\" \"Man of Steel,\" \"Justice League\"), and we've got a first peek at some breathtaking concept art shared via Twitter. As revealed on Variety on Feb. 9, \"Rebel Moon\" is sci-fi saga being created for Netflix that has a definite \"Seven Samurai,\" Akira Kurosawa vibe to it and actually began life as a grand pitch for a \"Star Wars\"-based feature nearly a decade ago prior to Disney swallowing up Lucasfilm in 2012.\u00a0  Snyder co-wrote the screenplay in collaboration with Shay Hatten and Kurt Johnstad.

Space opera designed exclusively for grown-ups? That's a surefire way to put some clear space between Rebel Moon and the veteran, family-friendly franchise that inspired it.

The hearing was a rare opportunity for lawmakers to question the leader of the short-form social media video app about the company's relationship with its Chinese owner, ByteDance, and how they handle users' sensitive personal data. TikTok Chief Executive Shou Zi Chew faced roughly five hours of questioning by dozens of lawmakers in a high-stakes hearing with the House Energy and Commerce Committee on Thursday about the safety and security of the immensely popular app. Republicans and Democrats alike grilled the 40-year-old Chew about China's relationship with his company, data privacy, possible teen addiction to the app, misinformation and fentanyl. Front and center were concerns that TikTok's parent company Bytedance might be sharing data from U.S. users with the Chinese government.","Jaccard Noise_60":0.0,"Cosine Noise_60":0.5936977863,"EM Noise_60":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_60":0,"Noise_80 Predicted Answer":"Mar 16, 2023","Noise_80 Document Index":"0","Noise_80 Document":"Mar 16, 2023 ...

TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew faced four-and-a-half hours of questioning at a US congressional hearing on Thursday.  As one congressman pointed out, some people run marathons quicker than that. Mr Chew will certainly be feeling it, after a torrid time giving evidence. Many tech execs have stood before Congress, and they often don't get an easy ride.  But what was exceptional about this hearing was the stubborn, never-ending line of vicious questioning.  From both Democrats and Republicans, there was no let-up. A spokesperson for TikTok said afterwards the politicians were \"grandstanding\". There is most certainly some truth to that. But between the sometimes frustratingly verbose questioning, we did learn a thing or two.  There was criticism of TikTok from Republicans and Democrats, and the level of distrust and scepticism from all sides was stark.  \"Welcome to the most bipartisan committee in Congress,\" said Republican congressman Buddy Carter.  This video can not be played Committee chair to TikTok CEO: 'We aren't buying it' \"Thank you, Mr Chew, for bringing Republicans and Democrats together,\" said Dan Crenshaw, a Republican.

For more than three months, Google executives have watched as projects at Microsoft and a San Francisco start-up called OpenAI have stoked the public\u2019s imagination with the potential for artificial intelligence. But on Tuesday, Google tentatively stepped off the sidelines as it released a chatbot called Bard.

Still, the release represents a significant step to stave off a threat to Google\u2019s most lucrative business, its search engine.

While many of these companies boomed during the coronavirus pandemic, some of the largest ones have reported financial results in recent weeks that showed they are feeling the fallout of global economic jitters. Last week, Elon Musk, the new owner of Twitter, laid off roughly half the company\u2019s 7,500 employees, saying the social media service was losing $4 million a day. \u201cThese cycles of boom and bust are incredibly destructive within organizations because people employed there feel like they don\u2019t know where they stand,\u201d said Sandra J. Sucher, a management professor at Harvard. By rapidly hiring across all departments during the pandemic, Mr. Zuckerberg had set up his company to need reductions in staff, she said. Mr. Zuckerberg has been telegraphing that Meta will have to clamp down on costs, starting with cutting back on many of the lavish perks that employees once enjoyed. In March, he announced that the company was trimming or eliminating free services like laundry and dry cleaning. He also scaled back free dinner offerings, making it harder for employees to take home dinner for themselves and their families. In July, Mr. Zuckerberg warned employees that the company was experiencing \u201cone of the worst downturns that we\u2019ve seen in recent history,\u201d and in September he announced a hiring freeze. Last month, he warned that \u201cteams will stay flat or shrink over the next year.","Jaccard Noise_80":0.0,"Cosine Noise_80":0.7499848604,"EM Noise_80":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":0,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"87,000","Noise_100 Document Index":"7","Noise_100 Document":"His company gobbled up workers as its family of apps, which also includes WhatsApp, became popular worldwide. The coronavirus pandemic also supercharged the use of mobile apps, leading to more growth. At its peak last year, Meta had 87,000 full-time employees. But as the global economy soured, and digital advertising markets contracted last year, Mr. Zuckerberg began putting an end to unchecked growth. Meta trimmed employee perks. And after the layoffs in November, which largely affected the business divisions and recruiting teams, Mr. Zuckerberg hinted at further cuts. On an earnings call in February, the chief executive said he did not want the company to be overstuffed with a layer of middle management, or \u201cmanagers managing managers.\u201d He said he took responsibility for last year\u2019s layoffs, blaming his zeal for staffing up on the surge of use early in the pandemic. Meta\u2019s layoffs are part of a wave of job cuts from the biggest tech companies. In recent months, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Salesforce and others have also said they are trimming their ranks, and some of the companies have increased the number of people they are letting go after initial announcements. Many of the companies have cited a challenging global economic environment for their actions. But even beyond the macroeconomic conditions, Meta is dealing with many challenges.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.7167464495,"EM Noise_100":0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

If a company like Shark --which also makes robot vacuums -- acquired iRobot, he believes that's a definitive competition concern. Amazon, however, isn't a market leader in vacuum robots, making it difficult to pinpoint the competition argument, he said. \"Obviously it makes iRobot a very serious competitor, and if I was making robot vacuum cleaners, I would be nervous,\" Ray said. \"But that's not enough to trigger a competition investigation.\" Ray said that subscription revenues are becoming increasingly important for companies needing long-term commitment and revenue, and Amazon could turn its iRobot acquisition into a subscription service. \"You could imagine paying for a Roomba on a subscription whereby spare parts are automatically sent to you, new brushes are automatically sent to you, and indeed the product itself would be cheap to make up for that,\" Ray said. \"So I think they see that as going towards a subscription service.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.1169645861,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":0,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Amazon","Noise_20 Document Index":"1","Noise_20 Document":"Greiner said that iRobot and Amazon have both worked for years to build trust with their customers and that the deal could ultimately help stimulate more investment in the robotics industry. \"You do have to watch.

LLaMA's developers reported that the 13B parameter model's performance on most NLP benchmarks exceeded that of the much larger GPT-3 (with 175B parameters) and that the largest model was competitive with state of the art models such as PaLM and Chinchilla.[1] Whereas the most powerful LLMs have generally been accessible only through limited APIs (if at all), Meta released LLaMA's model weights to the research community under a noncommercial license.[2] Within a week of LLaMA's release, its weights were leaked to the public on 4chan via BitTorrent.[3]  In July 2023, Meta released several models as Llama 2, using 7, 13 and 70 billion parameters.

While there are also Asian directors and screenwriters among this year\u2019s nominees, in other respects, 2023 represents a step back from diversity for the Motion Picture Academy.

The company, called xAI, unveiled a website and a team of a dozen staffers.

Twitter announced this week it was partnering with eToro to allow users to be able to trade stocks and crypto. It should be pretty clear by now that Musk\u2019s call for a six-month pause was purely out of self interest in the AI arms race, as I wrote at the time. ChatGPT has become a fascinating tool for people who want to experiment with large language models (LLMs) that answer questions posed in natural language. But there are still a lot of kinks to be worked out, as ChatGPT will often give confident answers, even when it\u2019s wrong. AI is largely a magic trick at this point, sometimes spouting nonsense that users may not know enough about to fact-check. But it\u2019s an interesting magic trick and it\u2019s something that will improved upon as more people in the world of tech become involved.

Under an alter-ego, \"The Fury\", Ria creates films of martial arts training with the help of her older sister Lena, who has dropped out of art school and moved back in with their loving but traditional parents, Fatima and Rafe, both of them discouraging Ria's dreams.   At school, Ria is inseparable from her friends Clara and Alba, but their disapproving teacher urges her to pursue a more \"serious\" career.

Today at I\/O, we gave a sneak peek of Magic Editor, a new experimental editing experience that uses generative AI to help you reimagine your photos and make editing even easier. With Magic Editor, you\u2019ll be able to make complex edits without pro-level editing skills. Using a combination of AI techniques, including generative AI, it will help you make edits to specific parts of an image \u2014 like the subject, sky or background \u2014 so you have even more control over the final look and feel of your photo. Sometimes the difference between a so-so picture and the perfect shot comes down to getting the framing just right. Magic Editor will help you improve the overall composition of your photo by allowing you to reposition the subject of your shot to the best spot. For example, if you\u2019re trying to get the perfect photo from your time at a popular waterfall, you could remove the bag strap you forgot to take off.

OpenAI has launched an iOS app for ChatGPT, promising that an Android version is coming \u201csoon.\u201d The app is free to use, syncs chat history with the web, and features voice input, supported by OpenAI\u2019s open-source speech recognition model Whisper. The app works on both iPhones and iPads and can be downloaded from the App Store here. OpenAI says it\u2019s rolling out the app in the US first and will expand to other countries \u201cin the coming weeks.\u201d OpenAI didn\u2019t previously hint that a mobile app was coming, but it makes sense given the incredible popularity of ChatGPT. The AI chatbot launched last November but rocketed in use. Some outside estimates suggest the app attracted 100 million users by January this year, though OpenAI has never confirmed these figures.  The app\u2019s launch is interesting, considering OpenAI\u2019s somewhat ambivalent approach to positioning ChatGPT in the market.

Apple Vision Pro is priced starting at $3,499 and it is set to launch in early 2024. It will be available on Apple.com when it launches, and in stores only in the United States to begin with. Note: See an error in this roundup or want to offer feedback? Send us an email here. Apple Vision Pro is a \"mixed reality\" headset, meaning it can display both virtual and augmented reality content. It is not like augmented reality glasses, however, as it is designed to completely cover the eyes and block out all of your surroundings.   Apple is using exterior and interior cameras for the augmented reality component of the device. The cameras are able to map the space around you and project the real world back to you, so though you're not actually looking at what's around you using see-through glasses, you are effectively seeing an accurate picture of your real world environment.  With this capability, Apple can show you 3D windows, objects, and content in your actual space, or the cameras can be turned off to shut out the world to provide an entirely virtual setting. Apple is focusing on the headset's ability to allow for working, content consumption, gaming, communication and other activities to be done \"anywhere\" with just the Vision Pro.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":1.0,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"$3,499","Noise_20 Document Index":"3","Noise_20 Document":"By  Adi Robertson, a senior tech and policy editor focused on VR, online platforms, and free expression.

Vision Pro is positioned as primarily an AR device, but it can switch between augmented and full virtual reality using a dial.  The device is controller-free, and you browse rows of app icons in an operating system called visionOS by looking at them. You can tap to select and flick to scroll, you can also give voice commands, and Apple says \u201chundreds of thousands of familiar iPhone and iPad apps\u201d will automatically work that way.

Pricing and Availability Apple Vision Pro starts at $3,499 (U.S.), and will be available early next year on apple.com and at Apple Store locations in the U.S., with more countries coming later next year. Customers will be able to learn about, experience, and personalize their fit for Vision Pro at Apple Store locations. For more information about Vision Pro, visit apple.com\/apple-vision-pro.

Apple plans to charge $3,499 for the Vision Pro when it launches in 2024, but the company wants to create a model that has a lower cost to broaden the appeal of the device. Apple engineers plan to use more affordable components to bring the price down, but the lower-priced headset will have the same general AR\/VR \"mixed reality\" functionality of the Vision Pro. The chips in the device will be on par with the iPhone rather than the Mac-level chips used in the first AR\/VR headset, and Apple may also use lower resolution internal displays and cheaper materials. As of right now, development on the more affordable headset is in the early stages and Apple has not created a working prototype. Foxconn is already working on a lower-cost headset, and rumors right now suggest it could come in late 2025 at the earliest.  According to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the second-generation Vision Pro will be available in both high-end and low-end models, similar to the iPhone. Apple is expected to offer a more affordable model and a follow up to the higher-end and more expensive first-generation model. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes that Apple could be planning augmented reality \"contact lenses\" that could launch sometime in the 2030s.","Jaccard Noise_80":1.0,"Cosine Noise_80":1.0,"EM Noise_80":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":1,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"$3,500","Noise_100 Document Index":"5","Noise_100 Document":"Jun 11, 2023 ...

Maven founder and CEO Kate Ryder joined Scarlet Fu, Bloomberg Television and Bloomberg QuickTake host, for an online talk on Thursday, September 30, as part of the Cornell Tech @ Bloomberg Speaker Series. She shared the story of her career transition from journalism to venture capitalist to entrepreneurship, the birth of her startup, and the lessons she\u2019s learned on the road to building a company valued at more than $1 billion. Ryder is a born storyteller, having begun her career as a journalist, writing about finance and business. One of her earliest breaks was ghostwriting the memoir of former U.S. Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, which dealt with Paulson\u2019s experience during the financial crisis of 2008. \u201cSo much about entrepreneurship is figuring out the signal in the noise,\u201d says Ryder, comparing her recent career as a CEO to her start in journalism.

A notable difference: Rice accomplished all of those things in a whole career, while Kupp did it in one season.  Set a record for receptions (33) and tied for the second-most receiving yards (478) and receiving touchdowns (6) in a postseason in NFL history. Caught a touchdown in each of the Rams' four postseason games, making him the second player in league history to do that in a single postseason, along with former Arizona Cardinals wideout Larry Fitzgerald. Joined former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Joe Montana as the only players to win Offensive Player of the Year and Super Bowl MVP in the same season. Became the first player to lead the league in receiving and win a Super Bowl since Rice in 1994. When it was over and his vision had become reality, Kupp struggled to find words on the podium. Even as he sat with his son and had more time to reflect, he was still overcome by the emotions of his own manifestation.","Jaccard Noise_20":0.0,"Cosine Noise_20":0.2939629257,"EM Noise_20":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":0,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"Cooper Kupp","Noise_40 Document Index":"5","Noise_40 Document":"\ud83d\udcfa: #SBLVI on NBC \ud83d\udcf1: https:\/\/t.co\/K02y40b5Nu pic.twitter.com\/vhHjVNRsnC MORE: Cooper Kupp stats: Where does Rams receiver's historic season rank in NFL history Kupp was also instrumental in the Rams' final go-ahead drive: He converted fourth-and-1 at the Rams' 37 with a 7-yard end-around and also caught three passes for 38 yards prior to his game-winning catch.
