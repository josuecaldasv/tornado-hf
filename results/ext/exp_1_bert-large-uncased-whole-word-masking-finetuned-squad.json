Every now and then, one tries to be both (and fails). Good Sam falls very much into the Grey's Anatomy category, complete with a main character forced to live in the shadow of their larger than life parent. In this case, Sam's father is like Dr House: abrasive, cocky, mean and of course the most brilliant person in the room. Because that's not enough, he also has cancer. You know, like New Amsterdam's hero. So, yeah, it's not the most original pilot script. To be fair, Good Sam certainly isn't the most egregious of the Grey's wannabes. It doesn't rely on love stories nearly as much, at least initially. Sam has a boyfriend at the beginning, but then she doesn't anymore. And although there's another character she could fall in love with, that's not the main focus.

What microchip shortage? EV maker Tesla, which it should be pointed out produces its own chips in-house, seems not to have been bothered by supply-chain issues all that much in 2021, delivering 936,172 vehicles in the year just ended, according to a report by finance news outlet Finbold. That represents a healthy 87 percent increase over 2020, when the company handed over 499,550 Teslas to customers. Even better for the company, it ended the year with a bang, racking up a record number of sales in the last quarter of 2021, or 308,600 units. Most of that total consisted of Model 3 and Model Y models, no surprise. It\u2019s the sixth consecutive quarter that it breaks its record for sales. In 2019, the automaker delivered 367,500 units, so annual sales growth, while not exponential, is clearly accelerating. The company has said in the past that one its main goals is to attain 50 percent sales growth year after year. Once upon a time, Tesla struggled mightily to hit its delivery targets, but no more. There\u2019s also no sign of that growth slowing down any time soon, even as all-electric rivals join the market by the month.

The most popular vehicle of the year proved Model 3s, comprising over 95% of produced and delivered cars. The Q4 deliveries and production could have been more impressive. Their numbers fell short of analysts\u2019 consensus, who expected Tesla to deliver around 427,000 cars. Contrary to analysts\u2019 predictions, Tesla delivered 405,278 vehicles and produced 439,000 cars in the fourth quarter. The period ending December 31, 2022, was challenging for the company because of Covid outbreaks in China, leading to reduced production at its Shanghai factory. Yet Elon Musk sounded optimistic when he said he expected to achieve \u201c50% average annual growth in vehicle deliveries over a multi-year horizon.","Jaccard Noise_60":0.0,"Cosine Noise_60":0.7877042294,"EM Noise_60":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_60":0,"Noise_80 Predicted Answer":"936,222","Noise_80 Document Index":"7","Noise_80 Document":"Jan 27, 2022 ...

The operator turned the parking lots of their family entertainment centers into popular drive-in movie theatres and concert venues. The exhibitor even offered up its San Antonio, Texas locations to high schools for drive-in graduation ceremonies in May of 2020. We even covered their phased approach to reopening in April of that year, back when we all naive enough to think the pandemic would be over by August. Who knew we had to clarify August of which year. Well, since then EVO has continued to grow, adding more screens, bowling lanes and video games. At the end of last year EVO was operating 71 screens across nine locations as well as 38 bowling lanes and full service restaurants in three of its sites. In the first week of this year, EVO acquired 100% of ShowBiz Cinemas, a Texas-based chain with 89 screens and 79 bowling lanes across nine locations in Texas, Oklahoma, Florida, and Wyoming. The founders of both circuits are related to Lee Roy Mitchell, founder and Executive Chairman of Cinemark; Kevin Mitchell of ShowBiz Cinemas is his son and Mitch Roberts of EVO is his grandson. This has led to some speculation that the all-cash deal was a way for Mr. Mitchell to shift money around or pay himself.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.3333333333,"Cosine Noise_0":0.6563841105,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":0,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Evo","Noise_20 Document Index":"10","Noise_20 Document":"Jan 5, 2022 ... 3, they have closed a transaction under which Evo has acquired 100% of the stock of Showbiz Cinemas in an all-cash deal.","Jaccard Noise_20":0.3333333333,"Cosine Noise_20":0.3071293235,"EM Noise_20":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":0,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"EVO Entertainment Group","Noise_40 Document Index":"4","Noise_40 Document":"Showbiz Cinemas was acquired by EVO Entertainment Group on Jan 3, 2022 .

In short: It's going to be a lot easier for Trump's fanbase to share his content on other platforms. Launched in February, Truth Social struggled during the first few months. Downloads plummeted after the initial rush to download due to a long waitlist of users wanting to sign up. However, in recent weeks, Trump finally started posting on his own platform, which has helped give the conservative social network another bounce.\u00a0 Truth Social announced a public beta of the web app just last week.

The Verge reported on Thursday that Google is in the early stages of development on Project Iris, the codename for an upcoming augmented reality headset with a planned 2024 launch window. The report noted that the 2024 window isn\u2019t set in stone and the device could launch later. As for what Project Iris can actually do, details are scarce for the moment. Google is apparently developing Iris in a building that requires special access privileges just to get inside. However, here are a few key points we know about Iris right now based on The Verge\u2019s reporting: They look like ski goggles There isn\u2019t an external power source Exterior cameras place virtual objects in the user\u2019s real-life field of view It runs on Android It uses a custom processor like the Tensor chip in Pixel smartphones An internet connection may be required for some graphical elements Other details, such as whether it\u2019ll use Google\u2019s existing hardware brand names (i.e., Pixel or Nest) or a new name entirely, are still up in the air. It probably won\u2019t share a name with Google Glass, which still exists but is a purely enterprise product now.

Common configurations include both central processing units (CPUs) and GPUs, but the makers of the chips differ, as does the infrastructure wiring them all together. To compare supercomputers, the industry uses a benchmark called floating-point operations per second\u2014or more colloquially, flops\u2014which measures the number of simple equations a supercomputer solves each second. According to the most recent Top500 list, the world\u2019s fastest all-around supercomputer, Fugaku, hails from Japan. Fugaku, which doesn\u2019t actually use any GPUs, recorded a blistering top speed of 442 petaflops (or 442 thousand trillion operations per second). That\u2019s fast. But systems like Fugaku are increasingly built to train AI too. So, Top500 began reporting a new benchmark for AI applications specifically. Since machine learning algorithms don\u2019t require the same precision as scientific applications, the new AI benchmark uses a less precise measure. By that measure, Fugaku hits peak speeds above an exaflop\u2014or a million trillion operations per second. This is what\u2019s meant by an AI supercomputer. Now, back to Meta. Most machines on the Top500 list are operated by governments and universities. Private supercomputers, like RSC and the machine built by OpenAI and Microsoft, don\u2019t appear on the list.

Our researchers will be able to train the largest models needed to develop advanced AI for computer vision, NLP, speech recognition, and more. We hope RSC will help us build entirely new AI systems that can, for example, power real-time voice translations to large groups of people, each speaking a different language, so they can seamlessly collaborate on a research project or play an AR game together.

To fully realize the benefits of self-supervised learning and transformer-based models, various domains, whether vision, speech, language, or for critical use cases like identifying harmful content, will require training increasingly large, complex, and adaptable models. Computer vision, for example, needs to process larger, longer videos with higher data sampling rates. Speech recognition needs to work well even in challenging scenarios with lots of background noise, such as parties or concerts. NLP needs to understand more languages, dialects, and accents. And advances in other areas, including robotics, embodied AI, and multimodal AI will help people accomplish useful tasks in the real world. High-performance computing infrastructure is a critical component in training such large models, and Meta\u2019s AI research team has been building these high-powered systems for many years.

The Super Bowl is an annual American football games which determines the champion of the NFL. The game involves the winning team from the American Football Conference championship game facing the winning team from the National Football Conference championship game. Since 1967 when the merger agreement took place between the NFC and AFC, teams have been competing to receive the Vince Lombardi Trophy, named after the great coach of the Green Bay Packers. It was this team that won the first two Super Bowls, raising questions over whether the AFC was good enough to compete in the event. Originally the NFL and AFL, the two leagues combined into one league in 1970 and instead split into two conferences, with 3 NFL teams converting over to the AFC to equal 13 teams on each side. The term Super Bowl was created by Kansas City Chief Owner Lamar Hunt after seeing his daughter play with a toy called the Super Ball. Only supposed to be a nickname until an official name was released, the term Super Bowl has stuck with the game ever since. Since the first game in 1967, the AFC has managed to win 11 Super Bowls with the NFC blitzing in with 23 Super Bowl championships. New Orleans and Miami seem to be the favourite places to host the Super Bowl as they have both hosted the game 9 times.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.1994463801,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

What\u2019s more, it also features a powerful cast, led by Gillian Anderson in one of her best roles. As compelling as Anderson is, she is matched by Jamie Dornan as the serial killer, who\u00a0exudes his familiar charm and charisma. While there are moments when the series can lose its momentum, there\u2019s no question that it is a provocative exploration of the criminal psyche. It\u2019s hard to think of a more famous fictional serial killer than Hannibal Lecter, who has appeared in multiple forms, including books, movies, and, of course, the TV series that bears his name. There are many things that set Hannibal apart from almost every other series on network TV, but most notable are its stylized violence and the undeniable chemistry between Hannibal and Will Graham. Though supposedly enemies, the two have a bond that forms the emotional core of the series.

Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo and written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, the film features an ensemble cast including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Don Cheadle, Paul Rudd, Brie Larson, Karen Gillan, Danai Gurira, Benedict Wong, Jon Favreau, Bradley Cooper, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Josh Brolin.

The Russo brothers joined as directors in April 2015, with Markus and McFeely signing on to write the script a month later.

Check out some fun facts about the cast. The 2022 film The Lost City is the perfect combination of comedy, adventure, romance, and an incredibly talented cast capable of pulling off any role. This film directed by Adam and Aaron Nee, from a story by Seth Gordon, features Loretta Sage, a brilliant author who writes romance novels set in exotic locations featuring Dr. Angela Lovemore and her romantic interest, Dash McMahon. But Loretta's real life bears no resemblance to the things she writes: after her husband's death, she became a reclusive, grumpy woman who is not even eager to write anymore. Halfway through a promotional tour for her latest novel, Loretta is kidnapped by a lunatic billionaire who wants her to lead him to a lost city treasure she depicted in her book. Fortunately, Loretta won't be alone: Alan, the cover model of her books, sets out on a journey to rescue her and demonstrate that he can also be a hero. Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum headline this blockbuster alongside Daniel Radcliffe, Da'Vine Joy Randolph, Brad Pitt, and Oscar Nunez, among other actors.

The slap was in response to Rock's joke about Smith's wife Jada Pinkett Smith's shaved head, which she had been shaving since 2021 due to alopecia areata. Smith returned to his seat and shouted profanity at Rock, who briefly responded, but completed his presentation without further interruption.  Later that evening, Smith won Best Actor and apologized to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and other nominees, but not to Rock, in his acceptance speech. The next day, he issued an apology to Rock and the Academy through social media. Smith resigned his Academy membership on April 1, facing a potential suspension or expulsion, and was banned from attending Academy events for 10 years, effective April 8.  Live television broadcasts in the United States mostly muted the incident due to federal censorship laws. However, uncensored international footage went viral on social media; an excerpt from the Australian broadcast became one of the most-viewed online videos in the first 24 hours. The incident received worldwide attention and largely overshadowed the rest of the ceremony.  After the ceremony, some publications recalled Rock's past remarks about Jada Pinkett Smith. In 1997, he had commented on her participation in the Million Woman March in an interview on his late night-talk show, The Chris Rock Show.","Jaccard Noise_20":0.1666666667,"Cosine Noise_20":0.4331899583,"EM Noise_20":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":1,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"Will Smith, right, hits presenter Chris Rock on stage","Noise_40 Document Index":"6","Noise_40 Document":"Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

The episode upstaged the rest of the 3-1\/2 hour show, and was sure to become one of the most memorable moments in 94 years of Academy Awards. It may cost Smith his sterling reputation in Hollywood, but not a criminal charge, at least for now, as Los Angeles police said Rock declined to file a police report.

Kotsur also won best supporting actor to become the first male deaf actor to win an Oscar, and only the second deaf actor to do so, joining his castmate and \"CODA\" co-star Matlin.

Scottie Scheffler is the 2022 Masters champion after shooting a final day 71 to finish ten under and crown four days of outrageously good golf. The World No.1 finished three shots clear of Rory McIlroy to claim his first Masters victory, his first green jacket, and it may be the first of many if he continues to play with the kind of focus and intensity he did here in Augusta. Showing a maturity way beyond his 25 years, Scheffler has now won four of the eight events he's played in 2022, four of his last six starts. Not even McIlroy, who shot a 64 on Sunday could catch the relentless Scheffler. A birdie on the 14th took the American back to -11 and gave him a four-shot cushion with four holes to play. \"Mr. Calm\" was never going to give that up and the patrons had plenty to cheer as Scheffler brought it home with two more birdies for a 10-under masterpiece. Practically his first mistake of the entire weekend came on the 18th green when he dropped a couple of shots on an easy putt slipping from 12 under to -10, but it hardly mattered as the hard work was already done.","Jaccard Noise_60":1.0,"Cosine Noise_60":1.0,"EM Noise_60":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_60":1,"Noise_80 Predicted Answer":"Scheffler","Noise_80 Document Index":"0","Noise_80 Document":"Over the next several hours, Scheffler, 25, rebuffed every challenge with the same aplomb to claim his first major championship, running away to win the 2022 Masters by three strokes.

Scheffler finished 10 under par for the tournament, in just his third Masters appearance. Rory McIlroy, who trailed Scheffler by 10 strokes heading into the final round, finished second after an eight-under-par 64. Smith and Shane Lowry tied for third, five strokes off the lead.

It is the third game in the Splatoon series following Splatoon 2. Like its predecessors in the Splatoon series, the game consists of online multiplayer (player versus player and player versus environment) alongside a single-player campaign, all featuring combat based around ink.  The game was first revealed in a teaser trailer on 17 February 2021 and was subsequently released on 9 September 2022.  The game received generally favorable reviews, with praise for its additional maps, single player campaign, customization options, and gameplay mechanics, but criticism for its matchmaking and disconnection issues and lack of new content. As of 31 March 2023 Splatoon 3 has now sold 10.67 million copies worldwide, making it the fastest-selling game in the franchise and one of the best-selling Switch games.[5]  Like its predecessors in the Splatoon series, Splatoon 3 is a third-person shooter. Players choose to be either an Inkling or Octoling as their player character. Both wield weaponry that uses colored ink as ammunition. Weapons are diverse in ability and imagery, with most resembling household objects. For example, Rollers are large paint rollers that can cover large amounts of area in ink but are generally limited to close-range combat.","Jaccard Noise_40":0.6666666667,"Cosine Noise_40":0.7830402851,"EM Noise_40":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":1,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"August","Noise_60 Document Index":"8","Noise_60 Document":"Splatoon 3 will launch at midnight local time everywhere in the world, Nintendo has confirmed.

Both the Republicans and Socialist parties, considered to be the dominant parties until 2017,[3] received their worst results in a presidential election.[4]  In the second round, Macron beat Le Pen with 58.5% of the vote to her 41.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":1.0000001192,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Emmanuel Macron","Noise_20 Document Index":"7","Noise_20 Document":"\u00a9 2023 Copyright France 24 - All rights reserved.

There\u2019s not nearly the same level of enthusiasm for him as when he first ran in 2017, launching his own centrist political movement and becoming France\u2019s youngest president. The turnout rate on Sunday was projected to be 72 percent, according to France\u2019s public broadcaster, which would make it the lowest in the second round of a presidential election in half a century. He has disappointed some of his supporters by pushing through tax cuts for the wealthy, being less ambitious than some hoped on climate change, and tacking right on immigration in ways that were calculated to appeal to Le Pen voters but that also echoed the messages from migration-skeptic leaders in Hungary and elsewhere.

{"Query":"What is the megapixel in main camera on the iPhone 14 Pro?","Correct Answer":["48"],"Noise_0 Predicted Answer":"48","Noise_0 Document Index":"0","Noise_0 Document":"On the hardware front, the biggest change between the two phones is the 14 Pro's new 48-megapixel sensor on the main wide camera that's also physically larger than the older iPhone, which makes just as much of a difference to photo quality as the increase in megapixels. The 13 Pro uses a 12-megapixel sensor. Using a technique called pixel binning, the iPhone 14 Pro joins four pixels together into groups to capture 12-megapixel photos with more detail. You can also take a full 48-megapixel image if you shoot in Apple's ProRaw format, and that gives photographers more flexibility when it comes to editing and recovering shadow and highlight detail among many other advantages. In good lighting, the 12-megapixel shots from both the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro look similar at reduced magnification, and it might not be that easy to spot the difference. It's when you push in a bit that the advantages of the 14 Pro's new sensor and image processing become clear. In the images below that I captured in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park, the tree trunks are more defined and sharper on the iPhone 14 Pro's photo than those on the 13 Pro. Areas of fine detail, like grass, also retain much more resolution. You can click through to the full resolution image from the iPhone 14 Pro and the iPhone 13 Pro to compare more easily.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":1.0,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"48","Noise_20 Document Index":"9","Noise_20 Document":"Our expert, award-winning staff selects the products we cover and rigorously researches and tests our top picks.

The iPhone 14 Pro has three rear cameras: a main wide-angle camera, an ultrawide and a telephoto camera with 3x optical zoom. The lens on the main camera has a wider focal length, going from a 26mm equivalent on previous iPhone models to a 24mm one. It isn't drastically different, but it helps get more of the scene into the frame.   Just a cat under mixed lighting, as captured by the iPhone 14 Pro. The main camera also gets a new,\u00a0larger, 48-megapixel sensor. Though more megapixels doesn't necessarily mean better photos, Apple divides the pixels into groups of four and combines the four in each group into one larger pixel. This technique is called pixel binning, and it's been used on Android phones for years. The results are brighter photos that have less image noise (and as a bonus, less noise-reduction blur).\u00a0Apple's new imagining pipeline, called the Photonic Engine, takes things further and helps improve color accuracy and protect details.

To do so, however, you need tools\u2014some of which are proprietary. With the \u201cSelf Service Repair Store\u201d opening today, you can now purchase those parts individually. However, doing so might not be the most cost-effective method. Spending $85 on a Torque Driver or $13 on a single Torx Security Bit adds significant cost to your repair, and you might only need these tools once or twice. Fortunately, Apple offers a $49 (including shipping) rental kit that contains all the tools and parts needed to make repairs on specific devices. Maybe too many parts, depending on which repair you\u2019re making, but there\u2019s no way to rent individual tools a la carte. The rental lasts for 7 days once you\u2019ve received the tool kit, after which you are charged \u201ca fee and a tax\u201d via a hold on your credit card.  Just be sure to stretch before you try hauling these kits to your workbench, because they are hefty. As MacRumors notes, the two cases you receive with the rental kits weigh 43 pounds and 36 pounds, individually. When stacked, the cases measure 20 inches wide and 47 inches tall.

Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories. While many big games have been delayed recently, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is moving in the opposite direction: Nintendo announced that the sci-fi RPG will now launch on July 29th instead of the previously planned September release. No specific reason was given for the change. The game will be a Nintendo Switch exclusive. Xenoblade Chronicles 3 will be the first main game in the series since its predecessor debuted on the Switch in 2017 and Nintendo first announced it earlier this year as part of the February 2022 Nintendo Direct. Like the rest of the series, the new game takes place in an expansive sci-fi universe; in addition to the release date, Nintendo also revealed a new trailer (embedded above) to further tease the story and world. The change in release date comes at a time when plenty of major releases have been delayed for various reasons, including the challenge of developing games remotely during the pandemic. Most recently, this has affected games like Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League and Nintendo\u2019s own sequel to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, both of which have been delayed until 2023.  \/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.3333333333,"Cosine Noise_0":0.9852647781,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":0,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"April 26, 2023","Noise_20 Document Index":"1","Noise_20 Document":"In the aftermath, Matthew, Na'el, Nikol, Glimmer, Panacea, Linka and Riku become the future Founders of the new City, leading the City survivors and Liberators in rebuilding it and upgrading the Ouroboros Stone.

Jackson's decision may have more to do with the underlying values of the rapper's life; he may not consider 50 Cent's career, so often involving violent episodes, to be much of a role model. Role models are what \"Coach Carter,\" Jackson's new film, is all about. He plays Ken Carter, who began as a sports star at Richmond (California) High School, setting records that still stand, and then had success in the military and as a small businessman. He's asked to take over as basketball coach, an unpaid volunteer position; the former coach tells him, \"I can't get them to show up for school.\" Ken Carter thinks he can fix that. The movie was directed by Thomas Carter (\"Save the Last Dance\"), no relation to the coach. It follows long-established genre patterns; it's not only a sports movie with the usual big games and important shots, but also a coach movie, with inspiring locker room speeches and difficult moral decisions. There are certain parallels with \"Friday Night Lights,\" although there it's the movie itself, and not the coach, that underlines the futility of high school stars planning on pro sports as a career. Certainly both movies give full weight to public opinion in the communities where they're set -- places where the public's interest in secondary education seems entirely focused on sports, where coaches are more important than teachers, where scores are more important than grades.","Jaccard Noise_40":0.0,"Cosine Noise_40":0.1989181638,"EM Noise_40":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":0,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"Robert Ri'chard","Noise_60 Document Index":"1","Noise_60 Document":"\"I see a system that's designed for you to fail,\" he tells his players, pointing out that young black men are 80 percent more likely to go to prison than to go to college.

The third iteration of Meta\u2019s AI chatbot Blender Bot and the company\u2019s answer to Google\u2019s LaMDA has taken a rather unpleasant but not unexpected turn. Just a week after its launch, Meta\u2019s Blender Bot 3 has turned on its creator and is already spewing marginally racist comments. Blender Bot 3 was released by the social networking giant on Friday, August 5. The conversational AI is designed to converse with humans about \u201cnearly any topic.\u201d Like Blender Bot 2, the latest upgrade also features the ability to browse the internet, is trained on the OPT-175B language model (which is 58x the size of Blender Bot 2), and has long-term memory.\u00a0 It also eliminates the limitations such as forgetfulness (which surprisingly makes machine learning models efficient when not used in chatbots). It has self-learning capabilities that allow it \u201cto improve its conversational skills and safety through feedback from people who chat with it, focusing on helpful feedback while avoiding learning from unhelpful or dangerous responses.\u201d Well, yes and no. While it is entirely plausible that the underlying AI tech helps it to \u2018learn,\u2019 it seems like Blender Bot 3 cannot differentiate between what is acceptable and what is not.

Meta says the chatbot uses artificial intelligence and can chat on \"nearly any topic\".

Meta said the chatbot was a prototype and might produce rude or offensive answers.  \"Everyone who uses Blender Bot is required to acknowledge they understand it's for research and entertainment purposes only, that it can make untrue or offensive statements, and that they agree to not intentionally trigger the bot to make offensive statements,\" said a Meta spokesperson. The chatbot, called BlenderBot 3, was released to the public on Friday. The programme \"learns\" from large amounts of publicly available language data.  When asked about Mark Zuckerberg, the chatbot told the BBC: \"He did a terrible job at testifying before congress. It makes me concerned about our country.\"  Mr Zuckerberg has been questioned several times by US politicians, most notably in 2018.  \"Our country is divided, and he didn't help with that at all,\" the chatbot continued. \"His company exploits people for money and he doesn't care.

However, they stressed that \"in development\" does not mean that a film is in current production or will ever go into production.[10]  In 2021, it was revealed that actors Eddie Redmayne (\"The Danish Girl\", \"The Theory of Everything\", \"Fantastic Beasts-series\") and Jamie Dornan (\"Fifty Shades of Grey\", \"Once Upon a Time\", \"Marie Antoinette\") auditioned for the film.[11]  In February of 2022, Take Two and 2K announced that the film was back in development and would be a Netflix exclusive film.[12]  In August of 2022, it was announced that Francis Lawrence would be helming the film as director, and Michael Green would be writing the script.","Jaccard Noise_40":1.0,"Cosine Noise_40":0.9999999404,"EM Noise_40":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":1,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"Juan Carlos Fresnadillo","Noise_60 Document Index":"5","Noise_60 Document":"READ MORE A BioShock film had been confirmed, and was originally planned to be released in 2011, coinciding with the release of a third BioShock game.

I don't want to get into it too much now because it's pretty early on in the process, but I certainly have not felt stifled in any way, or sent in any directions with Netflix. I mean, basically me and Cameron [MacConomy] who works with me, and Michael are getting to do what we want to do, which is great. A lot of it is staying really true to the game itself, and we're talking to Take-Two [Interactive] and Ken Levine. Despite the confidence, Lawrence is fully aware of how video game movies have failed in the past. Still, he's convinced that BioShock offers something meatier to the table that can survive the jump to the big screen. When asked if he knew about the disconnect in adaptations, he added: No, I do know what you mean.

Kadokawa Corporation, the current owner of FromSoft, will retain the majority of shares, owning 69.66 per cent of the studio. Sony will purchase a 14.09 per cent stake, and Tencent subsidiary Sixjoy Hong Kong will acquire 16.25 per cent. As reported by VGC, Kadokawa states it \"recognises the enhancement of capabilities for the creation, development and deployment of game IP as one of the Group\u2019s highest priorities\". To that end, FromSoftware will establish a \"third-party allotment\", essentially allowing for further funding from Sony and Sixjoy. This funding will primarily be leveraged to allow FromSoft to publish its own games globally. It already self-publishes in Japan, but has relied on larger publishers for other regions, such as Bandai Namco and Activision. Additionally, the studio will \"aim to proactively invest in development of more powerful game IP for itself to strengthen FromSoftware\u2019s development capabilities\". Sony has also acquired a minority of shares in other companies lately, such as Epic Games and Devolver Digital. Most recently, the platform holder has added Savage Game Studios to its first-party group. The company's really been splashing the cash this year.

In rather tedious news, Tencent and Sony Interactive Entertainment have acquired partial stakes in FromSoftware. More specifically, Tencent has 16.25% of shares and Sony Interactive Entertainment has 14.09% of shares in FromSoftware. The reason why this is boring is that Kadokawa is still the main owner (with 69.66% of the shares) and these new share acquisitions are both non-controlling stakes. In short, nothing has changed and neither Tencent nor Sony have any real decision-making power here. So if you were thinking that Sony would be able to force platform exclusivity for all future FromSoftware titles, then you would be wrong. This will just be business as usual, except that FromSoftware may have some more capital to play around with. One potentially interesting point here is that the money accrued from this will help FromSoftware bolster its publishing plans for the future. This is noteworthy because FromSoftware actually publishes its own games in Japan, so moving that to be more of a global endeavor would be better for all concerned. In that, in the past many of FromSoftware\u2019s games were released internationally by publishers that neither cared nor understood their games. The results were that FromSoftware\u2019s games were given no real international PR or marketing, and the localizations of these games were often thoroughly terrible as well.","Jaccard Noise_40":0.25,"Cosine Noise_40":0.5630176067,"EM Noise_40":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":1,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"Sony And Tencent","Noise_60 Document Index":"2","Noise_60 Document":"Aug 31, 2022 ...

He had abandoned a teenage ambition to become a painter, and had not yet thought of writing for a living, but Lee found a little work for him, ghost-writing a musical column printed under Lee's name in a satirical weekly, The Hornet.[2] Lee's relations with Bessie deteriorated after their move to London.[n 6] Shaw maintained contact with Lee, who found him work as a rehearsal pianist and occasional singer.[21][n 7]  Eventually Shaw was driven to applying for office jobs. In the interim he secured a reader's pass for the British Museum Reading Room (the forerunner of the British Library) and spent most weekdays there, reading and writing.[25] His first attempt at drama, begun in 1878, was a blank-verse satirical piece on a religious theme.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.6598016024,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

One of the most recognizable genres of music, country music has seen its fair share of stars and dynasties throughout its years.

The synopsis that Fox provides is tantalizing: Reigning King of Country Music Albie Roman, along with his insanely talented -- and tough as nails -- wife, Queen of Country Music Dottie Cantrell Roman, have created a country music dynasty, but even though the Roman name is synonymous with authenticity, the very foundation of their success is a lie. When their reign as country royalty is put in jeopardy, heir to the crown Nicolette \u201cNicky\u201d Roman will stop at nothing to protect her family\u2019s legacy, while ensuring her own quest for stardom, alongside her brother Luke and sister Gigi.

However, in re-imaging the conceit for a feature-length film, she and William Day Frank have smartly pivoted to build a string of reveals that keeps the macabre thrills coming. Admittedly, these jolts can make the movie feel episodic, leading me to wonder if they'd initially conceived of this as a web series or TV show. In the right headspace, this uneven ride can feel like binge-watching an addictive limited series. And, frankly, I value the rough edges when they come with such unexpected fun.\u00a0 For the first act, Susie Searches runs the risk of feeling dated, presenting an amateur detective in the guileless light of literal kids stuff, like Harriet the Spy or Scooby Doo. At this point, we've been so glutted with crime shows that this tact feels tired. However, as Susie solves her mystery, the movie moves into motivations, urging the audience to reconsider their heroine, to re-examine the clues, and to question whether what we want is justice or just a good story.  Kargman and Day weave together a deceptively chipper tone with a cynical thread and an appetite for tension for a finale that is outrageous and rewarding.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.3027313054,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

{"Query":"Which team will Kyle Busch join in 2023?","Correct Answer":["Richard Childress Racing"],"Noise_0 Predicted Answer":"Richard Childress Racing","Noise_0 Document Index":"0","Noise_0 Document":"By Alex Zietlow  Kyle Busch is moving from one storied racing team to another. The multi-time NASCAR Cup Series champion will join Richard Childress Racing in 2023, according to a report from Jordan Bianchi of The Athletic. The move ends a successful 15-year tenure with Joe Gibbs Racing. An official announcement is expected Tuesday, per the report. The news punctuates an eventful and \u201cstressful\u201d regular season for Busch, whose free agency dominated headlines and clouded a playoff-caliber season in 2022. It did so because his looming free agency revealed a strange reality in NASCAR economics \u2014 that one of the sport\u2019s biggest stars would have to struggle to find a home (even with taking a pay cut) because of something outside of his control. That \u201csomething\u201d outside of his control, in this case, was the result of the Mars Inc. decision to exit NASCAR at the end of the year, leaving Joe Gibbs Racing (Busch\u2019s current team) without a primary sponsor for Busch\u2019s No. 18 team. Busch confirmed to reporters earlier this month that he had \u201cmore than one\u201d team extend official contract offers to him. RCR was among those companies, per reports at the time. He also said that his uncertain future had been weighing on him. \u201cIt weighs on you every time, every day of the week,\u201d Busch said at NASCAR\u2019s playoff media day before the race at Darlington.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":1.0000001192,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Richard Childress Racing","Noise_20 Document Index":"4","Noise_20 Document":"Kyle Busch, driver of the No. 18 M&M's Thank You Fans!

The two-time Nascar Cup Series champion is officially a driver for Richard Childress Racing, as he will take over the No. 8 Chevrolet in 2023.

The 37-year-old Busch is in the final season of a multiyear contract with JGR and the two sides had been negotiating a contract extension for some time.

{"Query":"How much did Google acquire Mandiant for?","Correct Answer":["5.4 billion"],"Noise_0 Predicted Answer":"$5.4 billion","Noise_0 Document Index":"9","Noise_0 Document":"|   Chances are that you\u2019ve moved all your important documents, photos and other digital files to the cloud. So we can\u2019t ignore the significance of cloud cybersecurity moving forward as we continue to go completely digital in so many aspects of our lives. Cybersecurity companies are fighting for market share as data breaches and ransomware attacks become more common, more damaging and more expensive. With many companies turning towards cloud technology, it\u2019s no secret that companies like Google, Amazon and Microsoft are going to increase focus on this business sector. That said, Google\u2019s recent acquisition of the cyber security company, Mandiant, has stirred up a lot of conversation about the future of cloud cybersecurity and the highly competitive landscape therein. We\u2019re going to look at this space to see how much money the big players are making. It was announced on September 12 that Google\u2019s $5.4 billion bid to acquire the cybersecurity firm Mandiant was completed. Mandiant will be joining Google\u2019s cloud computing division so Google can attempt to compete with Amazon\u2019s AWS and Microsoft\u2019s Azure. This is Google\u2019s second-largest acquisition as the company aims to focus on enhancing its security operations suite and advisory services. With companies worldwide facing cyberattacks, the cloud cybersecurity space is expanding, and fast. With over 17 years of experience, Mandiant is a publicly-traded cybersecurity company that rose to prominence by discovering the SolarWinds attack where 18,000 clients unknowingly downloaded malware.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.9275108576,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"$5.4 billion","Noise_20 Document Index":"5","Noise_20 Document":"Google (GOOG, GOOGL) is finally sounding off on its blockbuster $5.4 billion acquisition of cybersecurity firm Mandiant, expressing the extent of the company's ambitions in the sector.

Again, Google Cloud is already strong when we think about how we analyze data and put it in context, and that only gets stronger with Mandiant.\u201d Venables was very clear that Google Cloud's ambitions in cybersecurity are massive, but on some level, the size of the deal already said it all. The acquisition is Google's second-largest ever, surpassed only by the company's $12.5 billion buyout of Motorola ten years ago. The more than $5 billion the company spent on Mandiant overshadows even what Google shelled out for Fitbit, which it bought for $2.1 billion.

It was (rightfully) reasoned that this title sounded more like that of poor fan-fiction rather than that of a follow on to arguably the best Legend of Zelda game to date. Another 4chan leak that has since been removed, but not before it was screenshotted by Inverse.

The sequel to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (2017), Tears of the Kingdom retains aspects including the open world of Hyrule, which has been expanded to allow for more vertical exploration. The player controls Link as he searches for Princess Zelda and fights to prevent the Demon King from destroying the world.  Tears of the Kingdom was conceived after ideas for Breath of the Wild downloadable content (DLC) had exceeded its scope. Its development was led by Nintendo's Entertainment Planning & Development (EPD) division, specifically Production Group Number 3,[1] with Breath of the Wild director Hidemaro Fujibayashi and producer Eiji Aonuma reprising their roles. A teaser was shown at E3 2019 with a full reveal at E3 2021. Tears of the Kingdom was initially planned for release in 2022 before being delayed to May 2023. It received acclaim for its improvements, expanded open world, and features encouraging exploration and experimentation. It sold more than 10 million copies in its first three days of release, and had sold over 18.5 million copies by June 2023.[2]  Tears of the Kingdom retains the open-world action-adventure gameplay of the previous Zelda game, Breath of the Wild (2017).","Jaccard Noise_80":0.3333333333,"Cosine Noise_80":0.8052191734,"EM Noise_80":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":0,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"May 12th","Noise_100 Document Index":"3","Noise_100 Document":"By  Ash Parrish, a reporter who has covered the business, culture, and communities of video games for seven years. Previously, she worked at Kotaku.  Tears of the Kingdom is only a scant 44 days away. To celebrate the game\u2019s impending arrival, Nintendo dropped a 13-minute mini Direct featuring gameplay and a sneak peek at Link\u2019s new abilities. Tears of the Kingdom, formerly known as The Sequel to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, was originally slated for a 2022 release. (It\u2019s now coming out on May 12th.) Eiji Aonuma, the game\u2019s producer, released a video in March 2022 stating that Nintendo decided to work on the development a little bit longer \u201cin order to make this game\u2019s experience something special.\u201d We can see some of that specialness in today\u2019s gameplay presentation. One of the biggest, most interesting features shown off today was Link\u2019s new Fuse ability, whereby he can take everyday objects like a log or a rock and mash them together to create weapons. It was fascinating watching Aonuma create useful weapons on the fly, and his demonstration of creating a homing arrow by fusing a monster eyeball with an arrow was seriously impressive. But be careful, weapon degradation, that mechanic from Breath of the Wild that players either wildly loved or viciously hated is back with Link\u2019s stick swords breaking after only a couple of swipes.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.25,"Cosine Noise_100":0.8414620161,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

The government is expected to face confidence votes in parliament next week. Forza Italia\u2019s Antonio Tajani is now the country\u2019s foreign minister. He has a long history with European institutions and was president of the European Parliament in 2017. The economy ministry will be in the hands of League\u2019s Giancarlo Giorgetti who is considered relatively pro-Europe, and one of the most moderate among party members.

By Radhika Seth On June 12, 2023, after enduring years of controversy, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the organization that founded the Golden Globes, announced that it would be closing. However, it seems this is not the end for the famously raucous ceremony, which has kicked off awards season for the past 80 years. Here\u2019s everything you need to know about the 2024 Golden Globe Awards, and how we ended up here. By all accounts, yes. Eldridge Industries, a holding company owned by the billionaire investor Todd Boehly, and Dick Clark Productions, which has produced the Golden Globes telecast for decades, have reportedly agreed to purchase the HFPA\u2019s Golden Globes assets, rights, and properties for an undisclosed price. They\u2019ll form a new non-profit, the Golden Globe Foundation, which will continue the philanthropic work of the HFPA. (The organization has given more than $50 million to entertainment-related charities over the last 30 years.) Meanwhile, a yet-to-be-named for-profit entity will also seek to expand the Golden Globes as a brand.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.5130382776,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

Tetsuya Yamagami was arrested immediately after allegedly shooting Abe with a homemade gun as the former leader was making a campaign speech on July 8 outside a train station in Nara in western Japan. Yamagami then underwent a nearly six-month mental evaluation prosecutors said showed he's fit to stand trial.   Yamagami was also charged with violating a gun control law, according to the Nara District Court. Police have said Yamagami told them he killed Abe, one of Japan's most influential and divisive politicians, because of Abe's apparent links to a religious group that he hated. In his statements and in social media postings attributed to him, Yamagami said he developed a grudge because his mother had made massive donations to the Unification Church that bankrupted his family and ruined his life.  One of his lawyers, Masaaki Furukawa, told The Associated Press on Thursday that Yamagami will have to take responsibility for the serious consequences of his alleged actions and that his defense lawyers will do their best to reduce his sentence.","Jaccard Noise_80":1.0,"Cosine Noise_80":1.0000001192,"EM Noise_80":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":1,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"Yamagami","Noise_100 Document Index":"5","Noise_100 Document":"Jan 13, 2023 ...

Jace is the oldest, and next in the line of succession for the Iron Throne after Rhaenyra (according to King Viserys' decision). Luke is her middle child, and is a few years younger than Jace. The newborn baby in this episode is named Joffrey after the man Laenor was in love with as a teenager. Joffrey was killed by Ser Criston in the middle of Laenor and Rhaenyra's wedding welcome feast last episode. This episode introduced us to three new dragons onscreen. Dreamfyre was the large dragon who spouted flames over Aemond's head in the caves. This dragon is different from Rhaenyra's own she-dragon, Syrax, who was mentioned in the episode by Rhaenyra at the Small Council meeting when she offered to give Aemond one of Dreamfyre's next dragon eggs. Vermax is still pretty small for a dragon, likely just a few years old judging by their size (if Dany's dragons in \"Game of Thrones\" are meant to be analogous to these ones).

The channel's most successful comedy since Father Ted, the series was inspired by McGee's own experiences growing up in Derry, Northern Ireland, in the 1990s, during the final years of the Troubles.[5] It stars Saoirse-Monica Jackson, Louisa Harland, Nicola Coughlan, Jamie-Lee O'Donnell, and Dylan Llewellyn as five teenagers living in mid-1990s Derry while attending Our Lady Immaculate College, a fictional girls' Catholic secondary school based on the real-life Thornhill College, where McGee herself studied.[6][7] Produced by British production company Hat Trick Productions, Derry Girls is filmed in Northern Ireland, with most scenes shot on location in Derry and some in Belfast.  Although the plot lines of Derry Girls are fictional, the series frequently references actual events of the Troubles and the Northern Ireland peace process, including the 1994 IRA ceasefire announcement, the 1995 visit to Northern Ireland of President Bill Clinton and First Lady Hillary Clinton, and the Good Friday referendum of 1998.","Jaccard Noise_40":0.0,"Cosine Noise_40":0.5728625059,"EM Noise_40":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":0,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"Tuesday 12 April 12","Noise_60 Document Index":"4","Noise_60 Document":"Most of her previous work was as a playwright, though she has also penned episodes of Being Human and The White Queen on the BBC and teamed up with her husband Tobias Beer to write\u00a0 psychological thriller The Deceived, which is currently on Netflix.

This means Derry Girls could land in June 2022 at the earliest or at some point this summer. Fingers crossed it will not be too long a wait.

Season 3 will see the gang waiting for their exam results but, as teased in the trailer, fans can expect to see a lot of the usual mess the Derry Girls find themselves in.

Max Verstappen secured his second World Championship title after finishing first, in front of Sergio P\u00e9rez and Charles Leclerc. Despite only 28 of the scheduled 53 laps being completed, full points were awarded due to a loophole in the regulations regarding how points should be allocated, with the rules stating that reduced points should only be awarded in shortened races that end under red flag conditions. As this race ended under green flag conditions, this system was not applied. The wording of the sporting regulations was subsequently amended for 2023, so races that do not reach the 75 percent distance are awarded shortened race points regardless of whether a race finishes under red or green flag conditions.  The event was held across the weekend of the 7\u20139 October.

But Verstappen's title celebrations were overshadowed by the chaos and confusion during and after the wet race last Sunday, which has led to even more questions being raised about the procedures and attitudes of motorsport's governing body. There was also plenty of intrigue further down the field and off the track too. Here are the headline takeaways from F1's first visit back to Suzuka in three years.

It was resumed two hours later with 28 of the 53 laps completed and Verstappen leading the whole way. He was followed by teammate Sergio Perez in second and Ferrari driver Charles Leclerc.

Plus, his defence\/attack against Lewis Hamilton in 2021 and Leclerc last weekend helped seal Verstappen's two titles. This is all to his credit. But the picture is only rosy if Red Bull keeps winning easily. If another team\/driver combo in the future produces a stiffer challenge than Ferrari\/Leclerc in 2022, then the unbalanced Red Bull line-up will be exposed.

It made an overpriced GPU suddenly appear much more desirable than it ever should have been. Now, the question is, was this Nvidia\u2019s plan all along, or did it simply overestimate the enthusiasm people would have for the 4080? Considering the fact that Nvidia is planning to strategically cut the MSRP of the RTX 4080 soon, it might be that it never intended for the 4080 to serve as a crutch for the sales of the 4090. Nvidia also has some serious competition on the horizon. AMD will soon be launching the next-gen Radeon RX 7900 XTX and 7900 XT, both of which are supposed to rival the RTX 4080, but at more reasonable prices \u2014 $999 and $899, respectively. With the upcoming price cut, the RTX 4080 might become a more worthwhile contender. For now, if you manage to spot the 4090 for $1,600, it is a better deal \u2014 but only if you can make use of it. If you\u2019re a casual gamer, save your money and get the 4080 without worrying about benchmarks and comparisons. Personally, I\u2019m still waiting for the 7900 XTX, and judging by the performance per dollar of the RTX 4080, I really have no regrets.","Jaccard Noise_40":0.0,"Cosine Noise_40":0.6546431184,"EM Noise_40":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":0,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"$1,599","Noise_60 Document Index":"3","Noise_60 Document":"Oct 13, 2022 ...

Since the launch of the RTX 4090 on October 12, a total of 3,050 units have been sold through the U.S. version of eBay, at an average price of $2,328. It\u2019s barely worth it to resell these cards right now. Around the time of the RTX 4080 launch (November 16), the sales of the 4090 started rising and have been on a steady, albeit slow, rise ever since. The prices are now close to what they were around the time of launch. The RTX 4080 is not doing so well. Only 281 units have been sold since November 16, at an average price of $1,496.

It is the ninth installment in the series, the ninth chronologically, and the sequel to 2018's God of War. Loosely based on Norse mythology, the game is set in ancient Scandinavia and features series protagonist, Kratos, and his now teenage son, Atreus. Concluding the Norse era of the series, the game covers Ragnar\u00f6k, the eschatological event which is central to Norse mythology and was foretold to happen in the previous game after Kratos killed the Aesir god Baldur.  The gameplay is similar to the previous 2018 installment. It features combo-based combat, as well as puzzle and role-playing elements. The gameplay has been revamped from the previous game: in addition to Kratos' main weapons, a magical battle axe and his double-chained blades, he also acquires a magical spear and his shield has become more versatile, with different types of shields that have differing offensive and defensive abilities. His son Atreus, as well as some other characters, provide assistance in combat and can be passively controlled.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.6666666667,"Cosine Noise_0":0.7897343636,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"November 9, 2022","Noise_20 Document Index":"2","Noise_20 Document":"\/VvHuaCKgGn \u2014 Santa Monica Studio \u2013 God of War Ragnar\u00f6k (@SonySantaMonica) September 16, 2020  God of War Ragnarok is set to launch on November 9, 2022.

Between assassination attempts, mafia, familial conflict, and beautiful Italian scenery, The White Lotus: Sicily had a lot in common with The Godfather. Similar to Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s 1972 crime classic, season 2 was filmed on location in Italy. The San Domenico Palace, Taormina stands in for the clifftop resort in the series. Additionally, White makes use of several local wonders, including the Ionian Sea, the Greek Theater of Teatro Antico di Taormina, and the active Mount Etna volcano, which erupts in the final episode, \u201cArrivederci.\u201d Considering that The White Lotus: Sicily focuses on the issues of colonialism, it makes sense that the series was filmed in a location with a complex history.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.7206804752,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":0,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Sicily, Italy","Noise_20 Document Index":"5","Noise_20 Document":"Keep reading to find out more, or click here to skip ahead.

Between Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery, White Noise, and Triangle of Sadness, we got a ton of great content that forced the upper class to have traumatic vacations. The pinnacle of this was the second season of The White Lotus, which moved the miniseries to a luxurious new location in Italy. Unfortunately for the characters, this had more in common with the Italian scenery of The Talented Mr. Ripley than it did with Under The Tuscan Sun. As with the first season, the end of this trip is teased at the very beginning, and it\u2019s a violent one. Both seasons of The White Lotus take place at individual locations in a luxury vacation resort chain. A multitude of guests (most of whom are incredibly wealthy) interact with the staff and local residents, only to begin squabbling and bringing up past issues. While the show\u2019s brilliance stems from the inventive storytelling of writer\/director Mike White, it doesn\u2019t hurt that the show has the budget and scale of an HBO production. In order to make the series as authentic as possible, White and his production team utilized several real locations in both seasons.

Control of the U.S. Congress remained hanging in the balance on Wednesday morning as Democrats have shown surprising strength, defying expectations and defeating Republicans in a series of competitive races. (Nov. 9) WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Republicans inched closer to a narrow House majority Wednesday, while control of the Senate hinged on a few tight races in a midterm election that defied expectations of sweeping conservative victories driven by frustration over inflation and President Joe Biden\u2019s leadership. Either party could secure a Senate majority with wins in both Nevada and Arizona \u2014 where the races were too early to call. But there was a strong possibility that, for the second time in two years, the Senate majority could come down to a runoff in Georgia next month, with Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock and Herschel Walker failing to earn enough votes to win outright. In the House, Republicans on Wednesday night were within a dozen seats of the 218 needed to take control, while Democrats kept seats in districts from Virginia to Pennsylvania to Kansas and many West Coast contests were still too early to call. In a particularly symbolic victory for the GOP, Sean Patrick Maloney of New York, the House Democratic campaign chief, lost his bid for a sixth term. Control of Congress will decide how the next two years of Biden\u2019s term play out, and whether he is able to achieve more of his agenda or will see it blocked by a new GOP majority.","Jaccard Noise_40":0.0,"Cosine Noise_40":0.9768142104,"EM Noise_40":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":0,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"The GOP","Noise_60 Document Index":"1","Noise_60 Document":"Connecting decision makers to a dynamic network of information, people and ideas, Bloomberg quickly and accurately delivers business and financial information, news and insight around the world Americas+1 212 318 2000 EMEA+44 20 7330 7500 Asia Pacific+65 6212 1000 Connecting decision makers to a dynamic network of information, people and ideas, Bloomberg quickly and accurately delivers business and financial information, news and insight around the world Americas+1 212 318 2000 EMEA+44 20 7330 7500 Asia Pacific+65 6212 1000 ARTICLE Last Updated Dec. 7, 2022  IN THIS ARTICLE  What is the balance of power in the House?

In the 22 midterm elections from 1934 -2018, the President's party has averaged a loss of 28 House seats and four Senate seats. The president\u2019s party gained seats in the House only three times, but gained seats in the Senate on six occasions. The president\u2019s party has gained seats in both houses only twice. The incumbent president\u2019s ability to launch new major policy initiatives would be greatly weakened under divided government. If the Democrats lose control of either House, the Administration can expect to be the target of numerous disruptive congressional inquiries. Using the data we discuss below (and provide here) we would expect Democratic seat losses of around 30 in the House and 3 in the Senate. There are large error bounds around these estimates. The prediction range includes the possibility of a narrow Democratic gain in the Senate, but loss of the majority in the House seems likely. Graphs below show the two-variable relationships. Democrats have a 9 seat margin currently in the House (with four seats vacant) and the parties are tied in the Senate. A Democratic loss in the House of fewer than 12 seats would be very unexpected. Like many midterm projections, these estimates are based on aggregated data. There is no measure of current national controversies (for example, abortion or Trump-related litigation controversies). Both will affect turnout. Nor do we have any explicit measure of conditions and candidates in specific elections.","Jaccard Noise_80":0.0,"Cosine Noise_80":0.6566407681,"EM Noise_80":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":0,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"Democrats","Noise_100 Document Index":"0","Noise_100 Document":"Turnout is likely to be larger than normal, and usually that would be expected to favor the Democrats. Partisan seat swings in midterm elections are consistently correlated with two factors:\u00a0 Approval: President Biden\u2019s approval ratings have been in the low 40% range for most of 2022. The most recent data (as of this writing) show an approval rate of 44%. In our graphs, one can see the typical positive association between approval and seat loss\/gain in both the House and Senate. In both instances the correlation is moderately strong:\u00a0 r= 0.61 for the House, r = 0.45 for the Senate. From 1936-2018, near the midterms, six presidents have had approval ratings in the range of 40-45%--like Biden. Those cases involved wide variation in seat loss or gain. The range of outcomes in the Senate was between -9 and +2\u00a0 seats. The average was a loss of 4. In the House, presidents with approval between 40-45%, saw their party lose between 63 and 13 seats, with an average loss of 36 seats. There have been no instances of House seat gains for Presidents with approval as low as Biden\u2019s.

The bride kept it simple with her accessories, which included Tiffany & Co. diamond and pearl drop earrings and a wedding band by the same jewelry designer. A bouquet of white blooms and greenery gave her outfit the perfect classic touch.   Prior to the big day, there was a lot of speculation about which designer Biden would select for her wedding.

It has been a while since the profilers' last on-screen case, but the characters' stories continued during that period. Granted that revival retcons the Criminal Minds finale in several ways, it's essentially the same thing. That being said, Paramount+ just cannot simply use the title Criminal Minds season 16 because the project is different in a couple of significant ways from its original run. That includes veering away from its episodic storytelling format to a more serialized one, not to mention being darker and more disturbing than CBS' iteration. By giving the Criminal Minds revival a new title, Paramount+ allows it to be both a reboot and a continuation of the CBS series.

That being said, Paramount+ just cannot simply use the title Criminal Minds season 16 because the project is different in a couple of significant ways from its original run. That includes veering away from its episodic storytelling format to a more serialized one, not to mention being darker and more disturbing than CBS' iteration.

In the news release Saturday, Alberts made no mention of what would happen to Joseph. Frost was fired because of his 16-31 record as the coach, Alberts said at the announcement back in September.

The retail warehouse giant opted not to raise the cost of a membership even as rival Sam\u2019s Club did. Costco served up some of the cheapest gas prices in town when prices at the pump were sizzling in the summer months. The company was often the last grocer to raise prices on household essentials despite biting price hikes from vendors. To top it off, the Issaquah, Washington based retailer kept the price of its legendary $1.50 hot dog intact and continued to offer employees among the best compensation packages in all of retail. For its efforts, Costco was rewarded with impressive sales gains seemingly every month of the year, a stock price that relatively out-performed the S&P 500 and Yahoo Finance\u2019s coveted \u201cCompany of the Year\u201d award.

Charlie Baker","Noise_40 Document Index":"1","Noise_40 Document":"The NCAA had four major priorities in it search for a new president to look after college athletics. It wanted a former college athlete, an exec passionate about higher education, an established corporate leader and a savvy politician who knows how to get things done in government. The governing body found all of those traits and more in Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker, a former Harvard basketball athlete and avid sports fan. The NCAA announced today that it has selected the two-term governor to be its next president. Baker will replace outgoing NCAA President Mark Emmert starting March 1. His second term as governor is slated to conclude Jan. 5; he announced about a year ago that he wouldn\u2019t seek a third term. Emmert will stay on as an adviser through June. The NCAA\u2019s choice of Baker, 66, signifies the association\u2019s desire to have a leader who is well-versed in the ways that Washington, D.C., works. With the NCAA facing so many legal and legislative challenges, the board of governors, who made the hire, focused on someone from the political arena early in the process and Baker emerged as the candidate with the experience and expertise to navigate the governmental and athletic worlds that often collide in college sports. When asked why he wanted the job, Baker replied, \u201cBecause it\u2019s worth doing. Yeah, it\u2019s big and complicated, but so have been a lot of things in my life.\u201c Baker represents the first NCAA leader who doesn\u2019t have a background in college athletics or higher education.","Jaccard Noise_40":0.6666666667,"Cosine Noise_40":0.9529221058,"EM Noise_40":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":1,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"Daniel Murphy","Noise_60 Document Index":"7","Noise_60 Document":"They are asking for big favors at a time when the NCAA's credibility on Capitol Hill has been hurt by the embarrassing gender inequities in last year's March Madness tournaments, the skyrocketing salaries of football coaches, increasing concerns about athletes' well-being and myriad other issues that have made the leaders of college sports a largely unsympathetic bunch in the eyes of politicians and the general public. -- Daniel Murphy More threats to the NCAA's business model remain on the horizon. Along with additional antitrust lawsuits, the organization is also just starting to defend against multiple attempts to reclassify some college athletes as employees of their schools. That combination is likely to leave a new president unable to make rules that slow down the money that boosters and schools are steering into the pockets of athletes while also trying to convince the National Labor Relations Board that those same athletes are students rather than workers in a multibillion dollar industry. Managing the would-be employers in that equation won't be a simple task either. The richest and most powerful conferences in schools have already started to question if they still fit comfortably in the confines of the NCAA's current top division. Those entities will only become richer and powerful during a new president's tenure as they sign new media rights contracts and potentially revamp the College Football Playoff -- two decisions over which the NCAA president has no control.","Jaccard Noise_60":0.0,"Cosine Noise_60":0.4816972017,"EM Noise_60":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_60":0,"Noise_80 Predicted Answer":"Charlie Baker","Noise_80 Document Index":"1","Noise_80 Document":"\ud83c\udfc8 Ranking the top 25 college football teams \ud83c\udfc6 Preseason FCS bracket projections \ud83d\udcc8 HBCU football power rankings \ud83d\udcca Men's soccer preseason rankings  INDIANAPOLIS \u2014\u00a0The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) today announced that Charlie Baker, the Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, will serve as the next NCAA President, assuming the role effective March 2023.

In addition to his two terms as Governor, he brings decades of experience spearheading transformations at high profile institutions in the private and public sectors.

The inequities between the men and women were obvious and stark, which put the NCAA into damage-control mode. At that point, those in the women's basketball world had to question if Emmert was very sincere in his concern, but there was a \"better-late-than-never\" sentiment. And the NCAA's decision to commission the so-called Kaplan report, which did a deep dive into inequities in all men's and women's NCAA championships, was an important step because it didn't pull any punches about how significant those issues have been. The report also said the NCAA has been selling women's sports short regarding potential television revenue. When it's time to negotiate TV rights again, rather than selling multiple championships in a bargain bundle, the NCAA needs to think bigger about the worth of each championship and how best to maximize revenue from it. Also, the NCAA has to show more leadership regarding the inclusion of transgender athletes in competition. As with so many things, the NCAA has been behind on this. Dave Wilson: The next leader is going to have to get creative to figure out the mess of issues currently embroiling college sports, or finally just step out of the way and put on tournaments.

The company has also faced criticism for its handling of the situation and the toxic work environment that allegedly exists within the company. This has resulted in significant public backlash, with some fans and employees calling for boycotts and protests. Alegre\u2019s departure from Activision to Yuga Labs may be seen as a positive move for those who are critical of Activision\u2019s leadership and culture. It\u2019s worth noting that the gaming industry and the NFT space have both been the subject of intense scrutiny and controversy in recent years. The allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination at Activision Blizzard have been a particularly significant source of controversy in the gaming industry. Meanwhile, the NFT space has faced criticism for its environmental impact and the high levels of speculation and price volatility surrounding some NFTs. Furthermore, the recent fake news surrounding Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) highlights the need for responsible and informed reporting in the NFT space. Given these issues, the appointment of Alegre as Yuga Labs\u2019 CEO marks an interesting new phase for the company.

The Bulldogs didn't always look flashy, but they turned it on when needed. In the season-opener against Oregon, the Bulldogs won by 46 points. In back-to-back rivalry games against Tennessee and Florida, they won by a combined 36 points. In the SEC title game against LSU, they won by 20 points. If Georgia brings its best game to Mercedes-Benz Stadium on Saturday night, Ohio State will have very little margin for error. The regular-season finale against Michigan left a sour taste in Ohio State's mouth, but a national championship would fix that. There is no denying that the Buckeyes have the talent to win two more games and capture the national title.

In terms of underlying trends that contribute to growth of real potential GDP over the 2022\u20132031\u00a0period, revisions are very modest, and the average annual growth rate over the period, slightly greater than 1.8\u00a0percent, is practically unchanged. In nominal terms, however, the agency\u2019s projections of output and income are higher throughout the projection period because projected inflation over the next several years is above the rates anticipated in July. Nominal GDP is 4.9\u00a0percent higher, and national income is 3.9\u00a0percent higher, in 2031 than CBO projected last summer.

Fury of the Gods\u201d arrives with two strikes against it since it\u2019s not only a studio-produced sequel but also a superhero movie made in 2023. One should expect a certain level of creative committee-mandated, Mad Libs-y monotony, regardless of how one feels about the surprisingly decent \u201cShazam!\u201d. The makers of that fine-enough 2019 franchise-starter, including director David F.\u00a0Sandberg,\u00a0toned down both the Troma Lite cynicism and post-Spielberg sentimentality that\u2019s come to define the lighthearted James Gunn-style super-projects that dominate the\u00a0landscape. \u201cShazam! Fury of the Gods\u201d meanders further in that direction. The first \u201cShazam!\u201d works as well as it does because it\u2019s mostly focused on two adolescent pipsqueaks, Billy Batson (Asher Angel) and Freddy Freeman (Jack Dylan Grazer), who get sucked into a generic fantasy, with some assistance from their extended family of orphan buddies. \u201cShazam! Fury of the Gods\u201d mostly sticks to the comic book formula that the first movie poked fun at, despite another strong comedic performance from star Zachary Levi and some sporadic yuks throughout.

After\u00a0talking about that commercial goal for a while, however, he revealed his bigger ambition: \u201cHopefully, many years from now, at the end and looking back on my life, what I will be able to say we did, and what I will be most proud of, is to prove a different business model for social media. \u201cSocial media is the majority of media consumption.\u00a0And people have lost control. The algorithms are in control of everything you see.\u00a0And the algorithm has been told to maximize your view time.

Prior to joining Google, Ready was executive vice president and chief operating officer of PayPal. He'd been at Google fewer than three years. Pinterest has more than 400 million monthly active users and has long placed its focus on its advertising business. But in recent years, it has shifted to make e-commerce more of a priority.

Amazon's Astro robot, which helps with tasks like setting an alarm, was unveiled last year at an introductory price of $1,000. But its rollout has been limited and has received a lackluster response. The company hasn't had much success with household robots, but the iRobot acquisition and the company's strong market reputation provide a \"massive foothold in the consumer robot market\" that could help Amazon replicate the success of its Echo line of smart speakers, said Lian Jye Su, a robotics industry analyst for ABI Research. Su said it also illustrates the shortcomings of consumer robotics vendors like iRobot, which struggled to expand beyond a niche product and was in a \"race-to-the-bottom\" competition with Korean and Chinese manufacturers offering cheaper versions of a robotic vacuum. On Friday, iRobot reported its quarterly results. Revenue plunged 30% primarily on order reductions and delays, and the company announced it was laying off 10% of its workforce. Amazon said it will acquire iRobot for $61 per share in an all-cash transaction that will include iRobot's net debt. The company has total current debt of approximately $332.1 million as of July 2.

So it's been a long road, but I got to make the feature film of my dreams. I feel like I'm kind of the most ready I've ever been to make it.  Actor Priya Kansara and director Nida Manzoor on the set of Polite Society. I knew I wanted to make a film that was about two sisters, that really foregrounds this sisterly love story, because I don't think we get to see that a lot in films, especially not with action and dance numbers. It was drawn a lot from my own relationship with my sister, such a close, intimate, and loving relationship. But then, when you fight with your siblings, that kind of fighting can be the most brutal.  It's important to me to show a South Asian family [the way I did], because it's sort of been my experience.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.5,"Cosine Noise_0":0.7388312221,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":0,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Nida Manzoor","Noise_20 Document Index":"4","Noise_20 Document":"And, you know, I noticed all of the main characters - both the heroes and the villains - they are women.

MANZOOR: You know, it's been the women who've uplifted me the most in my life, but who've also cut me down the hardest. There's something about the pain of a woman critiquing another woman that hurts more when - than when a man does it. CHANG: Yeah. MANZOOR: Like, you're part of - you should be on my team. It just cuts deep on a whole other level. And so for me, I'm most interested of seeing women - you know, the matriarch who upholds the patriarchy. And, you know, it's so exciting as well to explore, like, as you say, a female villain. The dark feminine is so beautiful because it's something that we have had to quash. We've had to deny.

The film received favourable reviews from critics.  In London, British-Pakistani teenager Ria Khan aspires to become a movie stuntwoman like her idol, Eunice Huthart. Under an alter-ego, \"The Fury\", Ria creates films of martial arts training with the help of her older sister Lena, who has dropped out of art school and moved back in with their loving but traditional parents, Fatima and Rafe, both of them discouraging Ria's dreams.   At school, Ria is inseparable from her friends Clara and Alba, but their disapproving teacher urges her to pursue a more \"serious\" career. Ria's emails to Eunice about a potential mentorship go unanswered, and she is soundly defeated by the school bully Kovacs.","Jaccard Noise_40":1.0,"Cosine Noise_40":1.0,"EM Noise_40":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":1,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"Nida Manzoor","Noise_60 Document Index":"7","Noise_60 Document":"For more on Universal Pictures, Peacock, and Focus Features projects, check out these stories: Christopher Nolan Reveals Riveting \u201cOppenheimer\u201d Footage at Universal\u2019s CinemaCon Presentation New \u201cFast X\u201d Trailer Finds Jason Momoa\u2019s Dante Taking on the Family \u201cRenfield\u201d Stunt Coordinator Chris Brewster Sinks His Teeth Into Hyperkinetic Action-Comedy Featured image: Priya Kansara stars as Ria Khan in director Nida Manzoor\u2019s POLITE SOCIETY, a Focus Features release.

With the device unfolded, I ran two apps side by side, which was useful for reading a webpage while typing an email.

Holding the phone unfolded, you can speak English into the microphone and have the phone\u2019s outer screen show text translated into Chinese to the other person. When the Chinese speaker responds, you can read the translated text on the inner screen. This feature will not be released until the fall, so I didn\u2019t get to test it. But it\u2019s an intriguing use case. In the end, the device is expensive because it is packed with advanced technology with no major trade-offs. In my tests, its camera produced crisp and vibrant images on a par with photos taken with Apple\u2019s latest iPhone and the Pixel 7 Pro, Google\u2019s $900 smartphone, which has an excellent camera. Though the Pixel Fold\u2019s high price will make it inaccessible to most people, it was an exciting glimpse into the next step for smartphones.

The PHE has been in place since January 27, 2020, and renewed throughout the pandemic. The latest HHS extension for the PHE is effective through January 11, 2023. In a letter to the state Governors, the Administration has indicated they will give at least a 60-day notice before the PHE ends. In April, ASHA urged HHS to extend the PHE in a letter to Secretary Xavier Becerra [PDF]. In addition, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2022 (P.L. 117-103) provides a 151-day extension to some flexibilities, once the federal PHE ends. With this PHE renewal and the additional 151-day extension, ASHA expects certain flexibilities will continue at least into the second quarter of 2023, such as continued payment for audiology and speech-language pathology telehealth services provided to Medicare beneficiaries. With each PHE extension, numerous flexibilities and waivers remain in effect, including Medicare telehealth coverage of audiology and speech-language pathology services and relaxed Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requirements.

Call me some type of weird photo purist, but I\u2019m not a fan of editing a photo in a way that would alter my memory of an event.

Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.  One of the most impressive demos at Google I\/O started with a photo of a woman in front of a waterfall. A presenter onstage tapped on the woman, picked her up, and moved her to the other side of the image, with the app automatically filling in the space where she once stood. They then tapped on the overcast sky, and it instantly bloomed into a brighter cloudless blue. In just a matter of seconds, the image had been transformed. The AI-powered tool, dubbed the Magic Editor, certainly lived up to its name during the demo. It\u2019s the kind of tool that Google has been building toward for years. It already has a couple of AI-powered image editing features in its arsenal, including the Magic Eraser, which lets you quickly remove people or objects from the background of an image.

Under the CBA a player may withdraw his name from consideration from the draft at any time before the final declaration deadline, which usually falls 10 days before the draft at 5:00 pm EDT (2100 UTC). Under current NCAA rules, players usually have until 10 days after the draft combine to withdraw from the draft and retain college eligibility. They must have withdrawn on or before May 31, 22 days prior to this draft.[70]  A player who has hired an agent retains his remaining college eligibility regardless of whether he is drafted after an evaluation from the NBA Undergraduate Advisory Committee. Players who declare for the NBA draft and are not selected have the opportunity to return to their school for at least another year only after terminating all agreements with their agents, who must have been certified.[73]","Jaccard Noise_60":0.0,"Cosine Noise_60":0.8208633661,"EM Noise_60":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_60":0,"Noise_80 Predicted Answer":"Tuesday 16 May","Noise_80 Document Index":"3","Noise_80 Document":"The 2023 NBA Draft Lottery will take place on 16 May.

Apple plans to charge $3,499 for the Vision Pro when it launches in 2024, but the company wants to create a model that has a lower cost to broaden the appeal of the device. Apple engineers plan to use more affordable components to bring the price down, but the lower-priced headset will have the same general AR\/VR \"mixed reality\" functionality of the Vision Pro. The chips in the device will be on par with the iPhone rather than the Mac-level chips used in the first AR\/VR headset, and Apple may also use lower resolution internal displays and cheaper materials. As of right now, development on the more affordable headset is in the early stages and Apple has not created a working prototype. Foxconn is already working on a lower-cost headset, and rumors right now suggest it could come in late 2025 at the earliest.  According to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the second-generation Vision Pro will be available in both high-end and low-end models, similar to the iPhone.

He also birdied the par-4 sixth hole from the rough just short of the green, but at the eighth hole hit his second shot into the rough to the left of the green. He failed to advance the ball on his third shot and ended up with a bogey on the par-five.[24]  With a two-shot lead playing the par-5 14th hole, Clark found the green in two shots and two-putted from 20 feet for a birdie to get to 12-under and open up a three-shot lead with four holes to play.

Taylor would go on to win the tournament, while Hatton finished in third place. Now, McClure has dialed in on the 2023 U.S. Open golf tournament and just locked in his one and done picks and PGA predictions. You can only see McClure's U.S. Open one and done picks at SportsLine. One of McClure's top one and done picks this week for the U.S. Open is world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler. As the betting favorite, Scheffler will likely be a popular pick in golf one and done pools, but McClure still sees value in targeting the red-hot 26-year-old. Scheffler has two wins in elevated events in 2023 and his track record at major championships over the last two years is unmatched. Scheffler enters the third major of the PGA Tour season ranked first in total strokes gained (2.544), strokes gained tee-to-green (2.775), strokes gained off-the-tee (1.096), and strokes gained on approach (1.207). He is also sixth in strokes gained around-the-green (0.458), and McClure feels strongly that Scheffler will be in contention entering the weekend.

Set a record for receptions (33) and tied for the second-most receiving yards (478) and receiving touchdowns (6) in a postseason in NFL history. Caught a touchdown in each of the Rams' four postseason games, making him the second player in league history to do that in a single postseason, along with former Arizona Cardinals wideout Larry Fitzgerald.
