Their interactions work, and Sophia Bush and Jason Isaacs seem like they could be a great pairing. The other characters around them fail to make much of an impression, except for Sam's mother and Griff's ex-wife, Vivian, who's an administrator at the hospital. Oh, and her new husband is also a doctor there. Adding to the intrigue, Sam's best friend Pippa sleeps with Griff! So, yes, there are some seriously intermingled lives at this hospital, and a fair number of twists in the pilot, but it's not clear where the show\u00a0goes from here, and\/or whether CBS viewers will be invested enough in its characters to care. FINAL RECOMMENDATION: Good Sam is a solid pilot script with a fair number of twists. The father-daughter relationship at its heart is compelling, and Sophia Bush and Jason Isaacs seem well cast. That said, it doesn't feel like it brings much new to the medical show genre overall, and feels far more soapy than we've come to expect from CBS.

It comes from in-house producer Jennie Snyder Urman, who created and executive produced Jane The Virgin. She currently serves as executive producer on the CW\u2019s Charmed and CBS\u2019s midseason sitcom Broke. The writer is Katie Wech, who previously worked with Urman as co-executive producer on Jane the Virgin. Prior to Good Sam, she wrote ABC's pilot The Hypnotist\u2019s Love Story, based on the Liane Moriarty book, which didn't make it to series for good reasons (read my script review). Most recently, she was one of the many writers hired for Fox\u2019s summer series BH90210. This is also the second year CBS has developed a drama pilot for Sophia Bush. In 2019, she headlined Surveillance, a suspenseful spy thriller (read my preview) which reportedly \"tested through the roof\" but was ultimately determined not to be a good fit for the network. Will Bush have better luck this time? Read on...

Here\u2019s how it works. Sophia Bush is back on TV for Good Sam, and here's how the CBS drama compares to other current medical shows. Spoilers ahead for the series premiere of Good Sam on CBS. CBS has officially gotten into the medical drama game with the debut of Good Sam, starring Sophia Bush in her big series regular return to network television after her exit from Chicago P.D. in 2017. As Dr. Sam Griffith, Bush \u2013\u00a0in her first turn playing a doctor on TV \u2013\u00a0takes on a leadership role at her hospital by becoming chief of surgery\u2026 with the complication that her father (played by Jason Isaacs) formerly held that position before ending up in a coma after being shot. When he awakes and must work under his daughter, there are more problems than just medical mysteries for Sam to deal with.\u00a0 The show packed a lot into the pilot episode to establish not only Sam and dad Rob \u201cGriff\u201d Griffith, but also her mom and her team of doctors who are used to following Griff\u2019s lead rather than Sam\u2019s. CBS was the only broadcast network without a medical drama prior to Good Sam, and recruiting a TV veteran like Sophia Bush and a big name like Jason Isaacs was a strong way to start.

In the fourth quarter alone, the company delivered more than 308,000 vehicles, a 71 percent increase from the quarter a year earlier. The overwhelming share of the deliveries were of the Model 3 sedan and the Model Y hatchback.

The company noted record production and delivery numbers for both Q4 and 2021, as well as record operating margin and a record low global vehicle inventory. The results, visualized below, are truly remarkable. Let's take a look at the details and then check out the outlook. Tesla produced 305,840 electric cars and delivered 308,650 during the period, which both are record numbers. The growth is associated with the Model 3\/Model Y, as the Model S\/Model X are in the ramp-up phase after a major refresh. As we can see, the global vehicle inventory (days of supply) further decreased to just 4 days. That's an amazing result and a true sign of how high the imbalance is between demand and supply. In 2021, Tesla produced 930,422 electric cars and delivered 936,222. It's a new record. The global vehicle inventory (days of supply) shows a fairly consistent decrease from 28 days in 2017, to 22 in 2018, 13-15 in 2019-2020 and 6 most recently.

What microchip shortage? EV maker Tesla, which it should be pointed out produces its own chips in-house, seems not to have been bothered by supply-chain issues all that much in 2021, delivering 936,172 vehicles in the year just ended, according to a report by finance news outlet Finbold. That represents a healthy 87 percent increase over 2020, when the company handed over 499,550 Teslas to customers. Even better for the company, it ended the year with a bang, racking up a record number of sales in the last quarter of 2021, or 308,600 units. Most of that total consisted of Model 3 and Model Y models, no surprise. It\u2019s the sixth consecutive quarter that it breaks its record for sales. In 2019, the automaker delivered 367,500 units, so annual sales growth, while not exponential, is clearly accelerating. The company has said in the past that one its main goals is to attain 50 percent sales growth year after year. Once upon a time, Tesla struggled mightily to hit its delivery targets, but no more. There\u2019s also no sign of that growth slowing down any time soon, even as all-electric rivals join the market by the month.

These platforms removed Trump due to concerns around his public comments following the Capitol Hill riots in January 2021.

On the television side, Succession won Best Television Series \u2013 Drama, while Hacks won for Best Television Series \u2013 Musical or Comedy. After a year of controversy about diversity, payola, and improper behavior endemic to the organization that culminated in the Globes losing its NBC broadcast, tonight\u2019s coverage and the subsequent congratulatory marketing from winners will be a good litmus test for if the beleaguered organization can rinse off some of the stink from a year of bad headlines and even more puzzling decisions. If you need a refresher on the ins and outs of what happened read our recap of how we got here. Over the last eight months, the HFPA has reformed its bylaws, implementing changes that address ethics and code of conduct, diversity, equity and inclusion, governance, and membership.

Just as it\u2019s done for many years, the HFPA gathered reporters at the Beverly Hilton to announce its picks for the 79th Golden Globes. But this time, there was no nationally televised morning-show live spot or any immediate celebrity celebrations. Hollywood mostly shrugged. The HFPA, which usually has a handful of movie stars make their announcement, turned instead to Snoop Dogg, who read the nominees behind sunglasses and a red hat during a live stream on the Globes' YouTube page. The majority of studios, public relations firms and A-list talent haven\u2019t engaged much this year with the group, which dropped its usual requirement that films be submitted for consideration. Critics have said it's too soon for the HFPA to return to business as usual. Some would rather see the Globes be gone for good. But the press association tried to maintain its perch in awards season on Monday, spreading nominations around to the likes of Will Smith (\"King Richard\"), Kristen Stewart (\"Spencer\"), \u201dWest Side Story\" breakthrough Rachel Zegler, Leonardo DiCaprio (\"Don't Look Up\"), Denzel Washington (\"The Tragedy of Macbeth\"), Ben Affleck (\"The Tender Bar\") and Lady Gaga (\"House of Gucci\").","Jaccard Noise_20":0.0,"Cosine Noise_20":0.2088244557,"EM Noise_20":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":0,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"Guillermo del Toro\u2019s PinocchioHildur","Noise_40 Document Index":"7","Noise_40 Document":"Brad Pitt, BabylonEddie Redmayne, The Good Nurse Angela Bassett, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever \u2013 WINNERKerry Condon, The Banshees of InisherinJamie Lee Curtis, Everything Everywhere All at OnceDolly De Leon, Triangle of SadnessCarey Mulligan, She Said John Lithgow, The Old ManJonathan Pryce, The CrownJohn Turturro, SeveranceTyler James Williams, Abbott Elementary \u2013 WINNERHenry Winkler, Barry Alexandre Desplat, Guillermo del Toro\u2019s PinocchioHildur Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir, Women TalkingJustin Hurwitz, Babylon \u2013 WINNERJohn Williams, The FabelmansCarter Burwell, The Banshees of Inisherin Carolina, Taylor Swift (Where the Crawdads Sing)Ciao Papa, Guillermo del Toro & Roeban Katz (Guillermo del Toro\u2019s Pinocchio)Hold My Hand, Lady Gaga and Bloodpop (Top Gun: Maverick)Lift Me Up, Tems, Ludwig G\u00f6ransson, Rihanna and Ryan Coogler (Black Panther: Wakanda Forever)Naatu Naatu, Kala Bhairava, M.

In support of boycotts of the HFPA by various media companies, actors, and other creatives over its lack of action to increase the membership diversity of the organization, the Golden Globes' regular broadcaster NBC declined to televise the 79th Golden Globe Awards. The HFPA ultimately chose to hold the presentation privately, with attendance limited to the organization's beneficiaries, and results announced via press release and highlighted on the Golden Globe Awards' social media pages.  The films Belfast and The Power of the Dog were tied for the most nominations, at seven each. The latter tied with Steven Spielberg's West Side Story and HBO's drama Succession with the most awards of the night, with three each.

While the HFPA has announced new policies for diversity, equity and inclusion, and inducted 21 new members, including several people of color as well as the addition of Neil Phillips as chief diversity officer, the future of the Golden Globes still remains uncertain.

The Verge reported on Thursday that Google is in the early stages of development on Project Iris, the codename for an upcoming augmented reality headset with a planned 2024 launch window. The report noted that the 2024 window isn\u2019t set in stone and the device could launch later. As for what Project Iris can actually do, details are scarce for the moment. Google is apparently developing Iris in a building that requires special access privileges just to get inside. However, here are a few key points we know about Iris right now based on The Verge\u2019s reporting: They look like ski goggles There isn\u2019t an external power source Exterior cameras place virtual objects in the user\u2019s real-life field of view It runs on Android It uses a custom processor like the Tensor chip in Pixel smartphones An internet connection may be required for some graphical elements Other details, such as whether it\u2019ll use Google\u2019s existing hardware brand names (i.e., Pixel or Nest) or a new name entirely, are still up in the air. It probably won\u2019t share a name with Google Glass, which still exists but is a purely enterprise product now.

Russia's President Vladimir Putin has given varying public explanations for why he launched the invasion. Here are the reasons Putin gave, how they match with reality, and the other likely reasons why Russia sent its armed forces into an independent, sovereign nation. Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union, before declaring itself an independent country, cementing the move in a referendum days before the USSR collapsed in December 1991. The country has maintained its independence ever since. But Putin still refers to Ukraine as Russian, and denies it's a nation in its own right. He told then-US President George W. Bush in 2008 that Ukraine wasn't even a country. Stephen Hall, a Russian politics expert at the University of Bath in the UK, said many Russians still hold this view, and that \"it isn't just the Kremlin.\" Hall said Russia sees Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, as the \"mother of Russian cities,\" and for Putin he can't have that being outside his own country. Hall added that Russia needs to claim Ukraine in order to back up its argument to being a great power that has existed for millennia. Without it \"Russia can't claim a thousand years of history because Kyiv was already in existence 1,200 years ago, when Moscow was a forest,\" he said.","Jaccard Noise_40":0.6666666667,"Cosine Noise_40":0.8160431981,"EM Noise_40":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":1,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"February 2022","Noise_60 Document Index":"9","Noise_60 Document":"\"Nazism is Russia-phobia to them. So the Ukrainians are Nazis because they're anti-Russian.\" Putin also promotes this Nazi idea to win support in the West, where people have always been \"susceptible\" to the argument that Ukraine has a Nazi problem, Hall said. He said Putin's strategy is partly \"throw things at the wall and see what sticks.\" According to Graham, there is no evidence that Putin was under public pressure to invade Ukraine, which suggests at least some of his reasoning was personal. All three experts said Putin's desire to be revered in history books likely motivated him to attack. Hall said Putin's anxiety is around \"am I going to be a footnote in Russian history or are they going to write books about me like they do Peter the Great, Catherine the Great, Stalin.\" Taylor agrees, saying that Putin sees himself as \"a great historic Russian leader restoring Russian lands, and he was thinking about his legacy as he turned 70.\" \"What have the great Czars done? They've expanded Russian territory,\" Graham said. Even with all of the above, why the invasion happened when it did is an intriguing question. Experts pointed to multiple reasons why Russia invaded in February 2022. One was the arrival of Zelenskyy, who came to power in 2019 after a career as a comedian and actor. Putin believed that in Zelenskyy \"he had someone he could manipulate in Ukraine,\" Hall said.","Jaccard Noise_60":0.3333333333,"Cosine Noise_60":0.7539719343,"EM Noise_60":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_60":0,"Noise_80 Predicted Answer":"3 April","Noise_80 Document Index":"0","Noise_80 Document":"173] On 3 April, following the retreat of Russian forces from Kyiv, Russia expanded its attack on Southern Ukraine further west, with bombardment and strikes against Odesa, Mykolaiv, and the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant.[174][175]  In the east, Russian troops attempted to capture Kharkiv, less than 35 kilometres (22\u00a0mi) from the Russian border,[176][177] and met strong Ukrainian resistance.

It was directed by Hidetaka Miyazaki with worldbuilding provided by fantasy writer George R. R. Martin. It was released for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X\/S on February 25 by FromSoftware in Japan and Bandai Namco Entertainment internationally. Players control a customizable player character who is on a quest to repair the Elden Ring and become the new Elden Lord.  Elden Ring is presented through a third-person perspective; players freely roam its interactive open world. The six main areas are traversed using the player character's steed Torrent as the primary mode of travel. Linear, hidden dungeons can be explored to find useful items. Players can use several types of weapons and magic spells, including non-direct engagement enabled by stealth mechanics. Throughout the game's world, checkpoints enable fast travel and allow players to improve their attributes using an in-game currency called Runes. Elden Ring has an online multiplayer mode in which players can join each other for cooperative and player-versus-player combat.  During planning, FromSoftware wanted to create an open-world game with gameplay similar to Dark Souls; the company wanted Elden Ring to act as an evolution of the self-titled debut of the series. Miyazaki admired the work of Martin, whose contributions he hoped would produce a more accessible narrative than those of the company's earlier games.","Jaccard Noise_40":1.0,"Cosine Noise_40":0.9999999404,"EM Noise_40":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":1,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"February 25, 2022","Noise_60 Document Index":"3","Noise_60 Document":"Feb 13, 2022 ...

Swiatek, who looked extremely nervous before the match began, looked anything but once the rackets started swinging. She came out strong, showing off all the skills we know her for: explosive movement, pinpoint precision and a soft touch. By comparison, Jabeur, who looked comfortable and happy before the match started, came out looking flat and tentative. It wasn't until Swiatek was up 3-0 that Jabeur got on the board. Then, in the fifth game of the first set, Jabeur hit four winners, each one perfectly placed along the singles sideline. All Swiatek could do with those is watch them bounce as Jabeur narrowed the gap at 3-2. Unfortunately, that was the last game Jabeur won in the first set. Swiatek was able to reach balls that most people couldn't even try for, while Jabeur couldn't stop hitting the ball into the net at the most vital moments. Swiatek claimed the first set in 30 minutes flat, and made it look as effortless as ever.","Jaccard Noise_80":0.0,"Cosine Noise_80":0.6559194326,"EM Noise_80":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":0,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"Osaka","Noise_100 Document Index":"3","Noise_100 Document":"Apr 2, 2022 ...

The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus are available in six colors: Blue, Purple, Midnight, Starlight, Yellow, and Product Red.[24] Purple is a new color replacing Pink used on the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini.

Both models have 6 GB of RAM, an increase over the previous iPhone 13 and 13 mini models' 4 GB of RAM. The iPhone 14 and 14 Plus have the same IP68 rating for dust and water resistance as their predecessors.[6]  The iPhone 14 and 14 Plus use a 5-nanometer Apple-designed system on a chip, the A15 Bionic, while the iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max have a faster A16 Bionic.[26][27]  The iPhone 14's A15 chip has a 6-core CPU, 5-core GPU, and a 16-core Neural Engine.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.9999999404,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"A15","Noise_20 Document Index":"5","Noise_20 Document":"By  Mitchell Clark Apple has announced that the regular iPhone won\u2019t be getting a new processor this year \u2014 instead, the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus will be powered by Apple\u2019s A15 Bionic chip, the same chip that\u2019s in the iPhone 13 Pro \u2014 though it does have a bit more grunt than the A15 that was in the regular iPhone 13 and the $429 iPhone SE from earlier this year, thanks to an extra GPU core. This is the first time that Apple\u2019s not updating to a new processor for one of its flagship iPhones since the 2008 iPhone 3G, which featured virtually the same internals as the original iPhone. The iPhone 14 Pro, meanwhile, has an A16 processor, which the company says is more power efficient, even when doing intensive tasks. The raw specs of the new chip are similar, though \u2014 like the A15 in the regular 14, it has a six-core CPU, a five-core GPU, and a 16-core Neural Engine. The new version just has better cores, according to Apple.  The decision not to update the chipset for the standard iPhone 14 isn\u2019t exactly a surprising one. Analysts like Ming-Chi Kuo and reporters like Mark Gurman have been predicting the move for months, and the chip shortage isn\u2019t quite over yet.

The front-facing camera also has autofocus for the first time.[30]  The cameras use Apple's latest computational photography engine, called Smart HDR 4. Users can also choose from a range of photographic styles during capture, including rich contrast, vibrant, warm, and cool. Apple clarifies this is different from a filter because it works intelligently with the image processing algorithm during capture to apply local adjustments to an image, and the effects will be baked into the photos, unlike filters which can be removed after applying.[6]  The camera app contains Cinematic Mode, which allows users to rack focus between subjects and create (simulate) shallow depth of field using software algorithms. It is supported on wide and front-facing cameras in 4K at 30 fps.[6]  The iPhone 14 is equipped with slightly longer battery life compared to the iPhone 13.

When I review a particularly ugly Windows laptop, I\u2019ll often refer to it as having a \u201claptop cart\u201d look. If you were a student at any point after the early 2000s, you probably understand why. The laptops that schools provide to elementary and middle school kids are famously ugly, old, and terrible in all kinds of ways.\u00a0 With the Surface Laptop SE, which is tailor-made for education and being sold only to schools, Microsoft is trying a different tack. The Surface Laptop SE is a cute laptop. It looks like a miniature version of the company\u2019s flagship Surface Laptop line, complete with the recognizable logo on the lid and bottom bezel. It\u2019s quite light, at just 2.45 pounds.

Unlike most other computing devices, the Microsoft Surface Laptop SE is designed to be fully accessible for onsite repairs of common components, so students likely won\u2019t have to wait to get back to work if their SE breaks. With no moving parts and a strong chassis, the Microsoft Surface Laptop SE is about as tough as a laptop can be without adding specifically ruggedized components. And while elementary education is hardly a war zone, younger students likely don\u2019t treat their devices with as much care as adults. Microsoft talked with school administrators, teachers and IT professionals working with students ranging in age from kindergarten to eighth grade. It quickly became apparent that three key items \u2014 the screen, keyboard and battery \u2014 were the most commonly damaged or broken components on classroom laptops, especially in devices that also went home with students. Those three components made up 85 percent of all repair orders, and the repair process itself was also a detriment to education. Normally, broken units must be shipped to a factory or repair center that might take a week or longer to ship the device back \u2014 meaning broken laptops were not available to students for extended periods. The shipping costs also were often the responsibility of the school. Microsoft has revolutionized that process with the Microsoft Surface Laptop SE.","Jaccard Noise_20":0.5,"Cosine Noise_20":0.4907352328,"EM Noise_20":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":1,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"11.6 inchesMAX","Noise_40 Document Index":"5","Noise_40 Document":"For example, it\u2019s easy to create a lesson plan that pairs the Edge browser with\u00a0a videoconferencing window\u00a0using the 720p-resolution webcam.

The slap was in response to Rock's joke about Smith's wife Jada Pinkett Smith's shaved head, which she had been shaving since 2021 due to alopecia areata. Smith returned to his seat and shouted profanity at Rock, who briefly responded, but completed his presentation without further interruption.  Later that evening, Smith won Best Actor and apologized to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and other nominees, but not to Rock, in his acceptance speech. The next day, he issued an apology to Rock and the Academy through social media. Smith resigned his Academy membership on April 1, facing a potential suspension or expulsion, and was banned from attending Academy events for 10 years, effective April 8.  Live television broadcasts in the United States mostly muted the incident due to federal censorship laws. However, uncensored international footage went viral on social media; an excerpt from the Australian broadcast became one of the most-viewed online videos in the first 24 hours.

In July, Musk announced his intention to terminate the agreement, asserting that Twitter had breached their agreement by refusing to crack down on spambot accounts. The company filed a lawsuit against Musk in the Delaware Court of Chancery shortly thereafter, with a trial scheduled for the week of October 17. Weeks before the trial was set to begin, Musk reversed course, announcing that he would move forward with the acquisition. The deal was closed on October 27, with Musk immediately becoming Twitter's new owner and CEO. Twitter was taken private and merged into a new parent company named X Corp.","Jaccard Noise_100":1.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.9033486843,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":1}

Scottie Scheffler dominated the final three rounds of the 2022 Masters en route to a green jacket, record $2.7 million payout and further enshrinement as the hottest golfer on the planet, carding a 10-under 278 to win his first career major on Sunday.  Scheffler became the fifth golfer to enter Augusta National ranked No. 1 in the world and go on to win the Masters, joining Ian Woosnam (1991), Fred Couples (1992), Tiger Woods (2001-02) and Dustin Johnson (2020).  The victory was his fourth on the PGA Tour this season, making him the first golfer since Arnold Palmer in 1960 -- and only the second ever -- to win as many events including the Masters in that span of time to begin a season, according to Justin Ray.  Scheffler is on such a heater that he actually won all four of those PGA Tour events in just a 57-day span, marking the shortest stretch from a first to fourth victory in PGA Tour history. This after failing to claim a victory in his first 70 events on the PGA Tour.","Jaccard Noise_60":1.0,"Cosine Noise_60":1.0,"EM Noise_60":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_60":1,"Noise_80 Predicted Answer":"Scheffler","Noise_80 Document Index":"7","Noise_80 Document":"For Australian Smith, who had pushed Scheffler so hard, his charge for a debut major felt apart on the treacherous par-three 12th hole when his tee shot found the water and he had to settle for a triple-bogey.            While Smith\u2019s confidence seemed to vanish, Scheffler remained steadfast, continuing to pick up pars and the odd birdie to maintain his sizeable lead.            His closest challenger eventually became McIlroy, who shot up the leaderboard following an outstanding eight-under par 64 to claim the clubhouse lead.            Even with the pressure of a potential Masters title on the line, though, Scheffler did not buckle, instead adding to his lead over the 14th and 15th holes to stretch it to five with just three holes remaining.            And from there, despite a wayward drive on the 17th, Scheffler managed to calm his nerves, right up until the final green on the 72nd hole.            With a big lead and his 2022 Masters champion title almost certainly wrapped up, Scheffler showed he was human as he four-putted \u2013 missing two from close range \u2013 before rolling home the winning putt and sparking scenes of celebration.

A blog post on Nintendo's website revealed that players who have save data for Splatoon 2 stored on their Nintendo Switch will be given somewhat of a head start in the new game. Three main weapons can be unlocked immediately instead of having to wait until a certain level has been reached, meaning players can keep battling with their favourites from Splatoon 2 without having to rank up a ton first. Anarchy Battles - Splatoon 3's new ranked mode - will also be available from the start, and players will be matched in all modes with players who shared a similar skill level in Splatoon 2. Nintendo also states that these players will start the game with a higher rank depending on their rank in the second game, but didn't specify if the level would be matched exactly, if players would be granted a few bonus ranks, or whatever else. \"Five out of five Squid Research Lab scientists recommend transferring data from Splatoon 2 if you have it,\" the post said. While all of these features will eventually be available to brand new Splatoon players, it appears Nintendo's intention is to allow veteran players to get straight back into the competitive action they experienced in the five year old Splatoon 2.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.0187721308,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

Some of his changes have sparked concerns inside and outside the network. And for more on that, we have NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik. Hey, David.DAVID FOLKENFLIK, BYLINE: Hey, Ailsa.CHANG: OK. So tell us, who is CNN's new CEO and chairman Chris Licht, and how does he want to reshape CNN exactly?FOLKENFLIK: Sure. Chris Licht came over after stints at CBS where he oversaw the Colbert \"Late Show.\" And he had also been at CBS News, and before that, MSNBC. He's promising in this incarnation at CNN that he's going to make the channel less opinion driven, less perhaps focused on Donald Trump as the one true story that they really rode during the Trump era. This has been a passion of Discovery CEO David Zaslav and Discovery's biggest investor, John Malone. Let's not forget that they just took over Time Warner and CNN recently.","Jaccard Noise_80":1.0,"Cosine Noise_80":0.9999999404,"EM Noise_80":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":1,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"Licht","Noise_100 Document Index":"0","Noise_100 Document":"Zaslav had stressed that he didn\u2019t care \u2014 at least not much \u2014 about CNN\u2019s current ratings, revenue or profitability. He recognized that it would take years to reposition and rebuild the network. But even he had his limits. AT&T\u2019s board had approved an ambitious budget of $350 million for CNN+, much of it already spent by the time Mr. Licht arrived. Many more millions would be needed. With Warner facing pressure from Wall Street to find $3 billion in savings, on April 21, Mr. Licht killed the streaming service after less than a month on air. In an effort to restore morale and calm anxiety, Mr. Licht assured CNN employees at a network-wide town hall meeting on May 5 that Warner Bros. Discovery didn\u2019t anticipate further job cuts at CNN because there was no overlap between the news network and Discovery\u2019s cable channels, and thus there wasn\u2019t anyone else doing the same jobs that would need to be cut.  In a series of additional town hall meetings, most of them leaked almost immediately to The New York Times and other news outlets, Mr. Licht also laid the groundwork for the network\u2019s shift to broader, less political and less partisan coverage. This was not, he stressed repeatedly, a move to the \u201ccenter,\u201d a boring, political neutral zone that Mr. Licht wasn\u2019t even sure existed.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.5,"Cosine Noise_100":0.3179873228,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

Macron, the centrist incumbent, won with 58.5 percent of the vote in Sunday's second-round runoff, compared with 41.5 percent for Le Pen, his nationalist rival, official results show. Macron triumphed decisively, although by a smaller margin than in 2017, when he won by more than 30 percentage points to became France's youngest president. While she fell short of the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace again in her third presidential run, Le Pen has secured the most votes ever for a French far-right candidate. In a victory speech at Paris' Champ de Mars, Macron thanked his supporters and promised a more \"independent France\" and \"stronger Europe.\" \u201cI also know that many of our compatriots voted for me today, not to support the ideas I hold but to block those of the extreme right,\" he said. \"And I want to thank them here and tell them that I am aware that this vote binds me for the years to come.\" \"From now on, I am no longer the candidate of one camp but the president of all,\u201d he added.

After polls closed across France at 8 p.m. local time (2 p.m. ET), the polling companies Opinionway, Harris and IFOP worked with media organizations to publish projected results based on early voting patterns. The interior ministry announced the final results Monday, with Macron winning 58.5 percent of the vote to Le Pen's 41.5 percent. The campaign was beset by apathy, with many voters dissatisfied with both candidates and the turnout looking likely to be around 2 points lower than it was five years ago.  Politicians across the political spectrum will also likely reflect on the huge number of abstentions, which reached a record 28 percent of the electorate. But ultimately Macron, 44, has won a clear victory that surpassed his polling numbers, surging in the final stages to earn five more years at the helm of one of the continent's two major powers.

But a key question for Macron will be whether most of the people who voted for him embrace his platform, or whether they really wanted to prevent a Le Pen victory. There\u2019s not nearly the same level of enthusiasm for him as when he first ran in 2017, launching his own centrist political movement and becoming France\u2019s youngest president. The turnout rate on Sunday was projected to be 72 percent, according to France\u2019s public broadcaster, which would make it the lowest in the second round of a presidential election in half a century. He has disappointed some of his supporters by pushing through tax cuts for the wealthy, being less ambitious than some hoped on climate change, and tacking right on immigration in ways that were calculated to appeal to Le Pen voters but that also echoed the messages from migration-skeptic leaders in Hungary and elsewhere.

The iPhone 14 Pro has three rear cameras: a main wide-angle camera, an ultrawide and a telephoto camera with 3x optical zoom. The lens on the main camera has a wider focal length, going from a 26mm equivalent on previous iPhone models to a 24mm one. It isn't drastically different, but it helps get more of the scene into the frame.   Just a cat under mixed lighting, as captured by the iPhone 14 Pro. The main camera also gets a new,\u00a0larger, 48-megapixel sensor. Though more megapixels doesn't necessarily mean better photos, Apple divides the pixels into groups of four and combines the four in each group into one larger pixel. This technique is called pixel binning, and it's been used on Android phones for years. The results are brighter photos that have less image noise (and as a bonus, less noise-reduction blur).\u00a0Apple's new imagining pipeline, called the Photonic Engine, takes things further and helps improve color accuracy and protect details. Take a look below at a photo I shot of a streetcar just after sunset. Pay special attention to the texture of the pavement and the details in the leaves and building behind the streetcar.","Jaccard Noise_40":1.0,"Cosine Noise_40":1.0,"EM Noise_40":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":1,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"12","Noise_60 Document Index":"3","Noise_60 Document":"Apple did not go into great detail about the camera hardware changes here, but thankfully Techinsights took the entire camera package apart. The new sensor, at 40mm\u00b2, is almost 50% larger than the iPhone 13 Pro\u2019s 26.9 mm\u00b2 sensor. While its aperture is slightly \u2018slower\u2019 (that is, smaller) the larger sensor compensates. How does the sensor and lens change stack up in practice? The iPhone 14 Pro easily outperforms the previous iPhone, creating far sharper shots: In multiple shots in various conditions, the shots were far more detailed and exhibited less visible processing than comparable iPhone 13 Pro shots: A nice side benefit of a larger sensor is a bit more shallow depth of field. At a 13mm full-frame equivalent, you really can\u2019t expect too much subject separation, but this shot shows some nice blurry figures in the background.  I believe that both Apple\u2019s new Photonic Engine and the larger sensor are contributing to a lot more detail in the frame, which makes a cropped image like the above shot possible. The \u2018my point of view\u2019 perspective that the ultra-wide provides puts you in the action, and a lack of detail makes every shot less immersive.  Is it all perfect? Well, comparably, with the main camera getting ever-better, it is still fairly soft and lacking detail.

{"Query":"How much does it cost to rent a tool kit for Apple device repairs?","Correct Answer":["49"],"Noise_0 Predicted Answer":"$49","Noise_0 Document Index":"0","Noise_0 Document":"I perused the instructions for my iPhone 12, which was working fine but was probably due for a new battery. The steps seemed straightforward enough: Use a machine to melt the glue and pry off the phone\u2019s screen, remove the screws and battery, use another machine to install the new battery, then put everything back together and use a third machine to press together the phone. I made the charge for the self-repair program to my credit card. It included a $49 rental fee for the tool kit, the $69 battery, $2 for glue and 15 cents for some screws, along with a $1,210 hold for renting the repair machines. After seven days, those tools would have to be shipped back to Apple with a prepaid label, and the old battery could also be traded in for a $24 credit. With no experience repairing phones, I decided to get some practice. I ordered a $45 kit from iFixit, a site that publishes instructions and sells D.I.Y. tools to repair gadgets, so I could first replace the battery in my wife\u2019s four-year-old iPhone XS. The iFixit kit arrived with some tweezers, a screwdriver, plastic picks and a suction cup to remove the screen.

Shipping two 40-pound Pelicans can\u2019t be cheap To me, those giant Pelican cases are the proof. It would cost Apple a fortune to ship 79 pounds of equipment to individual homes all over the country, even with corporate discounts. The Verge is obviously far, far smaller than Apple, but it would cost us upwards of $200 just to return those cases to their sender.

As a sequel and replacement to the 2016 hero shooter Overwatch, the game intends a shared environment for player-versus-player (PvP) modes while initially having plans for introducing persistent cooperative modes, though the plans were later scrapped in 2023, focusing the game on its PvP elements. A major change in PvP modes was to reduce team sizes from six to five. Several major characters were also reworked. Overwatch 2 is free-to-play on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X\/S in early access on October 4 and features full cross-platform play.  Overwatch 2 is a hero shooter, where players are split into two teams and select a \"hero\" from a roster of 35 characters. Characters are organized into a \"damage\" class, responsible for offensive efforts; a \"support\" class, responsible for healing and buffing; and a \"tank\" class, responsible for creating space for their team. Each character has a unique set of skills, made up of active, passive, and ultimate abilities. Overwatch 2, like its predecessor, primarily centers on player versus player (PvP) combat across several different modes and maps, and includes both casual and ranked competitive matches.  The original Overwatch was designed for six-on-six team combat, with two of each class on a team.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.3333333333,"Cosine Noise_100":0.8057020903,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories. While many big games have been delayed recently, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is moving in the opposite direction: Nintendo announced that the sci-fi RPG will now launch on July 29th instead of the previously planned September release. No specific reason was given for the change. The game will be a Nintendo Switch exclusive. Xenoblade Chronicles 3 will be the first main game in the series since its predecessor debuted on the Switch in 2017 and Nintendo first announced it earlier this year as part of the February 2022 Nintendo Direct. Like the rest of the series, the new game takes place in an expansive sci-fi universe; in addition to the release date, Nintendo also revealed a new trailer (embedded above) to further tease the story and world. The change in release date comes at a time when plenty of major releases have been delayed for various reasons, including the challenge of developing games remotely during the pandemic. Most recently, this has affected games like Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League and Nintendo\u2019s own sequel to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, both of which have been delayed until 2023.  \/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.","Jaccard Noise_20":0.3333333333,"Cosine Noise_20":0.9852647781,"EM Noise_20":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":0,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"July 29, 2022","Noise_40 Document Index":"3","Noise_40 Document":"According to the official Nintendo support page detailing when new games are added to the eShop, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is expected to launch at 9 PM PT the night before launch (July 28).

The conversational AI is designed to converse with humans about \u201cnearly any topic.\u201d Like Blender Bot 2, the latest upgrade also features the ability to browse the internet, is trained on the OPT-175B language model (which is 58x the size of Blender Bot 2), and has long-term memory.\u00a0 It also eliminates the limitations such as forgetfulness (which surprisingly makes machine learning models efficient when not used in chatbots). It has self-learning capabilities that allow it \u201cto improve its conversational skills and safety through feedback from people who chat with it, focusing on helpful feedback while avoiding learning from unhelpful or dangerous responses.\u201d Well, yes and no. While it is entirely plausible that the underlying AI tech helps it to \u2018learn,\u2019 it seems like Blender Bot 3 cannot differentiate between what is acceptable and what is not. At least that\u2019s what its recent responses to some people conveyed.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.6666666667,"Cosine Noise_0":0.8934799433,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Aug 5, 2022","Noise_20 Document Index":"6","Noise_20 Document":"Aug 5, 2022 ...

That is the core of its business model, and that\u2019s what drives its monopoly power and profit,\u201d says Evan Greer, director of the nonprofit digital rights organization Fight for the Future. \u201cAmazon wants to have its hands everywhere, and acquiring a company that\u2019s essentially built on mapping the inside of people\u2019s homes seems like a natural extension of the surveillance reach that Amazon already has.\u201d Amazon declined to respond to questions about how it would use iRobot data, but company spokesperson Alexandra Miller provided a statement that claimed the company had been a good steward of customer information. \"Customer trust is something we have worked hard to earn\u2014and work hard to keep\u2014every day,\u201d the statement said.  Amazon has a track record of making or acquiring technology that makes those concerned with data privacy uneasy. In 2020, Amazon introduced a home security drone, and last month Ring, a company that\u2019s forged partnerships with thousands of police and fire departments, admitted to sharing home video footage with law enforcement without a warrant. Should law enforcement or governments demand access, so much data about people in the hands of a single company poses the threat of being a single point of failure for democracy and human rights, Greer says.

The increase follows several others, including one just months ago, when the cost rose from $10,000 to $12,000. This latest hike is tied to a software update (FSD Beta 10.69.2), which improves overall driving smoothness through turns, enhances pedestrian and animal detection, and enables a creep-into-intersection function. Full Self-Driving is Tesla\u2019s disingenuously named suite of advanced driver-assistance features. Currently, it includes all the functionality of Basic and Enhanced Autopilot, plus the ability to slow the vehicle to a stop as it approaches red traffic signals and signs. If you see little importance or utility in the last of those things, you can still get the bulk of Tesla\u2019s magic with Enhanced Autopilot. It costs a relative bargain, at $6,000, and gives your vehicle the ability to park itself and navigate a highway route from on-ramp to off-ramp (including automatic lane changes) with minimal driver involvement. It also includes Summon, which allows the driver to direct a car into or out of a tight parking space while standing outside the vehicle, and Smart Summon, which enables the vehicle to wind its way around objects (such as in a parking lot) to meet the driver.","Jaccard Noise_20":1.0,"Cosine Noise_20":0.9999999404,"EM Noise_20":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":1,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"$15,000","Noise_40 Document Index":"2","Noise_40 Document":"Tesla has officially raised the price of its Full Self-Driving (FSD) package to $15,000, as CEO Elon Musk promised.

But that\u2019s not really what you are buying. Since Musk has made it clear that he believes true self-driving is worth a lot more than $15,000, he says that the price will keep going up leading to self-driving. Therefore, buying FSD right now at $15,000 is more of a bet that Tesla will deliver true self-driving and that you are getting it at a discount over the final price right now. However, that\u2019s a bet because the path from what FSD Beta is right now to a self-driving system safe enough that Tesla would take responsibility for it is not clear.

Customers who order the Full Self Driving, or FSD, software before Sept. 5 will receive the product under the current price, Musk, Tesla's CEO, said in the tweet. The $3K price bump arrives as Tesla introduces FSD beta 10.69, a new iteration that boasts \"improved overall driving smoothness\" and \"reduced false slowdowns near crosswalks,\" according to the company. The FSD software doesn't make a car fully self-driving. Rather, users must remain focused on the road and keep their hands on the driving wheel. The Autopilot system, meanwhile, offers navigation to and from user-provided destinations, as well as suggestions for lane changes and other maneuvers to optimize a trip. Tesla has come under sharp criticism over its marketing of the FSD software and Autopilot.

R. Martin and Ryan Condal for HBO. A prequel to Game of Thrones (2011\u20132019), it is the second television series in the A Song of Ice and Fire franchise. Condal and Miguel Sapochnik served as the showrunners for the first season. Based on parts of Martin's 2018 book Fire & Blood, the series begins about 100 years after the Seven Kingdoms are united by the Targaryen Conquest, nearly 200 years before the events of Game of Thrones, and 172 years before the birth of Daenerys Targaryen. Featuring an ensemble cast, the show portrays the events leading up to the beginning of the decline of House Targaryen, a devastating war of succession known as the \"Dance of the Dragons\".  House of the Dragon received a straight-to-series order in October 2019, with casting beginning in July 2020 and principal photography starting in April 2021 in the United Kingdom. The series premiered on August 21, 2022, with the first season consisting of ten episodes. Five days after its premiere, the series was renewed for a second season.

Williams edged finalists Max Duggan of TCU, C.J. Stroud of Ohio State and Stetson Bennett IV of Georgia -- all quarterbacks -- to become the Trojans' first Heisman winner since running back Reggie Bush, who was later forced to vacate his 2005 award. Williams passed for 4,075 yards, 37 touchdowns and just four interceptions while completing 66.1% of his passes this season. He guided USC to an 11-2 record and appearance in the Pac-12 Championship Game where he played through injuries in a loss to Utah. His victory gives USC eight Heismans, most among any program in the nation. However, given the Heisman Trust and NCAA no longer recognize Bush as having won the trophy in 2005, USC will be listed with seven Heismans, tying it for most all-time with Notre Dame, Ohio State and Oklahoma.","Jaccard Noise_40":1.0,"Cosine Noise_40":0.9999999404,"EM Noise_40":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":1,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"Stroud","Noise_60 Document Index":"4","Noise_60 Document":"Duggan's heroics in the Big 12 title game last week weren't enough, however, as TCU came up just short in an overtime loss to Kansas State, but the quarterback's hearty effort clearly captured a lot of voters' attention.

The club was founded in 1970 and currently plays in Ligue 1, the first division of French football. Toulouse plays its home matches at the Stadium de Toulouse located within the city.  Les Pitchouns are the current holders of the Coupe de France, and have won the second tier Ligue 2 on three occasions.[2] Toulouse have participated in European competition five times, including in 2007 when they qualified for the UEFA Champions League for the first time.[3] They are set to participate in the 2023\u201324 UEFA Europa League, following their victory in the preceding year's Coupe de France.   The president of Toulouse FC is Damien Comolli, who succeeded the French businessman Olivier Sadran who took over the club following its bankruptcy in 2001 which resulted in it being relegated to the Championnat National. The club has served as a springboard for several players, most notably the World Cup-winning goalkeeper Fabien Barthez, international strikers Andr\u00e9-Pierre Gignac[4] and Martin Braithwaite.  The city was left without a big side in 1967 when Toulouse FC sold its players and place in the French top flight to Paris outfit Red Star, but three years later a new club, Union Sportive Toulouse, rose from the ashes.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.4334779978,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":0,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"RedBird Capital Partners","Noise_20 Document Index":"0","Noise_20 Document":"Barcelona also faces a ban that could stretch to multiple years if a match-fixing allegation emerges in the so-called \u201cCaso Negreira\u201d case.

A disciplinary case also is opened that can apply further sanctions. Turkish club Fenerbahce ended up missing three seasons because of fixing allegations in 2011. Milan and Toulouse, owned by RedBird Capital Partners, are not alone facing UEFA questions about multi-club owners having \u201cdecisive influence\u201d over two clubs. Brighton and Union Saint-Gilloise have close ties through owner Tony Bloom and both are in the Europa League.

The film was set to be directed by Gore Verbinski, director of the Pirates of the Caribbean series. However, it was announced on August 24, 2009 that because of budget issues, and the prospect of filming some footage overseas, Verbinski had dropped out as director.[1] Verbinski remained as the film's producer, and was working with the new director, Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, who is best known for his horror sequel 28 Weeks Later, to manage the film's budget. The pre-production on the BioShock film was cancelled sometime in late 2010 or early 2011.  In 2022 it was announced that the film was back in development and would be a Netflix exclusive film. That same year, the film found both it's director and writer in Francis Lawrence and Michael Green respectively.  In early July of 2010 Verbinski announced that he was still active on the film, and that he and Fresnadillo were working to reduce the budget and produce the film with an R-rating.[2]  In February 2011 Verbinski confirmed that pre-production on the BioShock film has stopped because no studio was willing to invest in such an expensive project with a violent theme.[3]","Jaccard Noise_40":1.0,"Cosine Noise_40":0.9999999404,"EM Noise_40":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":1,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"Francis Lawrence","Noise_60 Document Index":"3","Noise_60 Document":"Back in February, Netflix announced it was working with 2K and Take-Two Interactive for a live-action movie based on the BioShock series.

I don't want to get into it too much now because it's pretty early on in the process, but I certainly have not felt stifled in any way, or sent in any directions with Netflix. I mean, basically me and Cameron [MacConomy] who works with me, and Michael are getting to do what we want to do, which is great. A lot of it is staying really true to the game itself, and we're talking to Take-Two [Interactive] and Ken Levine. Despite the confidence, Lawrence is fully aware of how video game movies have failed in the past. Still, he's convinced that BioShock offers something meatier to the table that can survive the jump to the big screen. When asked if he knew about the disconnect in adaptations, he added: No, I do know what you mean.

In rather tedious news, Tencent and Sony Interactive Entertainment have acquired partial stakes in FromSoftware. More specifically, Tencent has 16.25% of shares and Sony Interactive Entertainment has 14.09% of shares in FromSoftware. The reason why this is boring is that Kadokawa is still the main owner (with 69.66% of the shares) and these new share acquisitions are both non-controlling stakes. In short, nothing has changed and neither Tencent nor Sony have any real decision-making power here. So if you were thinking that Sony would be able to force platform exclusivity for all future FromSoftware titles, then you would be wrong. This will just be business as usual, except that FromSoftware may have some more capital to play around with. One potentially interesting point here is that the money accrued from this will help FromSoftware bolster its publishing plans for the future. This is noteworthy because FromSoftware actually publishes its own games in Japan, so moving that to be more of a global endeavor would be better for all concerned. In that, in the past many of FromSoftware\u2019s games were released internationally by publishers that neither cared nor understood their games.

Then, Blake's wife and No Doubt leading lady, Gwen, shared that she was also returning to The Voice with her own singing snippet. The GXVE beauty entrepreneur was previously a coach on the NBC series for five other seasons, including 7, 9, 12, 17 and 19. Last but not least, Camila confirmed her attendance with a brief but telling cameo in a TikTok duet. With that, it was official that The Kelly Clarkson Show host and season 21 coach Ariana Grande would be departing from The Voice.  Kelly hasn't addressed leaving the show, but her departure isn't completely out of the blue. The American Song Contest co-host previously shared that she wanted to spend more time with her kids (8-year-old daughter River and 6-year-old son Remington) \u2014 even if it meant switching up her schedule to do so.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":1.0,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Camila Cabello","Noise_20 Document Index":"1","Noise_20 Document":"She continued on the topic of her and Shelton's work dynamic, \"[It's] kinda easy and flawless and normal.

The acquisition is Google's second-largest ever, surpassed only by the company's $12.5 billion buyout of Motorola ten years ago.

In a trailer, Nintendo revealed the new name and the game\u2019s May 12th, 2023 release date for the Nintendo Switch.

It is the best-selling Zelda game and one of the best-selling video games of all time, with 32.35 million copies sold by 2023.  Breath of the Wild is considered one of the greatest video games of all time. Journalists described it as a landmark in open-world design for its emphasis on experimentation, physics-based sandbox, and emergent gameplay. Numerous developers cited Breath of the Wild as inspiration, and it is a popular point of comparison among open-world games. A spin-off, Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity, was released in 2020 while a sequel, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, was released in 2023.  Breath of the Wild is an open world action-adventure game. Players are tasked with exploring the kingdom of Hyrule while controlling Link. Breath of the Wild encourages nonlinear gameplay, which is illustrated by the game's lack of defined entrances or exits to areas,[1] scant instruction given to the player, and encouragement to explore freely.[2] Breath of the Wild introduces a consistent physics engine to the Zelda series, letting players approach problems in different ways rather than trying to find a single solution.[3] The game also integrates a \"chemistry engine\" that defines the physical properties of most objects and governs how they interact with the player and one another.","Jaccard Noise_40":1.0,"Cosine Noise_40":1.0,"EM Noise_40":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":1,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"Tears of the Kingdom","Noise_60 Document Index":"5","Noise_60 Document":"Our latest look at Tears of the Kingdom is apparently the very last trailer that will be released for the game.

From the latest trailer, it's clear that something goes wrong during this investigation, Ganon is resurrected, and Link must save the day. Back in 2019, Zelda series producer Eiji Aonuma revealed that the game is going to have a darker tone than Breath of the Wild, and will even be \"a little bit darker\" than Majora's Mask (via IGN). Trailers certainly support this, with what looks like Ganondorf's corpse being resurrected by a disembodied hand, and seemingly imagery from 2006's Twilight Princess, which saw Hyrule turned into a bleak shadow realm \u2013 largely in response to the far cheerier and cartoonish The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker.","Jaccard Noise_60":1.0,"Cosine Noise_60":1.0,"EM Noise_60":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_60":1,"Noise_80 Predicted Answer":"Tears of the Kingdom","Noise_80 Document Index":"4","Noise_80 Document":"Sep 20, 2022 ...

As in recent years, some of the presentations at the conference will be for papers accepted by the Transactions of the ACL (TACL) and Computational Linguistics (CL) journals. EMNLP 2023 will follow EMNLP 2022 and ACL 2023 and go with a hybrid format with respect to ARR. This means that while EMNLP will accept ARR-reviewed papers, it will also accept submissions directly to EMNLP. However, in order to keep the review load on the community as a whole manageable, we need to ask authors to decide up-front if they want to be reviewed through ARR or EMNLP.

It will be possible to make minor edits to the title and abstract until the full paper submission deadline, but you cannot change authors and subject areas. Submissions with \u201cplaceholder\u201d abstracts will be removed without consideration. Important: if you miss the abstract submission deadline, then you cannot submit the full paper. Mandatory Discussion of Limitations We believe that it is also important to discuss the limitations of your work, in addition to its strengths. EMNLP 2023 requires all papers to have a clear discussion of limitations, in a dedicated section titled \u201cLimitations\u201d. This section will appear at the end of the paper, after the discussion\/conclusions section and before the references, and will not count towards the page limit. Papers without a limitation section will be automatically rejected without review. ARR-reviewed paper that did not include \u201cLimitations\u201d section in their prior submission, should submit a PDF with such a section together with their EMNLP 2023 submission.

Fee Waiving Up to 3 instructors per tutorial can have their registration fees waived for the main conference and any subset of co-located tutorials and workshops. Diversity And Inclusion To foster a really inclusive culture in our field, we particularly encourage submissions from members of underrepresented groups in computational linguistics, i.e., researchers from any demographic or geographic minority, researchers with disabilities, among others. The overall diversity of the tutorial organizers and potential audience will be taken into account to ensure that the conference program is varied and balanced.  Tutorial proposals should describe and will be evaluated according to how the tutorial contributes to topics promoting diversity (e.g., working on minority languages, developing NLP for good), participation diversity (e.g., coordinating with social affinity groups, providing subsidies, making a promotional plan for the tutorial), and representation diversity among tutorial presenters. For more information or advice, organizers may consult resources such as the BIG directory, Black in AI, {Dis}ability in AI, Indigenous AI, LatinX in AI, Masakhane, 500 Queer Scientists, and Women-in-ML\u2019s directory.

Folkerts confirmed the three people killed in a midair collision were the only passengers onboard when the planes crashed. The names of the victims have not been released. However, Folkerts confirmed all three dead were pilots. The victims in the Cessna 172 were a flight instructor and student pilot, while the victim in the Sonex Xenos was the pilot.\u00a0 The Cessna departed from the Rocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport in Broomfield Saturday morning for a training flight. The Sonex aircraft departed from the Platte Valley Airpark in Fort Lupton.\u00a0 Neither aircraft was equipped with a collision-avoidance system. Folkerts said neither of the planes were required to install that system.\u00a0 A preliminary report of the collision will be released within two weeks of the incident. Final reports could take up to 18 months before they\u2019re released. The NTSB is looking for witnesses to assist in the investigation.","Jaccard Noise_40":1.0,"Cosine Noise_40":0.9984517097,"EM Noise_40":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":1,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"303-441-4763","Noise_60 Document Index":"10","Noise_60 Document":"Tracking data showed the two pilots flying the Cessna aircraft departed on a training flight from the Rocky Mountain Airport at 8:43 a.m. The pilot in the Sonex aircraft departed from the Platte Valley Airpark in Hudson at 8:38 a.m. During its flight, the Cessna made a 360-degree left turn and then a right turn to the east.

Now at 45 she has accepted the role of Italy's first female prime minister, although she has picked a government in which only one in four ministers are women. Meloni has come to power partly by fortune. Her Brothers of Italy party was one of very few that chose not to join Mario Draghi's national unity government and she became a solitary opposition voice. Although she has led her party for 10 years, her experience in government is limited to a spell as Italy's youngest minister in the Berlusconi government from 2008-11. Her party won the September 2022 elections with 26% of the vote, even though it had polled only 4.3% four years earlier. \"Italians have sent a clear message in favour of a right-wing government led by Brothers of Italy,\" she declared after her election win. With her partners from the far-right League and centre-right of ex-prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, she has a strong majority to steer through her programme. A clue to her priorities came in a typically raucous speech she gave in Spain last June. \"Yes to the natural family, no to the LGBT lobby, yes to sexual identity, no to gender ideology...","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.9999998808,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Giorgia Meloni","Noise_20 Document Index":"6","Noise_20 Document":"Giorgia Meloni (Italian:\u00a0[\u02c8d\u0292ord\u0292a me\u02c8lo\u02d0ni]; born 15 January 1977) is an Italian politician who has been serving as the prime minister of Italy since 22 October 2022, the first woman to hold this position.

In 1992, Meloni joined the Youth Front, the youth wing of the Italian Social Movement (MSI), a neo-fascist political party founded in 1946 by former followers of Italian fascism. She later became the national leader of Student Action, the student movement of the National Alliance (AN), a post-fascist party that became the MSI's legal successor in 1995 and moved towards national conservatism. She was a councillor of the Province of Rome from 1998 to 2002, after which she became the president of Youth Action, the youth wing of AN.

Aside from being the company behind many web services, Google has done quite well with its Pixel smartphones \u2014 with the latest being the Google Pixel 7 family. In 2022, Google also released its first smartwatch, the Google Pixel Watch, though it received mixed reviews overall. We\u2019re expecting Google to release a follow-up to the Pixel Watch sometime this year in the form of the Pixel Watch 2 and, hopefully, it will improve upon what was already established with the original. Though there haven\u2019t been a lot of leaked reports about the Pixel Watch 2, here\u2019s what we know so far about the upcoming smartwatch. The Google Pixel Watch launched with a unique aesthetic that was both modern and minimalistic. With that in mind, we should expect the Google Pixel Watch 2 to have the same kind of design, with a domed display, rotating digital crown, and unobtrusive band mechanisms. However, if Google could improve anything with the design here, it should start with thinner bezels on the round display. Durability should be around the same as the first Pixel Watch, and it\u2019s expected to run a version of Wear OS, possibly Wear OS 4. This would mean a clean, Google-focused user experience with customizable tiles, Fitbit integration, and third-party app support. Since the original Google Pixel Watch had Fitbit integration, that should continue with the Google Pixel Watch 2.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.4684274197,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said the publicly financed ceremony was a well-deserved honor for Japan\u2019s longest-serving modern political leader. The event was attended by U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, Japanese Crown Prince Akishino and other foreign and Japanese dignitaries.  Japan\u2019s main political opposition parties boycotted the funeral, which critics say was a reminder of how prewar imperialist governments used state funerals to fan nationalism. The government maintains that the ceremony was not meant to force anyone to honor Abe. But the decision to give him the rare honor \u2014 which was made without parliamentary debate or approval \u2014 as well as the funeral\u2019s high cost and other controversies have led to anger about the event. The funeral began with Abe\u2019s widow, Akie Abe, in a black formal kimono, walking slowly behind Kishida into the funeral venue, carrying an urn in a wooden box wrapped in a purple cloth with gold stripes. Soldiers in white uniforms took Abe\u2019s ashes and placed them on a pedestal filled with white and yellow chrysanthemums and decorations.","Jaccard Noise_60":0.0,"Cosine Noise_60":0.4757463336,"EM Noise_60":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_60":0,"Noise_80 Predicted Answer":"Tuesday","Noise_80 Document Index":"5","Noise_80 Document":"The rare and controversial state funeral for assassinated Abe began Tuesday in tense Japan where the event for one of the country\u2019s most divisive leaders has deeply split public opinion.

Max Verstappen secured his second World Championship title after finishing first, in front of Sergio P\u00e9rez and Charles Leclerc. Despite only 28 of the scheduled 53 laps being completed, full points were awarded due to a loophole in the regulations regarding how points should be allocated, with the rules stating that reduced points should only be awarded in shortened races that end under red flag conditions. As this race ended under green flag conditions, this system was not applied. The wording of the sporting regulations was subsequently amended for 2023, so races that do not reach the 75 percent distance are awarded shortened race points regardless of whether a race finishes under red or green flag conditions.  The event was held across the weekend of the 7\u20139 October. It was the eighteenth round of the 2022 Formula One World Championship and the first time the event had been held since 2019, with the 2020 and 2021 races cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The modern-day reboot will start leaping onto our screens this fall. Oh, boy! NBC showed off some initial footage from its upcoming reboot of Quantum Leap Monday, teasing an Earth-shattering debut for Dr. Ben Seong (Raymond Lee), a respected physicist who finds himself in the same predicament Scott Bakula's Dr. Samuel Beckett faced all those years ago. He's a man lost in the past, jumping from body to body in an effort to get back home. The pilot episode thrusts Dr. Seong back to 1989, where he must work to prevent a terrible tragedy from taking place amid the San Francisco Earthquake that occurred that same year. Funnily enough, 1989 is the same year the original iteration of the iconic series first leapt onto the small screen. It's a nice little homage to original creator\u00a0Don Bellisario and Deborah Platt (voice of the A.I. known as \"Ziggy\") \u2014 both of whom serve as executive producers on the modern-day revival. \"I really dug being in the \u201880s.

It made an overpriced GPU suddenly appear much more desirable than it ever should have been. Now, the question is, was this Nvidia\u2019s plan all along, or did it simply overestimate the enthusiasm people would have for the 4080? Considering the fact that Nvidia is planning to strategically cut the MSRP of the RTX 4080 soon, it might be that it never intended for the 4080 to serve as a crutch for the sales of the 4090. Nvidia also has some serious competition on the horizon. AMD will soon be launching the next-gen Radeon RX 7900 XTX and 7900 XT, both of which are supposed to rival the RTX 4080, but at more reasonable prices \u2014 $999 and $899, respectively. With the upcoming price cut, the RTX 4080 might become a more worthwhile contender. For now, if you manage to spot the 4090 for $1,600, it is a better deal \u2014 but only if you can make use of it. If you\u2019re a casual gamer, save your money and get the 4080 without worrying about benchmarks and comparisons.

Will the RTX 4060 become one of the best GPUs, or at least one of the most popular models in this generation? One might think that a GPU that costs over $40,000 is going to be the best graphics card for gaming, but the truth is a lot more complex than that. In fact, this Nvidia GPU can't even keep up with integrated graphics solutions. Now, before you get too upset, you should know I'm referring to Nvidia's H100, which houses the GH100 chip (Grace Hopper). It's a powerful data center GPU made to handle high-performance computing (HPC) tasks -- not power PC games. It doesn't have any display outputs, and despite its extensive capabilities, it also doesn't have any coolers. This is because, again, you'd find this GPU in a data center or server setting, where it'd be cooled with powerful external fans. Nvidia has just quietly announced the official release date of the RTX 4060. The GPU is coming out on June 29 and will be priced at $299.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.7848647237,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

Sunak, who is the U.K.\u2019s first leader of color, met King Charles III at Buckingham Palace, where the monarch officially asked the new leader of the governing Conservative Party to form a government, as is tradition.

{"Query":"which party controls the house after 2022 midterm elections?","Correct Answer":["Republican "],"Noise_0 Predicted Answer":"Democrats","Noise_0 Document Index":"5","Noise_0 Document":"A Republican House will likely clash on most issues with a Democratic Senate in 2023, with bitter fights over basic functions like funding the government threatening to paralyze Washington.    GOP candidates hoped to capitalize on voter frustration with the rising costs of groceries and gas, framing the election as a referendum on President Joe Biden and his party's rule of both the White House and Congress. But voters in exit polls indicated other issues like abortion rights and protecting democracy factored into their decisions at the ballot box. Redistricting in New York and Florida also helped the GOP overcome lackluster results in most of the races rated as toss-ups. The last time the president and top congressional leaders were from different parties was 2019, when Democrats regained control of the House in the 2018 midterms, two years after former President Donald Trump was elected president.  A new House Republican majority will mean Biden's legislative agenda is essentially dead, unless he can find bipartisan support for some narrowly crafted proposals. Biden's focus during the next two years of his presidency will likely be spent defending his signature accomplishments, like a bill lowering prescription drug prices and investing hundreds of billions of dollars to tackle climate change. GOP lawmakers have already said they want to roll back some of Biden's programs, or defund many of them.  The Biden White House will also face an onslaught of investigations on a wide range of issues.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.6566407681,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":0,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Democratic","Noise_20 Document Index":"0","Noise_20 Document":"Nov 12, 2022 ... \u201cElection Week\u201d is coming to a close with control of the House still up ... to the Democratic Party's tally, and four races to Republicans'.","Jaccard Noise_20":0.0,"Cosine Noise_20":0.6304568052,"EM Noise_20":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":0,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"Eisenhower and G.

Still, Republicans remained close to winning control of the U.S. House of Representatives as officials continued counting ballots cast in Tuesday's U.S. midterm elections. Cortez Masto narrowly defeated Republican challenger Adam Laxalt, a former state attorney general who was endorsed by former President Donald Trump. With Masto's victory on the heels of Democratic Senator Mark Kelly winning re-election in Arizona late on Friday, Democrats will control at least 50 Senate seats, with Vice President Kamala Harris able to break ties in the 100-member chamber. \"America showed that we believe in our democracy, that the roots of democracy are deep and strong,\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, told a news conference. The Senate is currently split 50-50 between Democrats and Republicans. The newly elected Senate will be sworn in on Jan. 3. Continued control of the Senate means Democrats will still be able to approve Biden's nominees such as federal judges.

It has been a while since the profilers' last on-screen case, but the characters' stories continued during that period. Granted that revival retcons the Criminal Minds finale in several ways, it's essentially the same thing. That being said, Paramount+ just cannot simply use the title Criminal Minds season 16 because the project is different in a couple of significant ways from its original run. That includes veering away from its episodic storytelling format to a more serialized one, not to mention being darker and more disturbing than CBS' iteration. By giving the Criminal Minds revival a new title, Paramount+ allows it to be both a reboot and a continuation of the CBS series. Calling it Criminal Minds season 16 could also be confusing if the project doesn\u2019t address every single plot line that the finale left loose, which puts a lot of burden on the new series. Having its official title of Criminal Minds: Evolution quickly establishes that the show is part of the Criminal Minds brand, which could entice some formers fans to check it out, especially those who haven\u2019t been keeping track of Paramount+\u2019s efforts to bring back the BAU on the small screen.

Asked if he thought he would need to spend $9 million per year on a football coach, Alberts said the salary scale is rising in the Big Ten and SEC because of dramatically increasing revenues tied to record-setting television rights deals. \"Let's be honest, there's a Power 2 now,\" Alberts said. \"Certainly not to denigrate any of the other conferences, but that's kind of where we're heading. ... If we're going to be serious about having Nebraska football competing at the upper level of the Big Ten Conference, there's going to be resources needed to acquire that talent.\" Rhule, who was 11-27 in two-plus seasons with the Panthers, was hired because of the success he had in his two college head-coaching jobs.

In doing so, they became the first Arab nation to advance to the last eight, ensuring a breakthrough for the region in the first global tournament in the Middle East, and also became the fourth African side to go this far in World Cup history. Their victory will be seen as not only a triumph for Morocco but vindication of the controversial FIFA decision to hand Qatar the hosting rights, adding significant gloss to another Arab success at the tournament like Saudi Arabia beating Argentina and Tunisia upsetting holders France in the group phase. Morocco, who edged Spain 3-0 in the shootout after a 0-0 draw at the end of two hours of energy-sapping action, now have a chance to become both the Arab world and Africa's first-ever semi-finalists if they continue to use the overwhelming support that has backed them through an impressive array of results.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":1.0,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Morocco","Noise_20 Document Index":"8","Noise_20 Document":"Dec 9, 2022 ...

Amid what he described as a listening tour of college sports stakeholders that already has been underway and will continue during his first 100 days, Baker did not dismiss out of hand the concept of college athletes becoming employees of their school. He also did not adhere to the idea that the association\u2019s only path to clarifying its most urgent underlying issues is the passage of new federal laws. Those notions have been articles of faith for Emmert and many other college sports leaders as Emmert\u2019s more-than-12-year run with the NCAA has been drawing to a close.

For years, I've been told that major college sports is headed toward another major division break, between the big boys in college football and the have-nots, and it's probably going to happen sooner rather than later. If the Power 5 conferences want to allow the NCAA to stage national basketball tournaments and championships in other sports, that's about the only way I can see a significantly relevant NCAA surviving. It has bungled just about everything else under Emmert's watch, from fighting an outdated amateurism model in the courts (and losing hundreds of millions in dollars in legal fees and plaintiffs' awards) to picking and choosing which schools to penalize for campus-wide sexual assault scandals to introducing a new enforcement process, the Independent Accountability Resolution Process, that added months, if not years, to the adjudication of significant infractions cases.

The inequities between the men and women were obvious and stark, which put the NCAA into damage-control mode. At that point, those in the women's basketball world had to question if Emmert was very sincere in his concern, but there was a \"better-late-than-never\" sentiment. And the NCAA's decision to commission the so-called Kaplan report, which did a deep dive into inequities in all men's and women's NCAA championships, was an important step because it didn't pull any punches about how significant those issues have been. The report also said the NCAA has been selling women's sports short regarding potential television revenue. When it's time to negotiate TV rights again, rather than selling multiple championships in a bargain bundle, the NCAA needs to think bigger about the worth of each championship and how best to maximize revenue from it. Also, the NCAA has to show more leadership regarding the inclusion of transgender athletes in competition. As with so many things, the NCAA has been behind on this. Dave Wilson: The next leader is going to have to get creative to figure out the mess of issues currently embroiling college sports, or finally just step out of the way and put on tournaments.

The company has also faced criticism for its handling of the situation and the toxic work environment that allegedly exists within the company.

Alegre\u2019s departure from Activision to Yuga Labs may be seen as a positive move for those who are critical of Activision\u2019s leadership and culture. It\u2019s worth noting that the gaming industry and the NFT space have both been the subject of intense scrutiny and controversy in recent years. The allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination at Activision Blizzard have been a particularly significant source of controversy in the gaming industry. Meanwhile, the NFT space has faced criticism for its environmental impact and the high levels of speculation and price volatility surrounding some NFTs. Furthermore, the recent fake news surrounding Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) highlights the need for responsible and informed reporting in the NFT space. Given these issues, the appointment of Alegre as Yuga Labs\u2019 CEO marks an interesting new phase for the company.

Fury of the Gods\u201d arrives with two strikes against it since it\u2019s not only a studio-produced sequel but also a superhero movie made in 2023. One should expect a certain level of creative committee-mandated, Mad Libs-y monotony, regardless of how one feels about the surprisingly decent \u201cShazam!\u201d.

Fury of the Gods\u201d meanders further in that direction. The first \u201cShazam!\u201d works as well as it does because it\u2019s mostly focused on two adolescent pipsqueaks, Billy Batson (Asher Angel) and Freddy Freeman (Jack Dylan Grazer), who get sucked into a generic fantasy, with some assistance from their extended family of orphan buddies. \u201cShazam! Fury of the Gods\u201d mostly sticks to the comic book formula that the first movie poked fun at, despite another strong comedic performance from star Zachary Levi and some sporadic yuks throughout.

The character wears his comic book character's signature red outfit with a white cape and lightning bolt on his chest. Shazam, originally named Captain Marvel, was at one point the most popular superhero in the world and even outsold Superman comics. The character has the potential to be a major part of the DCU; if the sequel does well, there's little doubt he can fit him into James Gunn and Peter Safran's new plans for the franchise. Freddy Freeman is Billy's physically disabled foster brother and also the first person to learn that Billy has superpowers. Freddy is an expert on all things superheroes and helps Billy learn more about his powers. Freddy Freeman's adult form, formerly known as Captain Marvel Jr. in the comics, wears a blue super suit and has a great deal of flight power, which is fitting because that was the superpower he told Billy he wished he could have. One of the most courageous members of the group (representing Achilles), his kid form is played by Jack Dylan Grazer, while his adult form is played by Adam Brody.

Under his helm, TikTok reached 150 million users in the U.S., the majority of them teens and young adults who are attracted to the app\u2019s simple interface and addictive algorithm that serves up short videos on just about any imaginable topic.

On Monday, Twitch gave the channel a 14-day ban after language model tools from OpenAI went haywire and generated transphobic content that violated community guidelines. Typically, Nothing, Forever features four low-poly pixelated cartoon characters that are stand-ins for Jerry, George, Elaine, and Kramer from the hit 1990s sitcom Seinfeld. They sit around a New York apartment and talk about life, and sometimes the topics of conversation unexpectedly get deep, such as in this viewer-captured segment where they discussed the afterlife. Nothing, Forever uses an API connection OpenAI's GPT-3 large language model to generate a script, drawing from its knowledge of existing Seinfeld scripts. Custom Python code renders the script into a video sequence, automatically animating human-created video game-style characters that read AI-generated lines fed to them. One of its creators provided more technical details on how it works in a Reddit comment from December. As a new media experiment, the faux-Seinfeld stream often feels awkward and unfunny, but it's still interesting because viewers never know what the characters will talk about next.","Jaccard Noise_40":1.0,"Cosine Noise_40":1.0,"EM Noise_40":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":1,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"NOTHING, FOREVER","Noise_60 Document Index":"5","Noise_60 Document":"Feb 4, 2023 ...

Why trust us? These days, Google is all-in on AI, and Google Bard is its flagship product. It\u2019s an AI chatbot, and it\u2019s very much meant to be a rival to the ever-popular ChatGPT. And while it does replicate a lot of what ChatGPT does, Google has become highly invested in this space and has already made some significant updates to the tool that take it beyond what ChatGPT can do. Like ChatGPT, Google Bard is a conversational AI chatbot that can generate text of all kinds. You can ask it any question, as long as it doesn\u2019t violate its content policies, Bard will provide an answer. Although Bard hasn\u2019t officially replaced Google Assistant, it\u2019s a far more powerful AI assistant. That\u2019s because it\u2019s based on Google\u2019s own LLM (Large Language Model), known as LaMDA (Language Model for Dialogue Applications). Like OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3.5, the model behind ChatGPT, the engineers at Google have trained LaMDA on hundreds of billions of parameters, letting the AI \u201clearn\u201d natural language on its own. The result is a chatbot that can answer any question in surprisingly natural and conversational language. LaMDA was originally announced at Google I\/O in 2021, but it remained a prototype and was never released to the public.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":1.0,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Bard","Noise_20 Document Index":"5","Noise_20 Document":"Google set a high bar for its new artificial intelligence chatbot Bard.

It\u2019s not a replacement for Google search. It\u2019s not even a replacement for Assistant, Google\u2019s other AI bot, which also answers questions and operates Android phones and smart speakers. And in conversation, Bard can come across as staid \u2014 even though it still sometimes struggles with making up facts, bias and sticking to appropriate content like rival chatbots. Oh boy, can it be painfully unfunny. Bard, tell me a joke about Washington and it replies:  \u201cWhat do you call a Washington, D.C. resident who\u2019s always late? A Washing-ton.

Microsoft announced a new version of its search engine Bing is integrating artificial intelligence chat in a step the tech giant hopes will bolster its place in the online search business (Feb. 7) (AP Video: Manuel Valdes) REDMOND, Wash. (AP) \u2014 Microsoft is fusing ChatGPT-like technology into its search engine Bing, transforming an internet service that now trails far behind Google into a new way of communicating with artificial intelligence. The revamping of Microsoft\u2019s second-place search engine could give the software giant a head start against other tech companies in capitalizing on the worldwide excitement surrounding ChatGPT, a tool that\u2019s awakened millions of people to the possibilities of the latest AI technology.  Along with adding it to Bing, Microsoft is also integrating the chatbot technology into its Edge browser. Microsoft announced the new technology at an event Tuesday at its headquarters in Redmond, Washington. \u201cThink of it as faster, more accurate, more powerful\u201d than ChatGPT, built with technology from ChatGPT-maker OpenAI but tuned for search queries, said Yusuf Mehdi, a Microsoft executive who leads its consumer division, in an interview.

Microsoft is teaming up with OpenAI, the San Francisco research lab behind ChatGPT, to revamp Bing so that it can handle more complicated queries alongside providing factual information. \"It's a new day for search,\" said Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella in an announcement made at the company's headquarters on Tuesday. \"In fact, a race starts today in terms of what you can expect.\"  Microsoft's announcement that it is doubling down on what is considered the hottest new technology is a direct challenge to Google, the dominant player in online search for decades. Google controls about 90% of the online search market. Microsoft executive Yusuf Mehdi provided a demonstration of the retooled Bing at a briefing with reporters.

That's the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. And it announced yesterday it will cut another 10,000 jobs. This follows 11,000 layoffs at Meta last November. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said that 2023 will be Meta's, quote, \"year of efficiency.\" He also says it will be, in his words, stronger and more nimble. We're joined now by Wall Street Journal technology reporter Sam Schechner. Sam, thanks for coming on. SAM SCHECHNER: A pleasure to be here. PFEIFFER: These are a lot of layoffs, but I want to make sure we put it in the overall context of how large Meta is. So tell us, how many employees does it have now? How many will it have left once the layoffs are done? SCHECHNER: Well, those are good questions. We know the numerator. We don't necessarily know the denominator. At the end of the year, Meta had roughly 86,000 employees. Most of those who are being laid off - the 11,000 from last fall - were still on the payroll, the company said.","Jaccard Noise_40":1.0,"Cosine Noise_40":0.9999999404,"EM Noise_40":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":1,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"10000","Noise_60 Document Index":"7","Noise_60 Document":"Mar 14, 2023 ...

The new round of layoffs follows a previous round of cuts, announced in November, that affected more than 11,000 workers, which equated to roughly 13% of Meta's overall staff. Zuckerberg has pitched 2023 as the company's \"year of efficiency,\" in which the firm aims to\u00a0become \"a stronger and more nimble organization.\" \"We are a technology company, and our ultimate output is what we build for people,\" Zuckerberg said. As part of the restructuring, the company will also increase the number of direct reports each manager has. Zuckerberg told analysts in February that Meta plans \"on cutting projects that aren't performing or may no longer be crucial\" while simultaneously \"removing layers of middle management to make decisions faster.\" \"A leaner org will execute its highest priorities faster,\" Zuckerberg's message said. Still, Meta continues to spend billions of dollars developing the virtual reality and augmented reality technologies required to build the digital universe coined the metaverse.

While there are clear data privacy concerns stemming from the Amazon iRobot acquisition, proving an anticompetitive argument could be trickier, Ray said. If a company like Shark --which also makes robot vacuums -- acquired iRobot, he believes that's a definitive competition concern. Amazon, however, isn't a market leader in vacuum robots, making it difficult to pinpoint the competition argument, he said. \"Obviously it makes iRobot a very serious competitor, and if I was making robot vacuum cleaners, I would be nervous,\" Ray said. \"But that's not enough to trigger a competition investigation.\" Ray said that subscription revenues are becoming increasingly important for companies needing long-term commitment and revenue, and Amazon could turn its iRobot acquisition into a subscription service. \"You could imagine paying for a Roomba on a subscription whereby spare parts are automatically sent to you, new brushes are automatically sent to you, and indeed the product itself would be cheap to make up for that,\" Ray said. \"So I think they see that as going towards a subscription service.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.1169645861,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":0,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Amazon","Noise_20 Document Index":"7","Noise_20 Document":"Aug 5, 2022 ...

Llamas are used to carry supplies to LeConte Lodge Photo: Getty Images  When you stay at LeConte Lodge in Great Smoky Mountains National Park, you have to work a little bit to get there. Located at 6,360 feet, LeConte Lodge can be reached by guests on foot on six hiking trails. But how does the lodge get its supplies? The answer is llamas. These sure-footed creatures play a key role in getting food and other supplies to the remote lodge.  \u00a0 How does the lodge get its food when there are no roads to the high-altitude perch? A train of llamas has been carrying food, linens and other supplies up the lodge three times a week along the Trillium Gap Trail since 1986. Prior to the llamas, horses carried the loads, but they made a relatively big impact on the narrow, rocky trail. Llamas small hooves have a lighter impact on the trail. Before starting their 6.7-mile climb to the lodge, the llamas eat alfalfa cubes. Led by a llama wrangler, the llamas spend about four hours on trail to reach the lodge.","Jaccard Noise_80":0.0,"Cosine Noise_80":0.2554844618,"EM Noise_80":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":0,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"LoRA","Noise_100 Document Index":"4","Noise_100 Document":"lora_dropout = 0.05  config = LLaMAConfig.from_name(\"7B\")  config.block_size = block_size  # initlize model with LoRA  with lora(r=lora_r, alpha=lora_alpha, dropout=lora_dropout, enabled=True):  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 model = LLaMA(config)  # mark only LoRA injected layers for training  mark_only_lora_as_trainable(model)   config = LLaMAConfig.from_name(\"7B\")  config.block_size = block_size  # initlize model with LoRA  with lora(r=lora_r, alpha=lora_alpha, dropout=lora_dropout, enabled=True):  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 model = LLaMA(config)  # mark only LoRA injected layers for training  mark_only_lora_as_trainable(model)   config.block_size = block_size  # initlize model with LoRA  with lora(r=lora_r, alpha=lora_alpha, dropout=lora_dropout, enabled=True):  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 model = LLaMA(config)  # mark only LoRA injected layers for training  mark_only_lora_as_trainable(model)   # initlize model with LoRA  with lora(r=lora_r, alpha=lora_alpha, dropout=lora_dropout, enabled=True):  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 model = LLaMA(config)  # mark only LoRA injected layers for training  mark_only_lora_as_trainable(model)","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.7293873429,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

This is my favorite fact now.\u00a0 Hasbro is now a big company, and it makes everything from Transformers and Lincoln Logs to My Little Pony and Monopoly. It also makes Magic: The Gathering and Dungeons & Dragons, which are massive and growing businesses. Chris was actually the head of that division, called Wizards of the Coast, before he became the CEO of Hasbro overall last year. Since then, he\u2019s started the process of restructuring the company, which is pure Decoder bait.\u00a0 He\u2019s also dealt with some crises: he\u2019s fended off an activist investor that wanted him to spin off Wizards of the Coast into a new company. The Magic community was upset that too many card sets were being released, including rare collector cards that could suddenly be bought by anybody with enough money. Then, an attempt to change the open gaming license for Dungeons & Dragons led to fan backlash, and Hasbro walked the entire plan back.","Jaccard Noise_40":1.0,"Cosine Noise_40":1.0,"EM Noise_40":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":1,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"Chris Cocks","Noise_60 Document Index":"7","Noise_60 Document":"Jan 5, 2022 ...

She already won an Olivier a couple of months ago for her work in the West End production. She would be the fifth Tony winner in this category for a one-woman performance. In Suzie Miller\u2018s one-woman show, Comer plays Tessa, a barrister from working-class origins who must deal with an unexpected event that forces her to confront the patriarchal power and morality of the law.            When it comes to solo performances at the Tonys, four have prevailed in this category before.

She said, \"I met Taylor Swift very briefly once at an awards, and she very kindly came up to me and introduced herself and she said, 'I loved \"Doctor Foster\"; and I was like, wow, of all the things, it's 'Doctor Foster'? So, you never quite know what it's gonna be for people.\" For most people, it's the BBC series \"Killing Eve.\" For four seasons, Comer played Villanelle, a psychopathic Russian assassin obsessed with a British MI6 agent (played by Canadian actress Sandra Oh).  Comer's convincing performance in \"Killing Eve,\" which won her a best actress Emmy in 2019, almost cost her the part in \"Prima Facie.\" Playwright Suzie Miller said she was at first hesitant to pick Comer for the role. \"When her name was bought up, I said, 'Oh, no, no.

Everyone who considered it outrageous that Huckabee Sanders could be insulted in such a high-profile setting needs to be reminded that she\u2019s now the governor of Arkansas, where so far she\u2019s banned the use of the word \u201cLatinx,\u201d rolled back child labor laws, and recently endorsed koozies lauding the election of \u201creal women,\u201d a blatant attempt to debase the trans community while trolling Bud Light.

Google officially unveiled the Pixel Fold at Google I\/O on March 10, 2023.\u00a0It comes in two colors \u2014 Obsidian and Porcelain. You can also choose between three official Pixel Fold cases that come in Hazel, Porcelain, and Bay colors (pictured above). Google is charging a similar price to the rival Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4. The 256GB variant of the Pixel Fold will cost you a whopping $1,799. The 512GB version is even more expensive at $1,919, which seems costly for Google\u2019s first attempt at a foldable phone. Google hopes you buy the foldable Pixel for its thin form factor, \u201ctrue pocket size,\u201d loaded camera features, \u201call-day battery,\u201d multi-tasking skills, and long-lasting software support. However, we\u2019ll only know if it justifies that price when we review the device. As for availability, Google is not casting a very wide net for the Pixel Fold.

With the device unfolded, I ran two apps side by side, which was useful for reading a webpage while typing an email. Google also demonstrated how its translation app could take advantage of the two screens. Consider a situation in which you, an English speaker, are trying to communicate with someone who speaks Chinese. Holding the phone unfolded, you can speak English into the microphone and have the phone\u2019s outer screen show text translated into Chinese to the other person. When the Chinese speaker responds, you can read the translated text on the inner screen. This feature will not be released until the fall, so I didn\u2019t get to test it. But it\u2019s an intriguing use case. In the end, the device is expensive because it is packed with advanced technology with no major trade-offs. In my tests, its camera produced crisp and vibrant images on a par with photos taken with Apple\u2019s latest iPhone and the Pixel 7 Pro, Google\u2019s $900 smartphone, which has an excellent camera. Though the Pixel Fold\u2019s high price will make it inaccessible to most people, it was an exciting glimpse into the next step for smartphones. Over the last five years, as phone screens got bigger, we have voted with our wallets and shown that we prefer larger screens, so long as they come on devices easy to carry everywhere.

The updates, announced at its annual Google I\/O developer conference, come as the company is simultaneously trying to push beyond its core advertising business with new devices while also racing to defend its search engine from the threat posed by a wave of new AI-powered tools.

The US labor market is on a smooth trajectory, but turmoil in the financial market could cause turbulence. This labor market continues to work for workers. Unemployment is very low, but the continued progress in enticing people into the workforce is perhaps more encouraging. The labor force participation rate for workers ages 25 to 54 hit a level previously seen in March 2008, and the last time the employment rate for these workers was this high was May 2001. The number of workers who were unemployed because they had recently lost a job dropped in April, reversing a concerning rise seen in recent months.

And these intuitive controls are meant to feel natural as well. Apple says all it takes is turning your head to shift the focus of the display, or a simple tap of your fingers to simulate a mouse click. You can even keep your hands in a natural position rather than holding them in front of you when making gestures. Glancing at a search bar and speaking will even allow you to type into the search bar for easy use. Aside from these new methods of controlling the mixed reality headset, there are two familiar features. First, Siri is back, giving you Apple's famous voice assistant right out of the box. Second, the headset does work with a range of Bluetooth products. In addition to supporting controllers like the PS5 DualSense, it also supports the Apple Magic Keyboard, Mouse and Trackpad in case you don't want to rely on hand gestures or a virtual keyboard.

It gives you greater appreciation for being a champion.\" Mahomes acknowledged that there was a huge difference between his reaction to winning this title and his first championship, a victory over San Francisco in Super Bowl LIV. Mahomes compared that first accomplishment to a wide-eyed kid taking home a prize from the fair. There was a whirlwind of success, accompanied by an offseason of celebrating and an attempt at a repeat that ended with that blowout loss to Tampa Bay in Super Bowl LV.

Mahomes grew from all those moments in ways that weren't that visible when this regular season began. There was so much attention paid to the trade that sent Hill to Miami and all the blockbuster personnel moves made by the rest of the AFC West that it seemed as if the Chiefs were more vulnerable than ever.
