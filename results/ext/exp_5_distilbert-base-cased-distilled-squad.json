Although Tesla\u2019s stock has dropped from its all-time high of $1229.91 reached on November 04, 2021, it is still high. As of writing, Tesla is trading at $890.00. Considering that in 2011, TSLA shares cost a mere $4.92, the company has done exceptionally well since its inception.

What microchip shortage? EV maker Tesla, which it should be pointed out produces its own chips in-house, seems not to have been bothered by supply-chain issues all that much in 2021, delivering 936,172 vehicles in the year just ended, according to a report by finance news outlet Finbold. That represents a healthy 87 percent increase over 2020, when the company handed over 499,550 Teslas to customers. Even better for the company, it ended the year with a bang, racking up a record number of sales in the last quarter of 2021, or 308,600 units. Most of that total consisted of Model 3 and Model Y models, no surprise. It\u2019s the sixth consecutive quarter that it breaks its record for sales. In 2019, the automaker delivered 367,500 units, so annual sales growth, while not exponential, is clearly accelerating. The company has said in the past that one its main goals is to attain 50 percent sales growth year after year. Once upon a time, Tesla struggled mightily to hit its delivery targets, but no more. There\u2019s also no sign of that growth slowing down any time soon, even as all-electric rivals join the market by the month.

Despite lower car prices, the company managed to mitigate the already-expected decline in margins, showcasing Elon Musk\u2019s adeptness at steering the company through both prosperous and challenging times. Another noteworthy aspect is the positive evolution of Tesla\u2019s revenue mix, which bodes well for H2 \u2013 when we expect further margin contraction in the car sales department. With improvements in revenue from Energy and Services, Tesla gains greater flexibility to continue its strategy of offering competitive prices and driving more sales. While it\u2019s true that Tesla\u2019s recent rally may have been excessive in the short term, the overall trajectory of the company remains positive. Thus, investors should exercise caution before betting against Tesla, as it continues to exceed expectations and enhance its long-term prospects.\u201d While other automakers delivered their worst sales figures in a decade, Tesla\u2019s delivery statistics were praiseworthy in 2022. The company delivered 1,313,851 vehicles to customers worldwide and, in so doing, increased its deliveries by 40% in comparison to the previous year. It also produced 47% more cars in 2022 compared to 2021.

Tom Cruise subsequently gave back his Globes, NBC opted not to air the ceremony last year, and reform in the form of inclusivity began to take shape. After Jerrod Carmichael explained to the audience at the Beverly Hilton how he wound up as the host (spoiler: \"I'm here because I'm Black,\" he quipped before launching into a detailed and honest account of his decision-making process), the trophy distribution began. The Banshees of Inisherin, which led all movies with eight nominations, struck up a meaningful friendship with Globes voters over the evening: The Irish-island-set tragicomedy took home the best comedy film trophy, while Colin Farrell triumphed in the acting category and writer-director Martin McDonagh won for best screenplay. The Fablemans also came into frame by winning best drama film honors and best director (Steven Spielberg).

Overseen by Bavor, the headset was to be powered by the Android operating system as well as a custom system on a chip akin to Tensor, expected to launch in 2024 alongside Project Starline. Other key people named as part of the project include Shahram Izadi, Eddie Chung, Scott Huffman, Kurt Akeley, and Lucovsky.[13] An early prototype of the headset bore a close resemblance to the North Focals.[14] In March, The Information reported that Google would acquire Raxium, an AR hardware startup, for approximately $1 billion, and would continue to make further acquisitions to assist in their AR and mixed reality (MR) work.[15] The acquisition was completed a month later.[16]  In May 2022, Google unveiled a different version of Iris resembling eyeglasses with live translation capabilities during the 2022 Google I\/O keynote.[14][17][18] The company began publicly testing these prototypes across the U.S. in August,[19] before expanding into Canada in October.[20] According to Business Insider, Google executives' constantly changing strategy for Project Iris frustrated employees.","Jaccard Noise_60":1.0,"Cosine Noise_60":1.0,"EM Noise_60":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_60":1,"Noise_80 Predicted Answer":"Project Iris","Noise_80 Document Index":"0","Noise_80 Document":"If you\u2019ve ever wanted to Google search with your eyes, we\u2019ve got great news.

Then, in 2003, Carolyn Bertozzi proposed that click chemistry could be used in studies of biological systems to make it easier to observe vital cellular processes without interfering with them. Bertozzi called this \u201cbioorthogonal\u201d chemistry in a paper\u00a0she and her colleagues published that year. The term has since been\u00a0widely-adopted term in the field. The ability to perform complex reactions in living systems without interfering with natural biological reactions made it possible to study molecules and cellular processes in cells and inside complex organisms such as zebra fish, rather than in laboratory dishes. It has already helped scientists understand an important protein processing reaction called glycosylation, helped to develop molecular imaging molecules that could detect disease in living organisms, and opened up the possibility of selectively delivering drugs to particular tissues in the body. These findings have \u201cled to a revolution in how chemists think about linking molecules together and how to do it in living cells,\u201d \u00c5qvist said.

It was more special because of all the doubters who hovered around the Chiefs when this season began, the same skeptics who pointed to all the new faces on this roster and the departure of All-Pro wide receiver Tyreek Hill as reasons for Kansas City's likely demise. This title wasn't just about the brilliance of Mahomes; it was about the way this team followed his lead. The Chiefs won their second championship in four years with their 38-35 win over the Eagles in Super Bowl LVII. It's now time to talk about a dynasty, repeat potential and all the fun things that come with sustained success. Just as importantly, it's worth discussing how much Mahomes accomplished with a team that was supposed to be resetting itself this year. He wound up winning everything a player can win in a single season -- including league MVP and Super Bowl MVP -- and he delivered this latest championship while playing with a high ankle sprain against the league's best pass rush.

In 2019, the journey culminated in the release of Avengers: Endgame, which premiered to critical and commercial success. It had gone from a story about a playboy billionaire (Tony Stark\/Iron Man) to a larger story than spanned universes as well as heroes and villains alike. Although, as the universe expanded, it was hard to ignore that Marvel\u2019s roster of superheroes still lacked diversity. This was made even more apparent when other superhero stories started to make their way into the mainstream.\u00a0 In the same year that Endgame came out, a quiet and subversive TV show was making waves. The Boys is adapted from a graphic novel of the same name, one that is notorious amongst fans and haters alike for its crude, graphic and violent nature. The series considers what would happen if superheroes existed in the real world. The short answer is that they would become an untouchable commodity that could wreak havoc, which would be cleaned up by their slick and all-powerful parent company Vought. The series touches on power, social media, politics and causes the line between hero and villain to become truly blurred.\u00a0 It is difficult not to draw comparisons between the storylines in The Boys and the reality of the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe).","Jaccard Noise_80":0.0,"Cosine Noise_80":0.331620574,"EM Noise_80":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":0,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"Marvel's record-smashing epic","Noise_100 Document Index":"0","Noise_100 Document":"Did you expect 'Avengers: Endgame' to get so dark?

Russia's President Vladimir Putin has given varying public explanations for why he launched the invasion. Here are the reasons Putin gave, how they match with reality, and the other likely reasons why Russia sent its armed forces into an independent, sovereign nation. Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union, before declaring itself an independent country, cementing the move in a referendum days before the USSR collapsed in December 1991. The country has maintained its independence ever since. But Putin still refers to Ukraine as Russian, and denies it's a nation in its own right. He told then-US President George W. Bush in 2008 that Ukraine wasn't even a country. Stephen Hall, a Russian politics expert at the University of Bath in the UK, said many Russians still hold this view, and that \"it isn't just the Kremlin.\" Hall said Russia sees Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, as the \"mother of Russian cities,\" and for Putin he can't have that being outside his own country. Hall added that Russia needs to claim Ukraine in order to back up its argument to being a great power that has existed for millennia. Without it \"Russia can't claim a thousand years of history because Kyiv was already in existence 1,200 years ago, when Moscow was a forest,\" he said.","Jaccard Noise_40":0.6666666667,"Cosine Noise_40":0.8160431981,"EM Noise_40":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":1,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"February 2022","Noise_60 Document Index":"9","Noise_60 Document":"\"Nazism is Russia-phobia to them. So the Ukrainians are Nazis because they're anti-Russian.\" Putin also promotes this Nazi idea to win support in the West, where people have always been \"susceptible\" to the argument that Ukraine has a Nazi problem, Hall said. He said Putin's strategy is partly \"throw things at the wall and see what sticks.\" According to Graham, there is no evidence that Putin was under public pressure to invade Ukraine, which suggests at least some of his reasoning was personal. All three experts said Putin's desire to be revered in history books likely motivated him to attack. Hall said Putin's anxiety is around \"am I going to be a footnote in Russian history or are they going to write books about me like they do Peter the Great, Catherine the Great, Stalin.\" Taylor agrees, saying that Putin sees himself as \"a great historic Russian leader restoring Russian lands, and he was thinking about his legacy as he turned 70.\" \"What have the great Czars done? They've expanded Russian territory,\" Graham said. Even with all of the above, why the invasion happened when it did is an intriguing question. Experts pointed to multiple reasons why Russia invaded in February 2022. One was the arrival of Zelenskyy, who came to power in 2019 after a career as a comedian and actor. Putin believed that in Zelenskyy \"he had someone he could manipulate in Ukraine,\" Hall said.","Jaccard Noise_60":0.3333333333,"Cosine Noise_60":0.7539719343,"EM Noise_60":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_60":0,"Noise_80 Predicted Answer":"one-year anniversary","Noise_80 Document Index":"7","Noise_80 Document":"The factors cited by experts, such as the independent Institute for the Study of War, include Russia\u2019s training and mobilization of hundreds of thousands of troops and the acceleration of the pace of Moscow\u2019s operations in western Luhansk, one of the territories that compose the Donbas region that Russia first invaded in 2014.

It was directed by Hidetaka Miyazaki with worldbuilding provided by fantasy writer George R. R. Martin. It was released for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X\/S on February 25 by FromSoftware in Japan and Bandai Namco Entertainment internationally. Players control a customizable player character who is on a quest to repair the Elden Ring and become the new Elden Lord.  Elden Ring is presented through a third-person perspective; players freely roam its interactive open world. The six main areas are traversed using the player character's steed Torrent as the primary mode of travel. Linear, hidden dungeons can be explored to find useful items. Players can use several types of weapons and magic spells, including non-direct engagement enabled by stealth mechanics. Throughout the game's world, checkpoints enable fast travel and allow players to improve their attributes using an in-game currency called Runes. Elden Ring has an online multiplayer mode in which players can join each other for cooperative and player-versus-player combat.  During planning, FromSoftware wanted to create an open-world game with gameplay similar to Dark Souls; the company wanted Elden Ring to act as an evolution of the self-titled debut of the series. Miyazaki admired the work of Martin, whose contributions he hoped would produce a more accessible narrative than those of the company's earlier games.","Jaccard Noise_40":1.0,"Cosine Noise_40":0.9999999404,"EM Noise_40":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":1,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"February 25, 2022","Noise_60 Document Index":"3","Noise_60 Document":"Feb 13, 2022 ...

{"Query":"What happened at the Academy Awards involving Will Smith and Chris Rock?","Correct Answer":["slapped"],"Noise_0 Predicted Answer":"slapped comedian Chris Rock across the face","Noise_0 Document Index":"7","Noise_0 Document":"During the 94th Academy Awards on March 27, 2022, actor Will Smith walked onstage and slapped comedian Chris Rock across the face during Rock's presentation for Best Documentary Feature. The slap was in response to Rock's joke about Smith's wife Jada Pinkett Smith's shaved head, which she had been shaving since 2021 due to alopecia areata. Smith returned to his seat and shouted profanity at Rock, who briefly responded, but completed his presentation without further interruption.  Later that evening, Smith won Best Actor and apologized to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and other nominees, but not to Rock, in his acceptance speech. The next day, he issued an apology to Rock and the Academy through social media. Smith resigned his Academy membership on April 1, facing a potential suspension or expulsion, and was banned from attending Academy events for 10 years, effective April 8.  Live television broadcasts in the United States mostly muted the incident due to federal censorship laws. However, uncensored international footage went viral on social media; an excerpt from the Australian broadcast became one of the most-viewed online videos in the first 24 hours. The incident received worldwide attention and largely overshadowed the rest of the ceremony.  After the ceremony, some publications recalled Rock's past remarks about Jada Pinkett Smith. In 1997, he had commented on her participation in the Million Woman March in an interview on his late night-talk show, The Chris Rock Show.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.1666666667,"Cosine Noise_0":0.4331899583,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"slapped comedian Chris Rock across the face","Noise_20 Document Index":"4","Noise_20 Document":"During the 94th Academy Awards on March 27, 2022, actor Will Smith walked onstage and slapped comedian Chris Rock across the face during Rock's presentation\u00a0...","Jaccard Noise_20":0.1666666667,"Cosine Noise_20":0.4331899583,"EM Noise_20":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":1,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"the Academy initiated disciplinary proceedings","Noise_40 Document Index":"7","Noise_40 Document":"On July 29, 2022, Smith posted a YouTube video in which he addressed the incident and apologized to Rock, Rock's mother, Rock's brother Tony, Questlove, the other Oscar winners, and his wife Jada saying he was \"deeply remorseful\" for his actions.[50]  On March 28, the day after the incident, AMPAS announced a formal review.[51] The Academy's Board of Governors intended to explore further action and consequences in accordance with its Bylaws, its Standards of Conduct, and with California law, scheduled for March 30.[52][53] AMPAS President David Rubin and CEO Dawn Hudson issued a subsequent letter to Academy members, noting that the official process would take a few weeks.[54][55] On March 29, Smith initiated a six-minute Zoom call with Rubin and Hudson, apologizing again for his actions.

The M2 chip is built upon the new second-generation 5nm architecture, with Apple claiming it offers an 18% CPU performance increase on the existing M1 processor.  But just because this is Apple\u2019s latest chip for Macs, it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the most powerful. Just like the M1 chip, the M2 is designed for entry-level devices such as the  MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro.

The unveiling would happen at a second Apple event in October, following the release of the iPhone 15 in September.  Apple introduced new pricing for iMac in 2021, with the entry-level model costing $1,299. If Apple was to keep on an M1 iMac it could sell an iMac for less than $1,000.

Twitter invited Musk to join its board of directors, an offer he initially accepted before declining. On April 14, Musk made an unsolicited offer to purchase the company, to which Twitter's board initially responded with a \"poison pill\" strategy to resist a hostile takeover, before unanimously accepting Musk's buyout offer of $44\u00a0billion on April 25. Musk stated that he planned to introduce new features to the platform, make its algorithms open-source, combat spambot accounts, and promote free speech.  In July, Musk announced his intention to terminate the agreement, asserting that Twitter had breached their agreement by refusing to crack down on spambot accounts. The company filed a lawsuit against Musk in the Delaware Court of Chancery shortly thereafter, with a trial scheduled for the week of October 17. Weeks before the trial was set to begin, Musk reversed course, announcing that he would move forward with the acquisition. The deal was closed on October 27, with Musk immediately becoming Twitter's new owner and CEO.

By Bill Pennington AUGUSTA, Ga. \u2014 It would have been understandable if Scottie Scheffler, who has been the paragon of poise as he charged to the No. 1 ranking in men\u2019s golf this year, felt just a bit unnerved during the first hour of Sunday\u2019s final round of the Masters Tournament. The three-stroke lead he held over his closest pursuer, Cameron Smith, when the day began had shrunk to a single stroke in the opening two holes. Worse for Scheffler, on the par-4 third hole, he yanked his tee shot into the trees then failed to get a pitch onto the elevated green, with his ball trundling backward into a dicey spot below the putting surface. Would it take only three holes for Smith to catch Scheffler? Was the typically tranquil Scheffler, with his everyman nonchalance, about to wilt under the pressure? Anyone who has been paying attention to this year\u2019s PGA Tour, a circuit Scheffler has dominated since February, might have been able to predict what happened next.

Even a surprising double bogey by Scheffler on the final hole (with the tournament already all but won) couldn't spoil the 25-year-old's first career Masters victory. Said Scheffler of his \"hiccup\": \"I\u2019m really at a loss for words right now.

Scottie Scheffler dominated the final three rounds of the 2022 Masters en route to a green jacket, record $2.7 million payout and further enshrinement as the hottest golfer on the planet, carding a 10-under 278 to win his first career major on Sunday.  Scheffler became the fifth golfer to enter Augusta National ranked No. 1 in the world and go on to win the Masters, joining Ian Woosnam (1991), Fred Couples (1992), Tiger Woods (2001-02) and Dustin Johnson (2020).  The victory was his fourth on the PGA Tour this season, making him the first golfer since Arnold Palmer in 1960 -- and only the second ever -- to win as many events including the Masters in that span of time to begin a season, according to Justin Ray.  Scheffler is on such a heater that he actually won all four of those PGA Tour events in just a 57-day span, marking the shortest stretch from a first to fourth victory in PGA Tour history. This after failing to claim a victory in his first 70 events on the PGA Tour.","Jaccard Noise_60":1.0,"Cosine Noise_60":1.0,"EM Noise_60":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_60":1,"Noise_80 Predicted Answer":"Scottie Scheffler","Noise_80 Document Index":"1","Noise_80 Document":"Apr 12, 2022 ...

His closest challenger eventually became McIlroy, who shot up the leaderboard following an outstanding eight-under par 64 to claim the clubhouse lead.            Even with the pressure of a potential Masters title on the line, though, Scheffler did not buckle, instead adding to his lead over the 14th and 15th holes to stretch it to five with just three holes remaining.            And from there, despite a wayward drive on the 17th, Scheffler managed to calm his nerves, right up until the final green on the 72nd hole.

The company detailed revenues of $18.76 billion and $2.86 worth of earnings per share, up from its Q1 2021 results of top line worth $10.389 billion and earnings per share of 93 cents.\u00a0 Tesla said it faced several challenges in the first quarter related to global supply chain, transportation, labor and manufacturing issues and that the problems could limit its ability to run its factories at full capacity. The automaker also warned of continued supply constraints that could hamper future production, despite the recent openings of its Gigafactories in Berlin and Texas that will build the Model Y. \u201cOur own factories have been running below capacity for several quarters as supply chain became the main limiting factor, which is likely to continue through the rest of 2022,\u201d the automaker said in its financial outlook. Tesla reported $3.32 billion worth of net income, a 658% increase from the $438 million reported for the same period last year. The company\u2019s profit result stands out as it is by far the company\u2019s largest in recent history, towering around $1 billion above its Q4 2021 net income results.

Finally from a big-number perspective, Tesla\u2019s operating activities kicked off just under $4.0 billion worth of cash in the quarter, up 143% from its year-ago result of $1.64 billion. Notably Tesla generated more positive operating cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2021 than it did to start 2022, but the decline feels modest when compared to the year-ago comparison. Despite these rosy numbers, there is one figure that illustrates the company\u2019s challenges. Supply chain issues are visible inside of Tesla\u2019s listed \u201cglobal vehicle delivery\u201d number, which is measured in number of days of available supply.\u00a0From a peak of nine days\u2019 worth of cars in Q2 2021, Tesla reported just a third of that figure, a slim three days, in Q1 2022.

The Forest Road Company originally was part of the Najafi consortium in taking over STX\u2019s debt, but it no longer is part of the revived studio going forward. All of this puts STX Entertainment in a position to remain independent, now completely separated from Eros International, which we\u2019ve heard has had its own financial baggage, further complicating affairs for the Burbank studio.

In December 2021, Jahm Najafi announced his intention to acquire STX from the merged company for $173 million\u2013a sale completed in April 2022. Eros remains a minority, non-voting shareholder.[1]  In 2012, Simonds and McGlashan began work on conceptualizing a media company based on the idea of producing medium-budget projects with a star attached, a method that had gone out of style with Hollywood studios. The conversation led to the launch of STX Entertainment in 2014, with the mission to finance, develop, produce, market, and distribute star-driven content around the world.[2][3] Investors in the company included Hony Capital, Tencent, PCCW, TPG Growth, and Liberty Global.

Macron triumphed decisively, although by a smaller margin than in 2017, when he won by more than 30 percentage points to became France's youngest president. While she fell short of the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace again in her third presidential run, Le Pen has secured the most votes ever for a French far-right candidate.

Still, the result was more decisive than the final polling averages that suggested Macron would win by a margin of 10 to 12 percentage points. The difference may be partly explained by late-deciding voters.

But a key question for Macron will be whether most of the people who voted for him embrace his platform, or whether they really wanted to prevent a Le Pen victory. There\u2019s not nearly the same level of enthusiasm for him as when he first ran in 2017, launching his own centrist political movement and becoming France\u2019s youngest president. The turnout rate on Sunday was projected to be 72 percent, according to France\u2019s public broadcaster, which would make it the lowest in the second round of a presidential election in half a century. He has disappointed some of his supporters by pushing through tax cuts for the wealthy, being less ambitious than some hoped on climate change, and tacking right on immigration in ways that were calculated to appeal to Le Pen voters but that also echoed the messages from migration-skeptic leaders in Hungary and elsewhere.

The lens on the main camera has a wider focal length, going from a 26mm equivalent on previous iPhone models to a 24mm one. It isn't drastically different, but it helps get more of the scene into the frame.   Just a cat under mixed lighting, as captured by the iPhone 14 Pro.

Though more megapixels doesn't necessarily mean better photos, Apple divides the pixels into groups of four and combines the four in each group into one larger pixel. This technique is called pixel binning, and it's been used on Android phones for years.

A lot of eyes are on Apple as concerns mount over an economic downturn in the United States. Here\u2019s what the company reported today.  For Q3 2022, Apple reported revenue of $83.0 billion and a profit of $19.4 billion. Earnings-per-share hit $1.20 for the quarter.  For Q3 2022, analyst predictions for revenue varied; $79.26B at the low end to $88.41B at the high end. The average across 26 analysts, however, was $82.81 billion.  Apple had not provided any guidance for Q3 2022, citing ongoing supply chain issues and continued disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, the company had even warned that supply constraints would cost it somewhere in the range of $4 billion to $8 billion in revenue for the quarter.  For comparison\u2019s sake, in the same quarter a year ago, Apple reported $81.43 billion in revenue and profit of $21.74 billion. It reported earnings-per-share of $1.30. These numbers were boosted heavily by pandemic-induced spending, driven by strong iPad and Mac revenue growth.

The bad news for the rest of the world is that the champion says she\u2019s only at 75 percent, as she\u2019s still recovering from a recent concussion and is dealing with stress fractures in both shins.

Tesla is raising the price of its \"Full Self Driving\" software to $15,000, Elon Musk said in a tweet on Sunday. Tesla is facing scrutiny from federal and state officials over how it has advertised its self-driving technology, as well as concern over safety risks involved with the self-driving capability. Customers who order the Full Self Driving, or FSD, software before Sept. 5 will receive the product under the current price, Musk, Tesla's CEO, said in the tweet. The $3K price bump arrives as Tesla introduces FSD beta 10.69, a new iteration that boasts \"improved overall driving smoothness\" and \"reduced false slowdowns near crosswalks,\" according to the company. The FSD software doesn't make a car fully self-driving. Rather, users must remain focused on the road and keep their hands on the driving wheel. The Autopilot system, meanwhile, offers navigation to and from user-provided destinations, as well as suggestions for lane changes and other maneuvers to optimize a trip. Tesla has come under sharp criticism over its marketing of the FSD software and Autopilot. Earlier this month, the California Department of Motor Vehicles alleged that the company deceptively advertises the products as fully autonomous, according to two filings with California's Office of Administrative Hearings. The filings were first reported by The Los Angeles Times.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.9999999404,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"$15,000","Noise_20 Document Index":"4","Noise_20 Document":"Keiron Berndt | Capital One  Article QuickTakes: Tesla has raised the price of its\u00a0Full Self-Driving (FSD) feature set again, this time to $15,000.

This latest hike is tied to a software update (FSD Beta 10.69.2), which improves overall driving smoothness through turns, enhances pedestrian and animal detection, and enables a creep-into-intersection function. Full Self-Driving is Tesla\u2019s disingenuously named suite of advanced driver-assistance features.

If you see little importance or utility in the last of those things, you can still get the bulk of Tesla\u2019s magic with Enhanced Autopilot. It costs a relative bargain, at $6,000, and gives your vehicle the ability to park itself and navigate a highway route from on-ramp to off-ramp (including automatic lane changes) with minimal driver involvement. It also includes Summon, which allows the driver to direct a car into or out of a tight parking space while standing outside the vehicle, and Smart Summon, which enables the vehicle to wind its way around objects (such as in a parking lot) to meet the driver.","Jaccard Noise_20":1.0,"Cosine Noise_20":0.9999999404,"EM Noise_20":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":1,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"200%","Noise_40 Document Index":"4","Noise_40 Document":"Sep 9, 2022 ...

Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.  Tesla\u2019s increasing the price of its Full-Self Driving (FSD) software to $15,000. In a post on Twitter, Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that the new price will go into effect in North America starting September 5th, representing a $3,000 jump. Drivers who order a vehicle before September 5th won\u2019t have to pay the newly-increased price, Musk says. The price hike comes as Tesla begins rolling out FSD beta 10.69 to drivers, a version Musk calls \u201ca big step forward.\u201d It\u2019s still unclear whether Tesla plans on raising the price of its FSD subscription, which currently costs $199 per month. The FSD software lets drivers use Tesla\u2019s advanced driving assistance system (ADAS), Autopilot, to navigate to and from specific destinations, among other driver-assist features. FSD doesn\u2019t make a vehicle fully autonomous; it requires drivers to keep their hands on the wheel and pay attention to the road at all times. The price of Tesla\u2019s FSD beta has slowly crept up over the years, and cost $5,000 upon launch.","Jaccard Noise_60":1.0,"Cosine Noise_60":0.9999999404,"EM Noise_60":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_60":1,"Noise_80 Predicted Answer":"$15,000","Noise_80 Document Index":"2","Noise_80 Document":"The move raises the price by $3,000, which amounts to a 25% hike.  Tesla is raising the price of its \"Full Self Driving\" software to $15,000, Elon Musk said in a tweet on Sunday. Tesla is facing scrutiny from federal and state officials over how it has advertised its self-driving technology, as well as concern over safety risks involved with the self-driving capability. Customers who order the Full Self Driving, or FSD, software before Sept. 5 will receive the product under the current price, Musk, Tesla's CEO, said in the tweet. The $3K price bump arrives as Tesla introduces FSD beta 10.69, a new iteration that boasts \"improved overall driving smoothness\" and \"reduced false slowdowns near crosswalks,\" according to the company. The FSD software doesn't make a car fully self-driving. Rather, users must remain focused on the road and keep their hands on the driving wheel. The Autopilot system, meanwhile, offers navigation to and from user-provided destinations, as well as suggestions for lane changes and other maneuvers to optimize a trip. Tesla has come under sharp criticism over its marketing of the FSD software and Autopilot. Earlier this month, the California Department of Motor Vehicles alleged that the company deceptively advertises the products as fully autonomous, according to two filings with California's Office of Administrative Hearings. The filings were first reported by The Los Angeles Times.","Jaccard Noise_80":1.0,"Cosine Noise_80":0.9999999404,"EM Noise_80":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":1,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"$15000","Noise_100 Document Index":"7","Noise_100 Document":"Sep 5, 2022 ...

(12:54) Fourteen months ago, USC quarterback Caleb Williams was a freshman backup at Oklahoma entering the Red River Rivalry game against Texas hoping to give the Sooners a spark. Now, the 20-year-old is a Heisman Trophy winner. On Saturday in New York, Williams -- much like he did on the field this year -- left no doubt that the Heisman was his, securing the award given to the most outstanding player in college football in a decisive victory. Williams outraced Georgia's Stetson Bennett, TCU's Max Duggan and Ohio State's C.J. Stroud for the award. Williams received 544 first-place votes. His 2,031 points easily beat out Duggan, who finished second. Stroud was third, followed by Bennett. \"I may be standing up here today, but y'all get to go to the College Football Playoff,\" Williams said in his acceptance speech, in saluting the other finalists in front of him. \"Guess you can't win them all.\" Over the course of 13 games this season, the former five-star recruit from the Washington, D.C., area dazzled with his play, throwing for 4,075 yards and 37 touchdowns with only four interceptions and rushing for 372 yards and 10 touchdowns.

Williams edged finalists Max Duggan of TCU, C.J. Stroud of Ohio State and Stetson Bennett IV of Georgia -- all quarterbacks -- to become the Trojans' first Heisman winner since running back Reggie Bush, who was later forced to vacate his 2005 award. Williams passed for 4,075 yards, 37 touchdowns and just four interceptions while completing 66.1% of his passes this season. He guided USC to an 11-2 record and appearance in the Pac-12 Championship Game where he played through injuries in a loss to Utah. His victory gives USC eight Heismans, most among any program in the nation.

Speculation swirled in the past about Sony seeking to buy the developer, but these rumors have since been debunked. However, with both Sony and Tencent buying into FromSoftware, such rumors have been rekindled. After all, 2022 has seen an unprecedented number of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) within the games industry: The year began with Take-Two acquiring mobile giant Zynga and the bombshell purchase of Activision Blizzard by Microsoft. Other high-profile acquisitions include Bungie and Haven Studios by Sony, and Crystal Dynamics, Eidos-Montr\u00e9al and Square Enix Montr\u00e9al by Embracer Group. The latter also recently acquired five more companies resulting in the acquisition of the rights to Lord of the Rings IP. Meanwhile, rumors continue to swirl that Ubisoft and EA are both seeking buyers. Finally, just yesterday, NetEase announced that it will be acquiring Beyond: Two Souls and Detroit: Become Human developer Quantic Dream. Of course the acquisition of shares doesn\u2019t necessarily signal interest in outright buying a company, but it\u2019s impossible to fault that line of thinking given the state of M&A activity this year.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.5,"Cosine Noise_0":0.7565184236,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Sony and Tencent","Noise_20 Document Index":"7","Noise_20 Document":"Sony and Tencent acquired a 30 percent stake of FromSoftware, the esteemed Japanese video game studio behind \u201cElden Ring\u201d and the Dark Souls series, Wednesday.

Sony Interactive Entertainment (a subsidiary of Sony behind the PlayStation brand) holds 14.09 percent of FromSoftware\u2019s shares; Sixjoy Hong Kong Limited (a subsidiary of Tencent) owns 16.25 percent, bringing the collective stake to 30.34 percent.

In the announcement, Kadokawa explained that the three companies had operated a \u201cstrategic alliance in the anime and game fields\u201d since October 2021.

In rather tedious news, Tencent and Sony Interactive Entertainment have acquired partial stakes in FromSoftware. More specifically, Tencent has 16.25% of shares and Sony Interactive Entertainment has 14.09% of shares in FromSoftware. The reason why this is boring is that Kadokawa is still the main owner (with 69.66% of the shares) and these new share acquisitions are both non-controlling stakes. In short, nothing has changed and neither Tencent nor Sony have any real decision-making power here. So if you were thinking that Sony would be able to force platform exclusivity for all future FromSoftware titles, then you would be wrong. This will just be business as usual, except that FromSoftware may have some more capital to play around with. One potentially interesting point here is that the money accrued from this will help FromSoftware bolster its publishing plans for the future. This is noteworthy because FromSoftware actually publishes its own games in Japan, so moving that to be more of a global endeavor would be better for all concerned. In that, in the past many of FromSoftware\u2019s games were released internationally by publishers that neither cared nor understood their games. The results were that FromSoftware\u2019s games were given no real international PR or marketing, and the localizations of these games were often thoroughly terrible as well.","Jaccard Noise_60":0.25,"Cosine Noise_60":0.5630176067,"EM Noise_60":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_60":1,"Noise_80 Predicted Answer":"Kadokawa","Noise_80 Document Index":"7","Noise_80 Document":"Kadokawa announced on Wednesday that Hong Kong-based Tencent subsidiary Sixjoy and Sony Interactive Entertainment have jointly acquired a 30.34% stake in game developer FromSoftware (Elden Ring, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, Dark Souls).

Is it going to be the metaverse? We're not there yet and that's really kind of what the challenge is.\" For Netflix, it's a question of growth, and what is and isn't on the table.

The mega-deal was all about strengthening Google's capabilities in detecting cyber threats \u2013 something Mandiant has become well-known for, said Google Cloud Chief Information Security Officer Phil Venables at a press conference yesterday. \u201cI want to emphasize that this is adding more frontline threat intelligence,\u201d Venables said. \u201cWhen you look at what we\u2019ve got existing at Google, which includes very complementary things from VirusTotal and our other threat intelligence capabilities, bringing that together really gives us this kind of end-to-end security operations stack. Again, Google Cloud is already strong when we think about how we analyze data and put it in context, and that only gets stronger with Mandiant.\u201d Venables was very clear that Google Cloud's ambitions in cybersecurity are massive, but on some level, the size of the deal already said it all. The acquisition is Google's second-largest ever, surpassed only by the company's $12.5 billion buyout of Motorola ten years ago. The more than $5 billion the company spent on Mandiant overshadows even what Google shelled out for Fitbit, which it bought for $2.1 billion.

So we can\u2019t ignore the significance of cloud cybersecurity moving forward as we continue to go completely digital in so many aspects of our lives. Cybersecurity companies are fighting for market share as data breaches and ransomware attacks become more common, more damaging and more expensive. With many companies turning towards cloud technology, it\u2019s no secret that companies like Google, Amazon and Microsoft are going to increase focus on this business sector. That said, Google\u2019s recent acquisition of the cyber security company, Mandiant, has stirred up a lot of conversation about the future of cloud cybersecurity and the highly competitive landscape therein. We\u2019re going to look at this space to see how much money the big players are making. It was announced on September 12 that Google\u2019s $5.4 billion bid to acquire the cybersecurity firm Mandiant was completed. Mandiant will be joining Google\u2019s cloud computing division so Google can attempt to compete with Amazon\u2019s AWS and Microsoft\u2019s Azure. This is Google\u2019s second-largest acquisition as the company aims to focus on enhancing its security operations suite and advisory services. With companies worldwide facing cyberattacks, the cloud cybersecurity space is expanding, and fast. With over 17 years of experience, Mandiant is a publicly-traded cybersecurity company that rose to prominence by discovering the SolarWinds attack where 18,000 clients unknowingly downloaded malware.","Jaccard Noise_20":1.0,"Cosine Noise_20":0.9275108576,"EM Noise_20":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":1,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"$5.4 billion","Noise_40 Document Index":"5","Noise_40 Document":"Checking Accounts Best Credit Cards for Small Business Best Small Business Loans Best Tax Software for Small Business SELECT All Taxes Best Tax Software Best Tax Software for Small Businesses Tax Refunds SELECT All Help for Low Credit Scores Best Credit Cards for Bad Credit Best Personal Loans for Bad Credit Best Debt Consolidation Loans for Bad Credit Personal Loans if You Don't Have Credit Best Credit Cards for Building Credit Personal Loans for 580 Credit Score or Lower Personal Loans for 670 Credit Score or Lower Best Mortgages for Bad Credit Best Hardship Loans How to Boost Your Credit Score SELECT All Investing Best IRA Accounts Best Roth IRA Accounts Best Investing Apps Best Free Stock Trading Platforms Best Robo-Advisors Index Funds Mutual Funds ETFs Bonds  In this article Google announced Tuesday that it plans to buy cybersecurity firm\u00a0Mandiant\u00a0for around $5.4 billion as part of an effort to better protect its cloud customers.

It is the best-selling Zelda game and one of the best-selling video games of all time, with 32.35 million copies sold by 2023.  Breath of the Wild is considered one of the greatest video games of all time. Journalists described it as a landmark in open-world design for its emphasis on experimentation, physics-based sandbox, and emergent gameplay. Numerous developers cited Breath of the Wild as inspiration, and it is a popular point of comparison among open-world games. A spin-off, Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity, was released in 2020 while a sequel, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, was released in 2023.  Breath of the Wild is an open world action-adventure game. Players are tasked with exploring the kingdom of Hyrule while controlling Link. Breath of the Wild encourages nonlinear gameplay, which is illustrated by the game's lack of defined entrances or exits to areas,[1] scant instruction given to the player, and encouragement to explore freely.[2] Breath of the Wild introduces a consistent physics engine to the Zelda series, letting players approach problems in different ways rather than trying to find a single solution.[3] The game also integrates a \"chemistry engine\" that defines the physical properties of most objects and governs how they interact with the player and one another.","Jaccard Noise_40":0.5,"Cosine Noise_40":0.6055281162,"EM Noise_40":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":1,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"Tears of the Kingdom","Noise_60 Document Index":"3","Noise_60 Document":"When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.

Ever since Nintendo announced its sequel to 2017\u2019s The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, several titles for the upcoming RPG have been leaked; however so far none have gone on to show even a glimmer of accuracy. Nintendo first announced that a sequel to Breath of the Wild was in development all the way back in 2019 at an E3 Nintendo Direct presentation. During this presentation, fans were treated to a dark and mysterious trailer that showed Link and Princess Zelda as they travelled through a murky underground dungeon to the corpse of Ganondorf. The corpse soon reanimates itself and grabs the Hero of Time as waves of ghostly light are emitted all around them. Since that particular Breath of the Wild 2 announcement, fans have heard no more about it from Nintendo. Instead, Nintendo revealed Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity out of the blue in September 2020, with the Dynasty Warriors-spin off releasing shortly after in November. The news of Age of Calamity made it the first time in the Zelda franchise\u2019s history that both a prequel and sequel for one game were in production at the same time.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.3300043643,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

Here\u2019s how it works Home \/ Features \/ Google Pixel Watch 2: the features we want from a smartwatch successor  The first Pixel Watch was a solid start - but there's room for improvement Android fans had a lot to like about the Google Pixel Watch when it landed in October 2022: a minimal design, slick Fitbit integration, and the best version of the firm\u2019s Wear OS software to date. Google\u2019s first wearable effort wasn\u2019t perfect, though. Battery life was a real downer, and the \u201cone size fits all\u201d approach was off-kilter with the rest of the smartwatch world. That leaves plenty of areas for a Pixel Watch 2 to improve upon. At the time of writing there\u2019s still a fairly long wait before a successor is set to turn up \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t look to the future, or come up with a laundry list of things we\u2019d like to see make the cut by the time it does. Google hasn\u2019t said anything official about a second Pixel Watch. At the annual I\/O event in May 2023, it quickly breezed over WearOS to leave more time to focus on AI, coding and other upcoming hardware like the Pixel Fold smartphone. The only info we have to go on right now is a single tweet from prolific phone leaker EVleaks.","Jaccard Noise_80":0.3333333333,"Cosine Noise_80":0.7387959957,"EM Noise_80":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":0,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"2022","Noise_100 Document Index":"0","Noise_100 Document":"Google is a brand that we all know and either love or hate. Aside from being the company behind many web services, Google has done quite well with its Pixel smartphones \u2014 with the latest being the Google Pixel 7 family. In 2022, Google also released its first smartwatch, the Google Pixel Watch, though it received mixed reviews overall. We\u2019re expecting Google to release a follow-up to the Pixel Watch sometime this year in the form of the Pixel Watch 2 and, hopefully, it will improve upon what was already established with the original. Though there haven\u2019t been a lot of leaked reports about the Pixel Watch 2, here\u2019s what we know so far about the upcoming smartwatch. The Google Pixel Watch launched with a unique aesthetic that was both modern and minimalistic. With that in mind, we should expect the Google Pixel Watch 2 to have the same kind of design, with a domed display, rotating digital crown, and unobtrusive band mechanisms. However, if Google could improve anything with the design here, it should start with thinner bezels on the round display. Durability should be around the same as the first Pixel Watch, and it\u2019s expected to run a version of Wear OS, possibly Wear OS 4. This would mean a clean, Google-focused user experience with customizable tiles, Fitbit integration, and third-party app support. Since the original Google Pixel Watch had Fitbit integration, that should continue with the Google Pixel Watch 2.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.4684274197,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

Though Abe was Japan's longest-serving leader in Japan's modern history, he was not the most popular. His years in office were plagued by scandals and he left behind many unfulfilled political goals, including the unsuccessful push to \"normalize\" the nation by revising its pacifist constitution. Polls show roughly 6 in 10 Japanese people opposed his state-funded funeral. Hundreds of thousands signed petitions calling for the event to be halted. Detractors argued that the state-funded event will essentially force all citizens of Japan to express sadness for the departed leader. The government, however, assured the public that \"every citizen will not be required to engage in mourning.\" On Sunday night, hundreds gathered near Tokyo's bustling Shinjuku station with placards and loudspeakers to demonstrate against the state funeral. \"In these tough times, there is no need for taxpayer money to finance this.

(Kyodo News via AP)         TOKYO (AP) \u2014 A rare state funeral for Shinzo Abe, the former prime minister who was assassinated in July, has split Japan.  The hawkish Abe was one of the nation\u2019s most divisive postwar leaders, but it is the ruling party\u2019s cozy ties with the ultra-conservative Unification Church that has fired up much of the opposition to the funeral.  Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is battling a near-continuous political fallout from his handling of both the links to the church among his party\u2019s lawmakers and the state funeral he says Abe deserves.  A look at some of the reasons why the state funeral on Tuesday is causing so much anger:  The tradition has roots in a ceremony performed by the emperor to honor those who made exceptional contributions to the country.  The emperor before World War II was revered as a god, and public mourning for those honored with state funerals was compulsory. Most state funerals were for members of the imperial family, but political and military leaders were also honored, including Isoroku Yamamoto, who commanded Japan\u2019s Pearl Harbor attack and died in 1943.  The state funeral law was scrapped after the war.","Jaccard Noise_80":0.0,"Cosine Noise_80":0.4757463336,"EM Noise_80":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":0,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"Monday","Noise_100 Document Index":"1","Noise_100 Document":"Sep 26, 2022 ...

Max Verstappen secured his second World Championship title after finishing first, in front of Sergio P\u00e9rez and Charles Leclerc. Despite only 28 of the scheduled 53 laps being completed, full points were awarded due to a loophole in the regulations regarding how points should be allocated, with the rules stating that reduced points should only be awarded in shortened races that end under red flag conditions. As this race ended under green flag conditions, this system was not applied. The wording of the sporting regulations was subsequently amended for 2023, so races that do not reach the 75 percent distance are awarded shortened race points regardless of whether a race finishes under red or green flag conditions.  The event was held across the weekend of the 7\u20139 October. It was the eighteenth round of the 2022 Formula One World Championship and the first time the event had been held since 2019, with the 2020 and 2021 races cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

It makes him a double world champion at 25 and now he's close to breaking Formula 1's record for most wins in a single season, with four events still left to run. But Verstappen's title celebrations were overshadowed by the chaos and confusion during and after the wet race last Sunday, which has led to even more questions being raised about the procedures and attitudes of motorsport's governing body. There was also plenty of intrigue further down the field and off the track too. Here are the headline takeaways from F1's first visit back to Suzuka in three years. Verstappen hugs Adrian Newey after claiming a second F1 world title Photo by: Sam Bloxham \/ Motorsport Images It had been coming ever since Charles Leclerc crashed out of the lead of the French GP: Verstappen was going to be the 2022 world champion. After his Suzuka triumph and the Ferrari driver's latest error gifting Sergio Perez second, came Verstappen's coronation. Although, as we'll get to soon, not immediately. Having missed his first, slim chance to seal the title in Singapore seven days earlier, Verstappen wrested control in Japan.

This wording change satisfies the original intention of the gradual scale points system when it was introduced in 2022.[17]  The deployment and position of the recovery vehicle on the track was criticised after AlphaTauri driver Pierre Gasly narrowly missed the vehicle due to poor visibility, angrily remonstrated that \"[he] could have killed [himself]\" if he had lost control and hit the vehicle, even at reduced speed.[18] Gasly also attacked the deployment as \"disrespectful\" to the memory and family of his childhood friend Jules Bianchi, who suffered fatal injuries at the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix when he crashed into a recovery vehicle after aquaplaning off the circuit. Bianchi's godson Charles Leclerc also said that the sport should learn from Bianchi's death and not have similar issues in the future, and Bianchi's father wrote on Instagram that the race officials had \"no respect\" for either the life of the drivers or Bianchi's memory. The FIA confirmed there would be an investigation into the deployment of recovery vehicles.[19]  Notes","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.2560200691,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

Presently, the GeForce RTX 4090 is the top-of-the-line card in Nvidia's 40-series of GeForce RTX GPUs, which were officially announced in September 2022. The Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 and 4090 were unveiled during Nvidia's September 2022 GTC keynote. Together, they've established a new high-water mark for what we can expect from consumer-grade graphics cards. At that Nvidia event, we learned when these cards are coming out, how much they'll cost, and what kind of power we ought to expect from them. The Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 is the cream of the crop \u2014 here's everything you need to know about it. The Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 went on sale on October 12, 2022.

While the $1,599 price tag on the new 4090 is anything but, the other cards in Nvidia's new 40-series should be significantly cheaper.

Will the RTX 4060 become one of the best GPUs, or at least one of the most popular models in this generation? One might think that a GPU that costs over $40,000 is going to be the best graphics card for gaming, but the truth is a lot more complex than that. In fact, this Nvidia GPU can't even keep up with integrated graphics solutions.

Here's what the subscription plan offers and whether you should sign up for YouTube Premium. If you love watching videos on YouTube, you might have considered subscribing to YouTube Premium. But is YouTube Premium worth it? Let's take a look at what YouTube Premium offers, what you should know about the service, and how to decide if it's worthwhile for you. YouTube Premium (formerly YouTube Red) costs $11.99 per month, after a one-month free trial. If you're sure about the service and want to commit for a year, there's an annual plan available for $119.99. That's two months of savings for paying upfront.  There are also two other plans available for families and students. The Family plan for YouTube Premium costs $22.99 per month. It allows you to add up to five other people (six total members) who are at least 13 years old and live in your household so they get the same benefits. Per YouTube's terms, these people must live at the same address as you. If you're a student who can provide verification (required each year), the price of the Student YouTube Premium plan is $6.99 per month instead. Whether the cost of Premium is worth it or not depends on how many of YouTube Premium's benefits you use.

{"Query":"Who voices Batman in Batwheels?","Correct Answer":["Ethan Hawke"],"Noise_0 Predicted Answer":"Ethan Hawke","Noise_0 Document Index":"5","Noise_0 Document":"The animated series is set to premiere next month. Ethan Hawke is Batman in a new clip from the upcoming animated series Batwheels, as he races against the Joker on the rain-slicked, CG streets of Gotham City. Fittingly for the vehicular nature of the series, it displays the abilities of both the Batmobile and the Joker's gaudily-decorated van. In this preschool-aimed series, the first from DC, Batman is assisted in his never-ending crusade against crime by a squad of sentient, super-powered vehicles, the titular Batwheels. They include the Bam, the Batmobile (Jacob Bertrand), Bibi, the Batgirl Cycle (Madigan Kacmar), Redbird, Robin's Sports Car (Jordan Reed), Batwing, the Jet Plane (Lilimar), and Buff, the Bat Truck (Noah Bentley). Newly granted sentience by the Batcomputer (Kimberly D. Brooks), the child-like Batwheels will learn about the world around them as well as the ins and outs of fighting super villains starting this fall, under the Cartoonito brand streaming on HBO Max and broadcast on Cartoon Network. Ethan Hawke has been ubiquitous lately, turning up in the sleeper horror hit The Black Phone, in the critically-acclaimed The Northman, and in Marvel's Moon Knight. He is a newcomer to the world of animation, with only a single guest voice on an episode of Robot Chicken to his name.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.9999999404,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Ethan Hawke","Noise_20 Document Index":"3","Noise_20 Document":"A first look of Ethan Hawke as the voice of Batman in\u00a0Batwheels, the upcoming animated series debuting as part of the preschool block on Cartoonito on HBO Max and Cartoon Network, was revealed today.\u00a0 \u00a0 The new clip features a scene from the upcoming half-hour special, \u201cSecret Origin of the Batwheels,\u201d premiering on\u00a0Batman Day, Sept. 17, exclusively first on\u00a0Cartoonito on HBO Max.

Sunak, who is the U.K.\u2019s first leader of color, met King Charles III at Buckingham Palace, where the monarch officially asked the new leader of the governing Conservative Party to form a government, as is tradition.

{"Query":"which party controls the house after 2022 midterm elections?","Correct Answer":["Republican "],"Noise_0 Predicted Answer":"Democrats","Noise_0 Document Index":"5","Noise_0 Document":"A Republican House will likely clash on most issues with a Democratic Senate in 2023, with bitter fights over basic functions like funding the government threatening to paralyze Washington.    GOP candidates hoped to capitalize on voter frustration with the rising costs of groceries and gas, framing the election as a referendum on President Joe Biden and his party's rule of both the White House and Congress. But voters in exit polls indicated other issues like abortion rights and protecting democracy factored into their decisions at the ballot box. Redistricting in New York and Florida also helped the GOP overcome lackluster results in most of the races rated as toss-ups. The last time the president and top congressional leaders were from different parties was 2019, when Democrats regained control of the House in the 2018 midterms, two years after former President Donald Trump was elected president.  A new House Republican majority will mean Biden's legislative agenda is essentially dead, unless he can find bipartisan support for some narrowly crafted proposals. Biden's focus during the next two years of his presidency will likely be spent defending his signature accomplishments, like a bill lowering prescription drug prices and investing hundreds of billions of dollars to tackle climate change. GOP lawmakers have already said they want to roll back some of Biden's programs, or defund many of them.  The Biden White House will also face an onslaught of investigations on a wide range of issues.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.6566407681,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":0,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Democratic Party","Noise_20 Document Index":"0","Noise_20 Document":"Nov 12, 2022 ... \u201cElection Week\u201d is coming to a close with control of the House still up ... to the Democratic Party's tally, and four races to Republicans'.","Jaccard Noise_20":0.0,"Cosine Noise_20":0.6260359287,"EM Noise_20":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":0,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"Democrats","Noise_40 Document Index":"1","Noise_40 Document":"This projection was based on a variety of metrics, including generic ballot testing that favored a Republican-led Congress as well as President Biden\u2019s low approval rating, which hovers around 40%. Super PACS and political party groups were spending money almost exclusively in districts that President Biden won in 2020, indicating that Democrats were in a defensive crouch. Midterm elections often benefit the opposition political party at the expense of the White House\u2019s party. 1994 and 2010 were typical midterm elections, where Republicans made gains in the House at the midpoint of Bill Clinton and Barack Obama\u2019s first terms. Similarly, in 2018, Republican\u2019s got crushed in House elections but picked up two seats in the Senate. If a president\u2019s approval ratings are high, then the presiding party typically fares better in midterm House elections. For example, in 1998, Bill Clinton\u2019s approval rating was 66%, and Democrats retained control of the House. In 2002, George W. Bush polled at a 63%, and Republicans made gains. Currently, Biden\u2019s approval rating is 42%, which is similar to former president Barack Obama\u2019s rating in 2010.

Millie Gibson will be the new Doctor Who companion, joining Ncuti Gatwa for adventures in time and space. The casting was revealed during this year's Children in Need broadcast on BBC One. Gibson, best known for playing Kelly Neelan on ITV soap Coronation Street for three years, will play a character named Ruby Sunday. Alongside Gatwa, Millie Gibson will make her Doctor Who debut over the festive season in 2023 when the Fifteenth Doctor takes control of the TARDIS. \"Whilst still being in total disbelief, I am beyond honoured to be cast as the Doctor\u2019s companion,\" said Gibson. \"It is a gift of a role, and a dream come true, and I will do everything to try and fill the boots the fellow companions have travelled in before me. And what better way to do that than being by the fabulous Ncuti Gatwa\u2019s side, I just can\u2019t wait to get started.\" Gatwa added: \"Millie just is the companion. She is full of talent, strength, she has a cheeky sparkle in her eye and is sharp as a razor. From the moment she walked into the room she captured all of our attention with her effervescence and then solidified that attention with the sheer torque of her talent.

Not only is fan favorite David Tennant returning to the franchise for a series of specials, but Ncuti Gatwa has been cast as the Fifteenth Doctor, the first black actor to play the iconic hero. While little is known about the new Doctor, the BBC did announce that Millie Gibson has been cast as Ruby Sunday, the Doctor's new companion. Much attention has been paid to Tennant's return and Gatwa's casting, but Gibson is an exciting choice for the franchise. The companion is just as important for Doctor Who as the Doctor himself, so the person cast in the role takes on a big responsibility. At just 18 years old, she will be the youngest person to be cast as a companion and was only a one-year-old when the series was revived in 2005. Is the young star ready for such a major role? Her casting might be the key to understanding the new direction for the series. The Doctor's companion is an important role in the series, but this is a performance on a television series. This is not the same as an actual medical doctor or a firefighter where one does expect years of training and a certain level of experience to be considered qualified.","Jaccard Noise_20":1.0,"Cosine Noise_20":1.0,"EM Noise_20":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":1,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"David Tennant","Noise_40 Document Index":"9","Noise_40 Document":"\"It's the great honor of my job to find the next generation of talent, and Millie shines like a star already,\" said showrunner Russell T.

It's incredibly well-written and provides viewers with a glimpse of the Doctor's human side. Even before that though, Rose had a big impact on the series. Being the first companion of the modern era of Doctor Who may have phased some, but Billie Piper takes to the role like a duck to water. Rose's outgoing personality helped to bring balance to Eccleston's sullen and serious interpretation of the Doctor, while also playing a key, albeit, questionable, role in the events of the first series' climax.  Sarah-Jane Smith is easily the most popular companion of the classic era of Doctor Who and even returned for several of the modern episodes. She was first introduced as a traveling partner for the third Doctor back in 1973 though, before eventually going on to interact with eight of the other 12 doctors in some way, shape, or form. She was there when Davros created the Daleks on Skaro and came up against many of the series' most iconic villains at one point or another. Such was her popularity with series fans that Sarah-Jane even got her own spin-off series called The Sarah-Jane Adventures, which ran for five full seasons before Elisabeth Sladen's untimely death in 2011.","Jaccard Noise_60":0.0,"Cosine Noise_60":0.4239652455,"EM Noise_60":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_60":0,"Noise_80 Predicted Answer":"Ruby Sunday","Noise_80 Document Index":"7","Noise_80 Document":"This means, the time of the 13th Doctor generally consisted of a pretty packed TARDIS. With showrunner Russell T Davies returning to Who (he relaunched the show back in 2005) it seems he\u2019s slipping back into familiar formats for the series, starting with giving Ncuti Gatwa one best friend, instead of several. \u201cThey are the eyes into [the Doctor\u2019s] world,\u201d Gibson said to Gatwa. \u201cAnd they are the audience\u2019s eyes to see what will happen in your [the Doctor\u2019s] universe.\u201d  Will Ruby Sunday remain the only companion of Gatwa\u2019s Doctor throughout his run?

Most reappearances of companions in the original series, however, were for anniversary specials such as The Five Doctors and Dimensions in Time, both of which also featured multiple Doctors. One former companion, Sarah Jane Smith, together with the robotic dog K-9, appeared in four and two episodes, respectively, of the revived series[14] more than twenty years after their last appearances in the 20th anniversary story The Five Doctors (1983). The character of Sarah Jane also headed up a Doctor Who spin-off, The Sarah Jane Adventures, with K-9 until Sladen's death. Another companion, Captain Jack Harkness, is the lead character in the spin-off BBC science fiction programme Torchwood. Not only have these former companions continued to make appearances on Doctor Who, they have sometimes been accompanied by some of their own companions from the spin-offs when doing so, including Jack's colleagues Gwen Cooper and Ianto Jones, and Sarah Jane's 'family' Mr Smith, Luke Smith and K-9 Mark IV.

{"Query":"What is the title of the new season of \"Criminal Minds\"?","Correct Answer":["Evolution"],"Noise_0 Predicted Answer":"Criminal Minds: Evolution","Noise_0 Document Index":"1","Noise_0 Document":"The Criminal Minds reboot on Paramount+ gets a brand new title which effectively resolves one of the biggest problems of the upcoming series.  The Criminal Minds reboot's new title - Criminal Minds: Evolution - resolves one of its biggest problems. Paramount+ is bringing back FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit (BAU) to the small screen not long after the team wrapped up its run on CBS for 15 years. While the profilers will miss a couple of their co-workers such as Matthew Gray Gubler's Spencer Reid and Daniel Henney's Matt Simmons, the rest of the squad will be intact as they track down a network of UnSubs which was established during the coronavirus pandemic. Many aspects of the original Criminal Minds run will stay the same, but Evolutions has some fresh aspects, including a new title. Retitling Paramount+'s Criminal Minds revival as Criminal Minds: Evolution is appropriate given this new version of the show. The project is a continuation of its CBS run, so technically, it isn't really a \"reboot\" as it has usually been referred to. The cast remains the same and its events take place in the same continuity. Instead of calling it Criminal Minds season 16, however, giving it a different title allows it to separate itself from the CBS procedural without totally severing its ties with it. It also hints that everything in Criminal Minds: Evolution is an evolved version of the original show, which seems to be the case.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.3333333333,"Cosine Noise_0":0.3522495031,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Evolution","Noise_20 Document Index":"4","Noise_20 Document":"The sixteenth season of the American police procedural crime drama television series Criminal Minds, subtitled Evolution,  follows members of the Behavioral Analysis Unit (BAU) as they are faced with a network of serial killers built during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In January 2023, Evolution was renewed for another season.[3]  In February 2021, a revival series and the sixteenth season of Criminal Minds was announced to be in early development at Paramount+ with 10 episodes planned.[7][8] In February 2022, the series was confirmed to be still in development.[9] Paramount+ officially gave a series order in July 2022.[10] The official title of the new series was revealed in September 2022.[1]  Most of the main cast of the last season of the previous series returned, with the exception of Matthew Gray Gubler and Daniel Henney.[10] On September 4, 2022, Josh Stewart confirmed he would reprise his role as Will LaMontagne Jr.[4] On September 9, 2022, Zach Gilford was cast in a recurring role.[1]  Filming began in August 2022.","Jaccard Noise_20":1.0,"Cosine Noise_20":1.0,"EM Noise_20":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":1,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"Paramount+","Noise_40 Document Index":"0","Noise_40 Document":"Dec 15, 2022 ...

It has been a while since the profilers' last on-screen case, but the characters' stories continued during that period. Granted that revival retcons the Criminal Minds finale in several ways, it's essentially the same thing. That being said, Paramount+ just cannot simply use the title Criminal Minds season 16 because the project is different in a couple of significant ways from its original run. That includes veering away from its episodic storytelling format to a more serialized one, not to mention being darker and more disturbing than CBS' iteration. By giving the Criminal Minds revival a new title, Paramount+ allows it to be both a reboot and a continuation of the CBS series. Calling it Criminal Minds season 16 could also be confusing if the project doesn\u2019t address every single plot line that the finale left loose, which puts a lot of burden on the new series. Having its official title of Criminal Minds: Evolution quickly establishes that the show is part of the Criminal Minds brand, which could entice some formers fans to check it out, especially those who haven\u2019t been keeping track of Paramount+\u2019s efforts to bring back the BAU on the small screen.

He's credited for improving the football programs at both Baylor and Temple while serving as a head coach. While coaching at Temple from 2013 to 2016, Rhule and the Owls won 28 games.

Rhule has yet to coach his first game for the Cornhuskers, though, and the true test of his popularity will come in a year or two, when his work to bring back one of college football's biggest brands is fully underway. So far, he's proved to be a fast study and served up big portions of red meat, frequently referencing the program's traditional staples of hard work, physical practices and a pounding run game. Unlike some previous coaches, Rhule has made a point to pay homage to program standard-bearer Tom Osborne, the 86-year-old Hall of Fame coach who won national titles three of the four years before his retirement. Osborne has already done a roundtable discussion with Rhule and athletic director Trev Alberts and accepted Rhule's invitation to be featured speaker at the annual coaches clinic. Rhule also played an important role in helping Alberts get former coach Frank Solich to agree to be honored at Saturday's spring game.

It wanted a former college athlete, an exec passionate about higher education, an established corporate leader and a savvy politician who knows how to get things done in government. The governing body found all of those traits and more in Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker, a former Harvard basketball athlete and avid sports fan. The NCAA announced today that it has selected the two-term governor to be its next president. Baker will replace outgoing NCAA President Mark Emmert starting March 1. His second term as governor is slated to conclude Jan. 5; he announced about a year ago that he wouldn\u2019t seek a third term. Emmert will stay on as an adviser through June. The NCAA\u2019s choice of Baker, 66, signifies the association\u2019s desire to have a leader who is well-versed in the ways that Washington, D.C., works. With the NCAA facing so many legal and legislative challenges, the board of governors, who made the hire, focused on someone from the political arena early in the process and Baker emerged as the candidate with the experience and expertise to navigate the governmental and athletic worlds that often collide in college sports. When asked why he wanted the job, Baker replied, \u201cBecause it\u2019s worth doing.

If the Power 5 conferences want to allow the NCAA to stage national basketball tournaments and championships in other sports, that's about the only way I can see a significantly relevant NCAA surviving. It has bungled just about everything else under Emmert's watch, from fighting an outdated amateurism model in the courts (and losing hundreds of millions in dollars in legal fees and plaintiffs' awards) to picking and choosing which schools to penalize for campus-wide sexual assault scandals to introducing a new enforcement process, the Independent Accountability Resolution Process, that added months, if not years, to the adjudication of significant infractions cases.

The inequities between the men and women were obvious and stark, which put the NCAA into damage-control mode. At that point, those in the women's basketball world had to question if Emmert was very sincere in his concern, but there was a \"better-late-than-never\" sentiment. And the NCAA's decision to commission the so-called Kaplan report, which did a deep dive into inequities in all men's and women's NCAA championships, was an important step because it didn't pull any punches about how significant those issues have been. The report also said the NCAA has been selling women's sports short regarding potential television revenue. When it's time to negotiate TV rights again, rather than selling multiple championships in a bargain bundle, the NCAA needs to think bigger about the worth of each championship and how best to maximize revenue from it. Also, the NCAA has to show more leadership regarding the inclusion of transgender athletes in competition. As with so many things, the NCAA has been behind on this. Dave Wilson: The next leader is going to have to get creative to figure out the mess of issues currently embroiling college sports, or finally just step out of the way and put on tournaments.

On May 10, 2023, he purchased a Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT for 50 ETH on Blur. At the time, the purchase was equal to about $90,000. Why is this so notable? When Alegre made his purchase, the floor price for Bored Ape NFTs was about 44 ETH (around $78,000), according to CoinGecko.  In short, Alegre used his own money to buy an NFT from his own company \u2014 and he bought it for quite a bit more than he needed to. Through his purchase, Alegre likely hoped to demonstrate his belief in the BAYC NFT project and, more broadly, Yuga Labs\u2019 portfolio of intellectual properties. Currently, this portfolio includes nearly all of the most widely known and valuable projects in the NFT space \u2014 Bored Ape Yacht Club, Otherside, Mutant Ape Yacht Club, Bored Ape Kennel Club, CryptoPunks, and Meebits.","Jaccard Noise_60":1.0,"Cosine Noise_60":1.0,"EM Noise_60":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_60":1,"Noise_80 Predicted Answer":"Daniel Alegre","Noise_80 Document Index":"5","Noise_80 Document":"Jul 13, 2023 ...

The company has also faced criticism for its handling of the situation and the toxic work environment that allegedly exists within the company. This has resulted in significant public backlash, with some fans and employees calling for boycotts and protests. Alegre\u2019s departure from Activision to Yuga Labs may be seen as a positive move for those who are critical of Activision\u2019s leadership and culture. It\u2019s worth noting that the gaming industry and the NFT space have both been the subject of intense scrutiny and controversy in recent years. The allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination at Activision Blizzard have been a particularly significant source of controversy in the gaming industry. Meanwhile, the NFT space has faced criticism for its environmental impact and the high levels of speculation and price volatility surrounding some NFTs. Furthermore, the recent fake news surrounding Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) highlights the need for responsible and informed reporting in the NFT space. Given these issues, the appointment of Alegre as Yuga Labs\u2019 CEO marks an interesting new phase for the company.

However, the story of the Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) film is set in Fascist Italy during the interwar period and World War Two. \"Pinocchio\" prevailed over other popular nominees A24's stop-motion film \"Marcel the Shell With Shoes On\" and the Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) 3D animated film \"Turning Red.\" Del Toro has many accolades, including his 2018 Oscar wins for best picture and best director for \"The Shape of Water.","Jaccard Noise_20":1.0,"Cosine Noise_20":0.9961767197,"EM Noise_20":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":1,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"The Shape of Water","Noise_40 Document Index":"1","Noise_40 Document":"His Pinocchio stands out because it deals with existential issues such as mortality, morality and what we define as consciousness, coupled with real-world historical catastrophes such as the rise of fascism and the children who have suffered under its jackboot.

Pinocchio \u2013 an innocent who is forced to see the harsh realities of war, death and societal collapse, yet retains a sense of optimism \u2013 is prescient amid intensifying global conflict and offers hope. Del Toro is no stranger to awards success. In 2007, his breakout hit Pan\u2019s Labyrinth won the Hugo award for best dramatic presentation. He also won the best director and best picture Oscars for The Shape of Water in 2017. In some ways, Pinocchio\u2019s win was predictable. The film has, without doubt, received more press coverage than its rivals through a powerfully sustained campaign. Pinocchio\u2019s fellow nominees \u2013 Puss in Boots, The Sea Beast and Turning Red \u2013  are typical of the state and quality of animation in 2023. They\u2019re colourful, entertaining and wonderfully animated, but rather standard CGI creations, with none of the more complex tones of del Toro\u2019s Pinocchio.

If you have a small business with less than 300 users, then the most interesting plans are the Microsoft 365 Business plans. Large organizations will have to look at the Office 365 Enterprise and Microsoft 365 plans. I have also written a couple of articles where I go more into detail between the different plans, you can find the links further down in the article. The table below will help you to compare the Office 365 plans. The prices are based on an annual subscription model. Enterprise plans are only available in a yearly agreement. For most small businesses is the Microsoft 365 Business Standard plan the best choice. With a price of $12.50 per user per month, you get the full Office 365 suite, with the desktop apps, Exchange Online, SharePoint, OneDrive, etc. Everything you need to get your business started in the cloud.

By the end of 2023, Zack Snyder will be back behind the camera for Rebel Moon. The fan-favorite director will test his skills in an epic space opera heading to Netflix later this year. Here\u2019s all the information we know about the Rebel Moon release date. Netflix set the Rebel Moon release date for December 22, 2023. One of the most-anticipated movies in 2023, Rebel Moon was penned by Snyder, Shay Hatten, and Kurt Johnstad. Snyder has directed many movies that can be labeled as sci-fi, proof is his long commitment to the DC Universe superheroes in what was nicknamed the \u201cSnyderverse.\u201d However, Space Moon will be his first space opera. The 57-year-old director started his partnership with Netflix with 2021\u2019s Army of the Dead, a zombie movie that featured an epic heist.  Inspired by Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa and Star Wars, Rebel Moon follows a peaceful colony dealing with an oppressive regent. Still, many details are under wrap, and the movie hasn\u2019t even got a trailer. Yet, Netflix believes so very much in the Rebel Moon potential of the film that a sequel is being filmed back-to-back. Originally, Snyder approached Lucasfilm with his story, but the project never sailed there. Instead, it took the current form after the involvement of producer Eric Newman.","Jaccard Noise_60":0.6666666667,"Cosine Noise_60":0.8899132609,"EM Noise_60":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_60":1,"Noise_80 Predicted Answer":"2023","Noise_80 Document Index":"7","Noise_80 Document":"REBEL MOON.

All Rights Reserved. Republican congressman Buddy Carter of Georgia questioned TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew on how safe the popular app is for children. TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew testified Thursday at a congressional hearing over concerns about user data collected by the popular video-sharing app and potential Chinese spying. Under his helm, TikTok reached 150 million users in the U.S., the majority of them teens and young adults who are attracted to the app\u2019s simple interface and addictive algorithm that serves up short videos on just about any imaginable topic. Lawmakers have said they\u2019re worried about American data falling into the hands of the Chinese government and claim it threatens national security and user privacy and could be used to promote pro-Beijing propaganda and misinformation.  Chew attempted to persuade lawmakers not to pursue a ban on the app or force Chinese parent company ByteDance to give up its ownership stake, testifying that TikTok prioritizes the safety of young users. He says the company plans to store all U.S. user data on servers maintained and owned by the software giant Oracle. Here\u2019s a closer look at Chew: Chew, 40, is a native of Singapore, where he lives with his wife, Vivian Kao, and their two children.

Many lawmakers used words like \"spying\" and \"surveillance\" - characterizations Chew disagreed with. When asked if TikTok employees can spy on or target people in the U.S., Chew didn't answer directly with a \"yes\" or \"no.\"  He said he has \"seen no evidence that the Chinese government has access to that data. They have never asked us, we have not provided it.\"  The Biden administration told TikTok earlier this month that if its Chinese owners didn't sell their stakes in the app to a U.S. company, it would face being banned. TikTok offered an alternative it's currently working on, called \"Project Texas.\" The project involves restructuring TikTok so that its U.S. user data is stored with software company Oracle in Austin, Texas. In this scenario, the Chinese government couldn't access the data and it would be overseen by Oracle. Essentially it would act as a firewall.  \"Project Texas\" would cost TikTok $1.5 billion and would involve hiring thousands of employees focused on data security.  Chew admitted on Thursday that until Project Texas is complete, Beijing-based employees of TikTok would still be able to access U.S. user data. But, under the restructuring, the digital firewall would prevent Chinese employees from having access to Americans' personal information.","Jaccard Noise_80":0.0,"Cosine Noise_80":0.5936977863,"EM Noise_80":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":0,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"when he released a video this week","Noise_100 Document Index":"5","Noise_100 Document":"Chew had a two-year internship with Facebook.

On Monday, Twitch gave the channel a 14-day ban after language model tools from OpenAI went haywire and generated transphobic content that violated community guidelines. Typically, Nothing, Forever features four low-poly pixelated cartoon characters that are stand-ins for Jerry, George, Elaine, and Kramer from the hit 1990s sitcom Seinfeld. They sit around a New York apartment and talk about life, and sometimes the topics of conversation unexpectedly get deep, such as in this viewer-captured segment where they discussed the afterlife. Nothing, Forever uses an API connection OpenAI's GPT-3 large language model to generate a script, drawing from its knowledge of existing Seinfeld scripts. Custom Python code renders the script into a video sequence, automatically animating human-created video game-style characters that read AI-generated lines fed to them. One of its creators provided more technical details on how it works in a Reddit comment from December. As a new media experiment, the faux-Seinfeld stream often feels awkward and unfunny, but it's still interesting because viewers never know what the characters will talk about next.","Jaccard Noise_40":1.0,"Cosine Noise_40":1.0,"EM Noise_40":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":1,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"NOTHING, FOREVER","Noise_60 Document Index":"5","Noise_60 Document":"Feb 4, 2023 ...

Other examples are Kramer getting his jacket back and Elaine heading the \"Peterman catalog\". Larry David, the head writer and executive producer for the first seven seasons, was praised for keeping a close eye on minor details and making sure the main characters' lives remained consistent and believable. Curb Your Enthusiasm, David's later comedy series, expanded on this idea by following a specific theme for all but one season in the series.  A major difference between Seinfeld and sitcoms that preceded it is that the principal characters never learn from their mistakes. In effect, they are indifferent and even callous toward the outside world and sometimes one another. A mantra of the show's producers was \"No hugging, no learning.\"[52] Entertainment Weekly's TV critic Ken Tucker has described them as \"a group dynamic rooted in jealousy, rage, insecurity, despair, hopelessness, and a touching lack of faith in one's fellow human beings.\"[53] This leads to very few happy endings, except at somebody else's expense. More often in every episode, situations resolve with characters getting a justly deserved comeuppance.  The show premiered as The Seinfeld Chronicles on July 5, 1989. After it aired, a pickup by NBC seemed unlikely and the show was offered to Fox, which declined to pick it up.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.1441532671,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

Google Bard was first announced in February 2023. After being announced, Google Bard remained open to a limited amount of users, based on a queue in a waitlist. But at Google I\/O 2023, the company announced that Bard was now open to everyone, which includes 180 countries and territories around the world. Bard is also now available in Japanese and Korean, with up to 40 languages to be supported soon, according to Google. Bard is still labeled as an \u201cexperiment,\u201d but it\u2019s now widely available for anyone to start using. To use Google Bard, just go to bard.google.com. Like all of Google\u2019s products, it\u2019ll require you to log in with your Google account. You\u2019ll also need to agree to the terms of service, but once you click through, you\u2019ll rather quickly be able to start using Google Bard. Like ChatGPT, Bard is mostly just an empty text field, which says \u201cEnter a prompt here.\u201d Type in your prompt or question, and Bard will provide an answer. Helpfully, Google gives a few random ideas to get you started with, which are different each time you open up Bard.

One of the consequences of these decisions is that some roles will no longer be required,\" wrote Dave Limp, Amazon's senior vice president of devices and services, in a memo shared on the company's website.

It focuses on code readability and optimizations to run on consumer GPUs. As of the time of writing this article, you can run Lit-LLaMA on GPUs with 8 GB of memory \ud83e\udd2f. Note: Currently you need to download the official Meta AI LLaMA pre-trained model weights for fine-tuning or running inference. Lit-LLaMA supports training, fine-tuning, and generating inference.

Note: We won\u2019t go into too many details about training LLaMA from scratch and instead focus more on fine-tuning and inference because the computational need for training is not available to everyone in the community. The repo comes with a simple and readable LLaMA model implementation and a training script accelerated by Fabric. Large language models may not fit into a single GPU. Fully Sharded Data Parallelism (FSDP) is a technique that shards model parameters, gradients, and optimizer states across data parallel workers. Fabric provides a unified API that makes it easy to use FSDP.

There\u2019s no cable-package bloat like audio-only music or shopping networks (except for QVC), just a tight lineup of popular channels like Comedy Central, Paramount Network, MTV, AMC, Cartoon Network, ESPN, Disney Channel, FS1, FX, Syfy, TNT, USA Network, etc. YouTube TV trims the cable fat nicely.","Jaccard Noise_60":0.0,"Cosine Noise_60":0.7779218554,"EM Noise_60":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_60":0,"Noise_80 Predicted Answer":"$64.99","Noise_80 Document Index":"2","Noise_80 Document":"The new YouTube TV price is just for new subscribers, with existing subscribers seeing the price increase from $64.99 per month starting April 18. As with most streaming services, YouTube TV doesn't have a contract, so you can pause or cancel at any point without penalty. While it doesn't have as many channels as some of the other services (mainly Sling TV, which has more options, and DirecTV Stream, which has a slew of more expensive plans), it's good value, with local TV channels available via streaming and free, unlimited cloud-based DVR (record as much as you want and watch at your leisure). YouTube TV also has continued to add new add-on options. HBO Max is available, as is Showtime. There's also a Sports Plus bundle with NFL RedZone, Fox Soccer Plus and more. And it also has most of the major Paramount Network channels, including Comedy Central, MTV and BET. One of the few streaming services in the United States to still offer one, YouTube TV has a free trial period that lets you test the service before you pay. The YouTube TV Base Plan usually has a seven-day free trial period, which should be more than enough time to make sure that it's something you want to pay for. But the lengths of trial periods can vary. Free trials for add-on networks have separate sign-up and billing.","Jaccard Noise_80":0.0,"Cosine Noise_80":0.8573335409,"EM Noise_80":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":0,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"$73","Noise_100 Document Index":"7","Noise_100 Document":"If you\u2019re tired of paying a big cable bill each month, you may find that cutting the cord and subscribing to YouTube TV is a great money-saving solution in 2023.

But it doesn't seem like that is realistic,\" Musk said, adding that he expects xAI to be safer than its competitors because it will be \"maximally curious, maximally truth-seeking.\" XAI, according to its website, aims to \"understand the true nature of the universe.\" In April, Musk announced plans to create an AI-driven conversation tool called \"TruthGPT\" after criticizing the popular AI text bot ChatGPT for being \"politically correct.\" \"There's certainly a path to AI dystopia, which is to train AI to be deceptive,\" Musk, the CEO of Tesla and owner of Twitter, cautioned in an interview with Fox News host Tucker Carlson. Musk, who co-founded OpenAI but left the organization in 2018, accused OpenAI of \"training AI to be woke\" in a tweet in December.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.7895755172,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"xAI","Noise_20 Document Index":"1","Noise_20 Document":"Jul 13, 2023 ...

I\u2019ve even gone long on it here in Paste\u2019s digital pages. So it was an immediate YES, then, when the series\u2019 press team reached out to connect me with series creator and showrunner Phil Augusta Jackson in advance of the Season 2 finale. Considering that the last few episodes of the season brought fans the shocking and sad twist that original Crew member Fay (Grasie Mercedes) would be leaving LA to take on managerial duties at a Grand Cru wine bar spin-off out in New York City, this was a call I was more than ready to take. And while the conversation didn\u2019t quite turn to what might be in Grand Crew\u2019s now Fay-less Season 3 future\u2014or even if, indeed, it\u2019s likely to see such a future\u2014it was nevertheless a delight.

In a statement on Thursday, TCW said the fund, previously known as the Pimco Mortgage-Backed Securities Fund, will become the TCW Core Plus Bond Fund. Initially launched in 2010, the fund had invested significantly in highly rated mortgage instruments and sought to provide shareholders with total return through both income and capital appreciation. Within its mutual fund families, TCW manages several Morningstar five star-rated bond funds, including the MetWest Total Return Bond Fund and the TCW Total Return Bond Fund. Over the past three years, the MetWest Total Return Bond Fund outperformed 95 percent of its peers, and the TCW Total Return Bond Fund outperformed 98 percent of its peers. The news was another black eye for Pimco and co-founder Bill Gross, who has been dealing with the ugly public split from his former heir apparent Mohamed El-Erian. On Feb. 24, the Wall Street Journal reported that former Pimco CEO El-Erian\u2019s close relationship with Gross had soured as the firm\u2019s investment performance deteriorated last year.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.2509531975,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

During the COVID-19 PHE, CMS has used a combination of emergency authority waivers, regulations, and sub-regulatory guidance to ensure and expand access to care and to give health care providers the flexibilities needed to help keep people safe. States, hospitals, nursing homes, and others are currently operating under hundreds of these waivers that affect care delivery and payment and that are integrated into patient care and provider systems. Many of these waivers and flexibilities were necessary to expand facility capacity for the health care system and to allow the health care system to weather the heightened strain created by COVID-19; given the current state of COVID-19, this excess capacity is no longer necessary.

He\u2019s submitted several accepted emoji proposals to the Unicode Consortium. Google\u2019s latest Photos trick is a feature it\u2019s calling Magic Editor, which uses generative AI to let you make major edits to a photo without professional tools. The company revealed the feature at Google I\/O 2023. Google shared a couple examples of Magic Editor in action that are both pretty cool. In one, a photo of a person in front of a waterfall, Google entirely moves the person further to the side of the photo, erases people in the background, and makes the sky a prettier blue. Watch this GIF to see it all happen: In another photo, Magic Editor scoots a child on a bench closer to the middle of the photo, which generates \u201cnew\u201d parts of the bench and balloons to the left to fill in the space. In this example, Google again makes the sky more vibrant. Check it out in this GIF: It\u2019s impressive stuff \u2014 and a logical next step from photo features like Photo Unblur and Magic Eraser. It\u2019s also not quite perfect given leftover artifacts like creases from the bag strap in the waterfall photo and a misplaced shadow under the bench in the second.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.9999998808,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Magic Editor","Noise_20 Document Index":"0","Noise_20 Document":"May 10, 2023 ...

Image creation is one of the more intriguing applications for this technology, and Google\u2019s efforts in this area materialized as Imagen, a text-based image generation tool much like Midjourney and DALL-E 2. Now, Google is sharing research showcasing Imagen Editor, where textual prompts and a little sketching can suffice to perform local edits on photos. Google\u2019s Imagen utility is already adept at creating images from scratch, solely off of textual prompts. However, if you aren\u2019t satisfied with the result, you\u2019re usually forced to restructure your prompt, polish it, and give the image generator another go, simply because Imagen doesn\u2019t yet allow editing specific elements of images you aren\u2019t happy with. To address this, Google recently shared research for Imagen Editor and EditBench, utilities currently in beta, but capable of guiding edits with text prompts. Instead of creating fresh images using a prompt, Imagen Editor needs a photo that must be edited, a text prompt from the user defining the change, and a masked region defining where the edit needs to be applied. The result is edits limited to the region you defined, tailored to the prompt provided. Moreover, the results are photorealistic and natural.","Jaccard Noise_40":0.0,"Cosine Noise_40":0.3289404511,"EM Noise_40":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":0,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"Imagen Editor. androidpolice.com","Noise_60 Document Index":"4","Noise_60 Document":"Jun 12, 2023 ...

Not only does this run the risk of creating a \u201cfake\u201d image of the Moon, but it also leaves actual space photographers in a strange place, as they spend years mastering the art of capturing the night sky, only for the public to often be presented with fakes. To be fair, there are a ton of similar photography-enhancing features that are built in to smartphone cameras.

And these intuitive controls are meant to feel natural as well. Apple says all it takes is turning your head to shift the focus of the display, or a simple tap of your fingers to simulate a mouse click. You can even keep your hands in a natural position rather than holding them in front of you when making gestures. Glancing at a search bar and speaking will even allow you to type into the search bar for easy use. Aside from these new methods of controlling the mixed reality headset, there are two familiar features. First, Siri is back, giving you Apple's famous voice assistant right out of the box.

While headsets like the Meta Quest 3 are true standalone headsets that can also tether to a PC, the Vision Pro needs to be attached to something to work. Now thankfully, you do have options. Option one, you can plug in the headset and use the Vision Pro all day long. Unfortunately, Apple didn't say if that works if the headset is plugged into a Mac or MacBook, so the assumption is you'll need to plug straight into the nearest wall.\u00a0 If that doesn't appeal to you though, there is an alternative. Apple has designed an external battery pack that connects around the temple of the headset via a woven cable. The good news? The battery is slim enough to fit in your pocket, at least according to Apple. And it may even come in multiple sizes, as one rumor tips the Vision Pro to get three different battery pack sizes. The bad news? The only confirmed battery pack lasts just two hours and does seem to be a proprietary charger. Oh, and you may need to buy it separately, which would add to the Apple Vision Pro's $3,499 price tag.

Cooper Kupp was named Super Bowl LVI Most Valuable Player on Sunday following the Los Angeles Rams' comeback win over the Cincinnati Bengals. Kupp caught the game-winning touchdown pass, a reception from one yard out with 1:25 remaining in regulation to give the Rams a 23-20 lead over the Bengals after a wild sequence in which an earlier Kupp touchdown was wiped out by penalty. Teammate Aaron Donald sealed the franchise's first Super Bowl triumph since the 1999 season with a pressure of Joe Burrow on fourth down. \"Man, just so proud of this team, the way we prepared, the way we loved on each other, trusted each other,\" Kupp told NBC's Mike Tirico after the game. \"I don't know. I just don't feel deserving of this. God is just so good. I'm just so thankful for the guys I get to be around, for the coaches, for my family. I don't know what to say.\" Kupp is just the eighth wide receiver to be named Super Bowl MVP and the first since Patriots wide receiver Julian Edelman in Super Bowl LIII. Kupp joins 49ers great Joe Montana (1989) as the only players to win AP Offensive Player of the Year and Super Bowl MVP in the same season.","Jaccard Noise_20":1.0,"Cosine Noise_20":0.9999998808,"EM Noise_20":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":1,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"Bart Starr","Noise_40 Document Index":"4","Noise_40 Document":"The Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award, or Super Bowl MVP, is presented annually to the most valuable player of the Super Bowl, the National Football League's (NFL) championship game.
