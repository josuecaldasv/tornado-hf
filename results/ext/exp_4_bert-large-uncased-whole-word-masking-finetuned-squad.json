And this was just for a hockey barn full of randos in Pittsburgh. So Just Call Out My Name, a slick production that teeters precariously close to purely promotional material, is simply a celebration of these songs, captured in the digital amber of 2010 for us to appreciate in 2022. If you want a detailed timeline of Taylor and King\u2019s professional endeavors, go read Wikipedia, I guess. The emotion they shared on stage in 1970 and again 40 years later was true, and the songs never come off as products manufactured for mass consumption. And even if Marshall presents King and Taylor\u2019s relationship as little more than a Thing That Happened \u2013 with minimal detail and no mention of any conflict ever \u2013 the film implies that the songs tell the story, and that the purity of their relationship manifested those songs for the world to enjoy.

It comes from in-house producer Jennie Snyder Urman, who created and executive produced Jane The Virgin. She currently serves as executive producer on the CW\u2019s Charmed and CBS\u2019s midseason sitcom Broke. The writer is Katie Wech, who previously worked with Urman as co-executive producer on Jane the Virgin. Prior to Good Sam, she wrote ABC's pilot The Hypnotist\u2019s Love Story, based on the Liane Moriarty book, which didn't make it to series for good reasons (read my script review). Most recently, she was one of the many writers hired for Fox\u2019s summer series BH90210. This is also the second year CBS has developed a drama pilot for Sophia Bush. In 2019, she headlined Surveillance, a suspenseful spy thriller (read my preview) which reportedly \"tested through the roof\" but was ultimately determined not to be a good fit for the network.

Something had to be done about Georgia Tech\u2019s punt protection. The Yellow Jackets had four punts blocked in their first four games. A block two days earlier at UCF had been returned for a touchdown and erased a Georgia Tech lead just before halftime. Clemson had blocked two punts in the season opener.

After Jerrod Carmichael explained to the audience at the Beverly Hilton how he wound up as the host (spoiler: \"I'm here because I'm Black,\" he quipped before launching into a detailed and honest account of his decision-making process), the trophy distribution began. The Banshees of Inisherin, which led all movies with eight nominations, struck up a meaningful friendship with Globes voters over the evening: The Irish-island-set tragicomedy took home the best comedy film trophy, while Colin Farrell triumphed in the acting category and writer-director Martin McDonagh won for best screenplay. The Fablemans also came into frame by winning best drama film honors and best director (Steven Spielberg). Meanwhile, Everything Everywhere All at Once prevailed in two dimensions, as Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan netted acting trophies.","Jaccard Noise_20":0.0,"Cosine Noise_20":0.3018239439,"EM Noise_20":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":0,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"West Side Story","Noise_40 Document Index":"1","Noise_40 Document":"Best Performance By An Actress In A Motion Picture \u2013 Musical Or Comedy Marion Cotillard, Annette Alana Haim, Licorice Pizza Jennifer Lawrence, Don\u2019t Look Up Emma Stone, Cruella Rachel Zegler, West Side Story \u2013 WINNER 6.

The Bengals will face the Rams for the game, and a rap performance featuring Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Mary J. Blige and Kendrick Lamar will take place during the halftime show. But, in between all of the action, there will be a long list of new, and possibly iconic, Super Bowl commercials. In order to get your company a spot during the Super Bowl commercials, you must pay a pretty penny. Here's what you need to know about how much Super Bowl commercials cost.

This year's price is the most expensive Super Bowl ad price in NFL history. This price is about a 20 percent increase from the last time NBC hosted the Super Bowl in 2018.

The AI Research SuperCluster (RSC) will feature 16,000 Nvidia A100 GPUs and is set for completion in the middle of 2022. The company has already started using the hardware to train large computer vision and natural language processing (NLP) models. \u201cThe experiences we're building for the metaverse require enormous compute power (quintillions of operations \/ second!) and RSC will enable new AI models that can learn from trillions of examples, understand hundreds of languages, and more,\" said Mark Zuckerberg, chairman, CEO and controlling shareholder of the company. Unlike Meta\u2019s previous AI supercomputer launched in 2017, the RSC will be capable of training machine learning models on real-world data sourced from the company\u2019s social media platforms.

Our researchers have already started using RSC to train large models in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision for research, with the aim of one day training models with trillions of parameters. RSC will help Meta\u2019s AI researchers build new and better AI models that can learn from trillions of examples; work across hundreds of different languages; seamlessly analyze text, images, and video together; develop new augmented reality tools; and much more. Our researchers will be able to train the largest models needed to develop advanced AI for computer vision, NLP, speech recognition, and more. We hope RSC will help us build entirely new AI systems that can, for example, power real-time voice translations to large groups of people, each speaking a different language, so they can seamlessly collaborate on a research project or play an AR game together. Ultimately, the work done with RSC will pave the way toward building technologies for the next major computing platform \u2014 the metaverse, where AI-driven applications and products will play an important role.","Jaccard Noise_20":1.0,"Cosine Noise_20":0.2727876604,"EM Noise_20":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":1,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"AI Research","Noise_40 Document Index":"1","Noise_40 Document":"Jan 26, 2022 ...

In the first half, the Bengals were mostly able to control the rush with an efficient run game, Joe Burrow quickly getting rid of the ball and a commitment to turning their protection toward Aaron Donald as much as possible. In the first half, the Rams had seven pressures, but Burrow was sacked only once. Then Rams defensive coordinator Raheem Morris adjusted and the much-talked-about mismatch materialized. In the second half, the Rams had 11 pressures and six sacks.  Morris\u2019 adjustment was simple: He started blitzing as he had throughout the playoffs. Bringing five rushers created one-on-ones for the Rams\u2019 pass rushers and clogged up running lanes for Burrow, who won previous playoff games with his ability to get away from pressure.  In the wild-card round, the Rams had a lot of success with bringing five rushers to pressure and containing Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.3986084461,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

Check out some fun facts about the cast. The 2022 film The Lost City is the perfect combination of comedy, adventure, romance, and an incredibly talented cast capable of pulling off any role. This film directed by Adam and Aaron Nee, from a story by Seth Gordon, features Loretta Sage, a brilliant author who writes romance novels set in exotic locations featuring Dr. Angela Lovemore and her romantic interest, Dash McMahon. But Loretta's real life bears no resemblance to the things she writes: after her husband's death, she became a reclusive, grumpy woman who is not even eager to write anymore. Halfway through a promotional tour for her latest novel, Loretta is kidnapped by a lunatic billionaire who wants her to lead him to a lost city treasure she depicted in her book. Fortunately, Loretta won't be alone: Alan, the cover model of her books, sets out on a journey to rescue her and demonstrate that he can also be a hero. Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum headline this blockbuster alongside Daniel Radcliffe, Da'Vine Joy Randolph, Brad Pitt, and Oscar Nunez, among other actors.

In October 2020, it was announced Sandra Bullock would star in the film The Lost City of D, with Aaron and Adam Nee directing from a screenplay by Seth Gordon and Dana Fox, with Bullock serving as a producer under her Fortis Films banner, and Paramount Pictures to distribute.[8] Bullock originally passed on the project because she felt the story was \"outdated\" due to it being in development for seven years.[9] That December, Channing Tatum was cast as the male lead.[10] Between March and April 2021, Patti Harrison, Da'Vine Joy Randolph, Daniel Radcliffe, Brad Pitt, and Oscar Nunez joined the cast, with Pitt and Lang appearing in cameo roles.[11][12][13][14][15]  Principal photography began in May 2021[16] in the Dominican Republic, including Saman\u00e1, Santo Domingo, Casa de Campo, Monte Plata Province and Pinewood Dominican Republic Studios.","Jaccard Noise_20":1.0,"Cosine Noise_20":1.0,"EM Noise_20":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":1,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"Oscar Nunez","Noise_40 Document Index":"0","Noise_40 Document":"However, contrary to what many people think, Harry Potter was not the first role played by Radcliffe: his film debut was indeed in 2001, but not in the saga that made him world-famous, but in John Boorman's film The Tailor of Panama, co-starring alongside Pierce Brosnan, Geoffrey Rush, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Brendan Gleeson.

This is significant because the M2 is an evolution of the remarkable M1 chip that debuted in 2020, and it powers Apple's new 13-inch MacBook Air 2022 and MacBook Pro 2022. These are successors to two of the best MacBooks on the market, so it's exciting to see what an M2 injection can do. The new Apple M2 chip debuted in two new laptops: the 13-inch MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, which launched in the Summer of 2022. The M2 chip is available in either the 13-inch MacBook Air 2022 (starting price: $1,199) or the MacBook Pro 2022 ($1,299), so you'll need to pay over $1k to get yourself an M2-powered MacBook.

When Apple added the M2 Pro and M2 Max processors to MacBook Pro and Mac mini in January 2023, it also bumped pricing for the existing iMacs in countries outside the U.S. For example, in the U.K., each iMac model now costs \u00a3150 more even though it hasn\u2019t been updated.\u00a0 Since Apple has adjusted prices in line with exchange rate fluctuations we don\u2019t expect the pricing to increase again.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.5499382019,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

It's all part of the chaotic saga that began this spring, when Musk first put in motion a plan to take control of the social media platform.  Here\u2019s a complete timeline of what\u2019s happened so far. On April 5, Musk discloses he has purchased more than 9% of Twitter's shares on the open market. At first, he is offered a board seat. That plan quickly falls through \u2014\u00a0and Twitter decides to adopt a poison-pill strategy to fend off a hostile takeover from Musk. Musk subsequently makes an offer to buy Twitter for $54.20 a share, or about $44 billion \u2014 a price well above the company's stock price at the time. He says his goal is to apply free speech principles to the platform, which he claimed had been mismanaged.\u00a0\"The company will neither thrive nor serve this societal imperative in its current form,\" he writes. \"Twitter needs to be transformed as a private company.\" \"Twitter has extraordinary potential. I will unlock it,\" he adds. Musk says he would fund the deal through a combination of cash and borrowing.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":1.0,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Elon Musk","Noise_20 Document Index":"5","Noise_20 Document":"Markets     Fear & Greed Index                  Latest Market News            Elon Musk has completed his $44 billion acquisition of Twitter, the company confirmed in","Jaccard Noise_20":1.0,"Cosine Noise_20":1.0,"EM Noise_20":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":1,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"Elon Musk","Noise_40 Document Index":"8","Noise_40 Document":"Nov 11, 2022 ...

In April, he struck the deal to buy the company for $44 billion and said he would lift Twitter\u2019s content moderation policies, eliminate spam, add new features and provide more transparency about the algorithms used to promote content. \u201cTwitter has tremendous potential \u2014 I look forward to working with the company and the community of users to unlock it,\u201d he said in a statement in April. But, within weeks, he began questioning the deal. Mr. Musk lashed out at the Twitter executives responsible for content decisions and accused the company of failing to accurately count the spam accounts on its platform. When Parag Agrawal, Twitter\u2019s chief executive, tried debunking Mr. Musk\u2019s claims, Mr. Musk responded by tweeting a poop emoji. By July, Mr. Musk had decided that he no longer wanted to own Twitter, arguing that he had been misled about the amount of spam on the platform. He announced his intent to abandon the acquisition. Twitter sued Mr. Musk to force him to carry out the agreement. The company accused Mr. Musk of trying to back out of the deal because the economic downturn had caused a decline in his personal wealth.

Few people gave Ruud, the fourth seed, much of a realistic chance against the third seed Djokovic, but after contesting the French and US Open finals last season against Nadal and Carlos Alcaraz, Ruud knew what level it would take for him to match Djokovic in a grand slam final. Ruud started the match vaporising his forehand as he took an early break, while Djokovic started the match poorly. He played passively while he sprayed forehands and missed overheads. The benefit of being Djokovic, though, is that he always has options. He dug in and he relied on his legs as he soaked up a series of stinging Ruud forehands before retrieving the early break. Still, the Norwegian kept his head up.

Clippy was a (now) comical disaster: in trying to be smart, it was overly invasive in its suggestions. It would make erroneous assumptions, interpreting both the wrong inputs and outputting bad corrections. If your camera does this, you will get images that are unlike what you saw and what you wanted to capture. Good processing, on the other hand, is magic. Examples include night mode, which is the heaviest processing of images that your iPhone can do to achieve what you can easily see with the naked eye: a dimly lit scene. Tiny cameras with small lenses simply do not capture enough light to capture this, and \u2018stitching\u2019 together many shots taken in quick succession, stabilizing them in 3D space, and even using machine learning to guess their color allows for a magical experience.  iPhone 14 Pro vastly improves on iPhone 13 Pro in this department by having a far higher success rate in its processing decisions.  There\u2019s still times where iPhone 14 Pro misses, but at a much lower rate than the iPhone 13 Pro and preceding iPhones. If you\u2019re like me, and prefer to skip most of this processing, there\u2019s some good news. Of note is that the 48 megapixel images coming out of the iPhone 14 Pro exhibit considerably less \u2018heavy handed\u2019 processing than the 12 megapixel shots.","Jaccard Noise_20":1.0,"Cosine Noise_20":1.0,"EM Noise_20":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":1,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"48","Noise_40 Document Index":"4","Noise_40 Document":"Well ahead of Apple\u2019s event last month, there had been rumors that this long era \u2014\u00a07 years is a practical century in technology time \u2014 was about to come to an end.

Here\u2019s how it works. Here's how 48MP ProRAW images compare to 12MP shots The iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max have some major camera advantages over the regular iPhone 14, such as a 3x telephoto zoom lens. But a new exclusive feature for this year is a 48MP sensor for the main wide camera in the Pro models. And based on my testing, it produces some pretty amazing results.\u00a0 The new 48MP sensor on the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max is 65% larger than the one on the iPhone 13 Pro, and it features a second-gen sensor-shift optical image stabilization system. The main camera\u2019s sensor can optimize for light capture and group every four pixels into a larger quad-pixel (resulting in 12MP shots) or use each pixel individually to optimize for detail in higher-resolution 48MP pics.\u00a0 It\u2019s the latter scenario that I was interested in for this comparison, which shows what happens when you use the ProRAW format and shoot full 48MP photos. We've also made a video showcasing the differences between ProRAW and regular mode. The beauty of shooting 48MP images is that you have a lot more pixels to play with, especially if you want to crop, reframe or zoom in.","Jaccard Noise_60":0.0,"Cosine Noise_60":0.8186799884,"EM Noise_60":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_60":0,"Noise_80 Predicted Answer":"2-megapixel","Noise_80 Document Index":"5","Noise_80 Document":"Lux  When the iPhone was first introduced, it packed in quite a few innovations.

A major change in PvP modes was to reduce team sizes from six to five. Several major characters were also reworked. Overwatch 2 is free-to-play on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X\/S in early access on October 4 and features full cross-platform play.  Overwatch 2 is a hero shooter, where players are split into two teams and select a \"hero\" from a roster of 35 characters. Characters are organized into a \"damage\" class, responsible for offensive efforts; a \"support\" class, responsible for healing and buffing; and a \"tank\" class, responsible for creating space for their team. Each character has a unique set of skills, made up of active, passive, and ultimate abilities. Overwatch 2, like its predecessor, primarily centers on player versus player (PvP) combat across several different modes and maps, and includes both casual and ranked competitive matches.

The development team wanted to develop a story-driven game in the style of the first two entries in the series, while featuring content and combat from previous Xeno entries. The gameplay combines elements from the first and second entries. Like the first two entries, the game was localized by Nintendo of Europe.    Xenoblade Chronicles 3 takes place in Aionios, where two warring nations, Keves and Agnus, engage in perpetual war fought by soldiers with ten-year lifespans.  The story follows Noah and his two childhood friends, Eunie and Lanz, who are from Keves, and Mio and her two fellow servicemen, Sena and Taion, who are from Agnus.

The ensemble cast features Rob Brown, Channing Tatum, Debbi Morgan, Robert Ri'chard and singer Ashanti.  The film was a co-production between the motion picture studios of MTV Films and Tollin\/Robbins Productions. Theatrically and for the home video rental market, it was commercially distributed by Paramount Pictures. The film explores professional ethics, academics and athletics.[5] The sports action in the film was coordinated by Mark Ellis. On January 11, the film's soundtrack was released by Capitol Records. The film's score was composed and orchestrated by musician Trevor Rabin.  Coach Carter was released in the United States on January 14, 2005. The film received generally positive reviews and went on to gross $76 million worldwide.  Ken Carter lives in Richmond, California.

With a premise similar to Hardcore Henry, Carter also features video game logic in its action sequences. Joo Won is a South Korean actor best known for his roles in television, including the main protagonist in Good Doctor, which is played by Freddie Highmore in the American adaptation.

Together, they delivered a thrilling competition mostly free of major errors from the best athletes. The margins at the top of the standings stayed tight throughout Friday evening at Amalie Arena, but Jones, a 20-year-old who has never competed at the world championships or the Olympics, emerged as the headliner.

Tesla is raising the price of its \"Full Self Driving\" software to $15,000, Elon Musk said in a tweet on Sunday. Tesla is facing scrutiny from federal and state officials over how it has advertised its self-driving technology, as well as concern over safety risks involved with the self-driving capability. Customers who order the Full Self Driving, or FSD, software before Sept. 5 will receive the product under the current price, Musk, Tesla's CEO, said in the tweet. The $3K price bump arrives as Tesla introduces FSD beta 10.69, a new iteration that boasts \"improved overall driving smoothness\" and \"reduced false slowdowns near crosswalks,\" according to the company. The FSD software doesn't make a car fully self-driving. Rather, users must remain focused on the road and keep their hands on the driving wheel. The Autopilot system, meanwhile, offers navigation to and from user-provided destinations, as well as suggestions for lane changes and other maneuvers to optimize a trip. Tesla has come under sharp criticism over its marketing of the FSD software and Autopilot. Earlier this month, the California Department of Motor Vehicles alleged that the company deceptively advertises the products as fully autonomous, according to two filings with California's Office of Administrative Hearings. The filings were first reported by The Los Angeles Times.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.6348752379,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":0,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"$15,000","Noise_20 Document Index":"8","Noise_20 Document":"By  Emma Roth, a news writer who covers the streaming wars, consumer tech, crypto, social media, and much more.

The price hike comes as Tesla begins rolling out FSD beta 10.69 to drivers, a version Musk calls \u201ca big step forward.\u201d It\u2019s still unclear whether Tesla plans on raising the price of its FSD subscription, which currently costs $199 per month. The FSD software lets drivers use Tesla\u2019s advanced driving assistance system (ADAS), Autopilot, to navigate to and from specific destinations, among other driver-assist features. FSD doesn\u2019t make a vehicle fully autonomous; it requires drivers to keep their hands on the wheel and pay attention to the road at all times. The price of Tesla\u2019s FSD beta has slowly crept up over the years, and cost $5,000 upon launch.","Jaccard Noise_20":1.0,"Cosine Noise_20":0.9999999404,"EM Noise_20":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":1,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"$15,000","Noise_40 Document Index":"7","Noise_40 Document":"Keiron Berndt | Capital One  Article QuickTakes: Tesla has raised the price of its\u00a0Full Self-Driving (FSD) feature set again, this time to $15,000. The increase follows several others, including one just months ago, when the cost rose from $10,000 to $12,000. This latest hike is tied to a software update (FSD Beta 10.69.2), which improves overall driving smoothness through turns, enhances pedestrian and animal detection, and enables a creep-into-intersection function. Full Self-Driving is Tesla\u2019s disingenuously named suite of advanced driver-assistance features. Currently, it includes all the functionality of Basic and Enhanced Autopilot, plus the ability to slow the vehicle to a stop as it approaches red traffic signals and signs. If you see little importance or utility in the last of those things, you can still get the bulk of Tesla\u2019s magic with Enhanced Autopilot. It costs a relative bargain, at $6,000, and gives your vehicle the ability to park itself and navigate a highway route from on-ramp to off-ramp (including automatic lane changes) with minimal driver involvement. It also includes Summon, which allows the driver to direct a car into or out of a tight parking space while standing outside the vehicle, and Smart Summon, which enables the vehicle to wind its way around objects (such as in a parking lot) to meet the driver.","Jaccard Noise_40":1.0,"Cosine Noise_40":0.9999999404,"EM Noise_40":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":1,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"$15,000","Noise_60 Document Index":"4","Noise_60 Document":"69, Tesla would increase the price of the package from $12,000 to $15,000.

Since Musk has made it clear that he believes true self-driving is worth a lot more than $15,000, he says that the price will keep going up leading to self-driving.

However, the feature hasn\u2019t lived up to its name so far. It has been in beta for two years now, and it is still far from self-driving. Technically, the system is able to both activate and attempt to drive in most areas, including across intersections, but the responsibility remains with the driver, who needs to be paying attention at all times and be ready to take control. Many see the willingness to take responsibility for the system as the most important step companies developing self-driving systems can take toward achieving this goal. Tesla has made it clear that it is not there yet and participating in the FSD Beta comes with a bunch of warnings that make it clear the responsibility is still with the driver. But Tesla sees every new FSD update as a step closer to the goal, and it believes that some of those updates even warrant price increases for the package.

The first proposed spin-off to Game Of Thrones \u2013 a Naomi Watts-led adventure set in Westeros\u2019 distant past \u2013 was ultimately scrapped, reportedly because it was too different from the original show.

The film was set to be directed by Gore Verbinski, director of the Pirates of the Caribbean series. However, it was announced on August 24, 2009 that because of budget issues, and the prospect of filming some footage overseas, Verbinski had dropped out as director.[1] Verbinski remained as the film's producer, and was working with the new director, Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, who is best known for his horror sequel 28 Weeks Later, to manage the film's budget. The pre-production on the BioShock film was cancelled sometime in late 2010 or early 2011.  In 2022 it was announced that the film was back in development and would be a Netflix exclusive film. That same year, the film found both it's director and writer in Francis Lawrence and Michael Green respectively.  In early July of 2010 Verbinski announced that he was still active on the film, and that he and Fresnadillo were working to reduce the budget and produce the film with an R-rating.[2]  In February 2011 Verbinski confirmed that pre-production on the BioShock film has stopped because no studio was willing to invest in such an expensive project with a violent theme.[3]","Jaccard Noise_40":0.0,"Cosine Noise_40":0.4128765166,"EM Noise_40":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":0,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"Francis Lawrence","Noise_60 Document Index":"5","Noise_60 Document":"Aug 26, 2022 ...

Then\u00a0\u2022 In 1978, I started on the weekend news at KTVI my freshman year at St. Louis University, where I majored in meteorology. For a couple of years in the early '80s I did the weekend weather alongside Christine Buck at KPLR. I stayed there until going back to weekends at KTVI when Ron Yaros was promoted to the weeknight broadcasts. Because I was working full-time while a full-time student, it took a few additional years to earn my bachelor\u2019s degree. But that extra time allowed me to hone on my broadcasting skills guided by the wonderful mentors who were on the weekends with me those last few years: Sports anchor Greg Gizinski and news anchors Al Ruechel and Donn Johnson. I also used the time to take a couple of graduate-level courses. In the fall of 1985, I left St. Louis for my first full-time, multi-year contract with KMBC in Kansas City.","Jaccard Noise_40":0.0,"Cosine Noise_40":0.3408093154,"EM Noise_40":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":0,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"John Fuller","Noise_60 Document Index":"5","Noise_60 Document":"FOX 2 Please enter a search term.

The Lincoln Police Department said officers were dispatched to a residence on a domestic disturbance call. After an investigation, officers arrested Joseph, 54, at a separate location and booked him into the Lancaster County Jail. Joseph was placed on administrative leave by Nebraska athletic director Trev Alberts following the arrest. Joseph was named interim coach after the Cornhuskers fired Scott Frost on Sept. 11. Nebraska went 3-6 under Joseph, finishing the season 4-8, before hiring former Carolina Panthers coach Matt Rhule to an eight-year deal as the program's new head coach on Saturday. At Rhule's introductory news conference Monday, he credited Joseph and Nebraska's staff for how they finished the season. Joseph's amended contract after he became interim head coach stated that he would return to his role as wide receivers coach, passing game coordinator and associate head coach if someone else was named the team's permanent coach. The contract stated Joseph would be owed his original buyout if not retained without cause. Rhule had not announced whether Joseph would be retained on his staff. Rhule declined comment to The Associated Press through an athletic department spokesman Wednesday night.

Authorities had allowed him to be detained at home in San Diego because he had suffered bouts of poor health in recent years, including kidney cancer.

At last year's event, Zuckerberg teased Project Nazare: Meta's first AR headset. The company only showed a brief simulation of what avatar holograms might look like through the AR headset. According to a roadmap leak, three generations of the AR headset were scheduled for 2024, 2026, and 2028. But in June, it was said that the first version would no longer be commercialized and would instead be distributed free of charge to developers. The market launch would only take place with the second version in 2026. At Meta Connect 2021, Meta simulated what augmented reality could look like with Project Nazare. | Image: Meta Although this makes commercialization a distant prospect, Meta should provide new insights into AR projects: In addition to Project Nazare, a pair of data glasses codenamed Hypernova is also in development, as is a new version of Ray-Ban Stories.","Jaccard Noise_40":0.0,"Cosine Noise_40":0.423370719,"EM Noise_40":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":0,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"October 11","Noise_60 Document Index":"6","Noise_60 Document":"Meta Connect 2022 kicks off on October 11.

The highlight of the conference is the keynote, where Mark Zuckerberg is anticipated to present Meta Quest Pro (info) and announce Meta's next metaverse projects. Immediately following, John Carmack is expected to stream live from Virtual Reality and give his (blunt) take on the State of Play. Hopefully with Meta Quest Pro, so you can read his facial expressions. Another important block is the Developer State of the Union, where Meta updates the audience on the state of the Quest ecosystem. The last figures are from February 2022. After the main event, the Developer Sessions go online. These pre-recorded videos feature talks from Meta developers and other industry representatives. The Meta Connect 2022 program has recently been listed on the official website including the Developer Sessions. These could give a glimpse of what the conference will focus on, as well as hint at what new features Meta has up its sleeve. At least three talks are dedicated to the Presence Platform, Meta's mixed reality interfaces. The platform should become even more important with high-quality passthrough on the Meta Quest Pro.

Meta faces a hefty GDPR fine for its handling of children's data. Meta is facing a fine of 405 million euros, or just over $400 million, from Ireland's Data Protection Commission for failing to safeguard children's information on Instagram.\u00a0 The country's data watchdog had accused Instagram of setting children's accounts to \"public\" by default and allowing children to operate business accounts on the platform, which could leave their phone numbers and email addresses exposed. Full details of the decision are expected to be published next week, a commission spokesman said Tuesday.\u00a0 Meta confirmed the fine and said it plans to appeal the decision.\u00a0 \"This inquiry focused on old settings that we updated over a year ago, and we've since released many new features to help keep teens safe and their information private,\" a Meta spokesperson told CNET via email on Tuesday. \"Anyone under 18 automatically has their account set to private when they join Instagram, so only people they know can see what they post, and adults can't message teens who don't follow them.\"\u00a0 The spokesperson added that Meta disagrees with how the fine was calculated and is reviewing the rest of the commission's decision. The $400 million fine would be the second-largest issued to a tech company for a violation of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, behind Amazon's record-setting $888 million fine in 2021.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.25,"Cosine Noise_0":0.7605696917,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":0,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"\u00a327m","Noise_20 Document Index":"7","Noise_20 Document":"Investigation finds video-sharing app may have breached UK data protection law between 2018 and 2020 TikTok is facing the prospect of a \u00a327m fine for failing to protect the privacy of children, the UK\u2019s data watchdog has said.

The country home is not just known amongst royalty, though. It is also recognized by high-level English politicians, who have described the location as being more than just a centuries-old castle.   \"[Balmoral Castle is] a vivid combination of the intriguing, the surreal and the utterly freaky,\" former U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair has said about the estate, per The Guardian in September 2016.

The synopsis that Fox provides is tantalizing: Reigning King of Country Music Albie Roman, along with his insanely talented -- and tough as nails -- wife, Queen of Country Music Dottie Cantrell Roman, have created a country music dynasty, but even though the Roman name is synonymous with authenticity, the very foundation of their success is a lie. When their reign as country royalty is put in jeopardy, heir to the crown Nicolette \u201cNicky\u201d Roman will stop at nothing to protect her family\u2019s legacy, while ensuring her own quest for stardom, alongside her brother Luke and sister Gigi. The trailer very much confirms the synopsis. With characters oozing secrets, betrayals, fistfights, guns, bright lights, and country music, there\u2019s enough content here for a whole album\u2019s worth of country music lyrics. Importantly, we are introduced to the major players in the series, most of them members of the Roman family. Created by Melissa London Hilfers, the series promises an epic drama with familiar actors and names from the country music scene including starring roles from Susan Sarandon and country singer Trace Adkins.","Jaccard Noise_20":0.0,"Cosine Noise_20":0.1439207643,"EM Noise_20":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":0,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"Albie Roman","Noise_40 Document Index":"4","Noise_40 Document":"Share MONARCH: Trace Adkins in the series premiere of Monarch airing in Fall 2022 on FOX.

The news punctuates an eventful and \u201cstressful\u201d regular season for Busch, whose free agency dominated headlines and clouded a playoff-caliber season in 2022. It did so because his looming free agency revealed a strange reality in NASCAR economics \u2014 that one of the sport\u2019s biggest stars would have to struggle to find a home (even with taking a pay cut) because of something outside of his control. That \u201csomething\u201d outside of his control, in this case, was the result of the Mars Inc. decision to exit NASCAR at the end of the year, leaving Joe Gibbs Racing (Busch\u2019s current team) without a primary sponsor for Busch\u2019s No. 18 team. Busch confirmed to reporters earlier this month that he had \u201cmore than one\u201d team extend official contract offers to him. RCR was among those companies, per reports at the time.

The two-time Nascar Cup Series champion is officially a driver for Richard Childress Racing, as he will take over the No. 8 Chevrolet in 2023.

Two championships and dozens of wins later, Busch was waiting for JGR to sign a new primary sponsor and then have a contract extension of his own.

Titus Welliver also has a history with several comic book adaptations and properties, including a role in the movie Red 2 (a sequel to a film based on a Warren Ellis graphic novel). He also played S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent Felix Black in the Marvel Studios short film Item 47, which was in many ways the precursor to the show Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

It is the best-selling Zelda game and one of the best-selling video games of all time, with 32.35 million copies sold by 2023.  Breath of the Wild is considered one of the greatest video games of all time. Journalists described it as a landmark in open-world design for its emphasis on experimentation, physics-based sandbox, and emergent gameplay. Numerous developers cited Breath of the Wild as inspiration, and it is a popular point of comparison among open-world games. A spin-off, Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity, was released in 2020 while a sequel, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, was released in 2023.  Breath of the Wild is an open world action-adventure game. Players are tasked with exploring the kingdom of Hyrule while controlling Link. Breath of the Wild encourages nonlinear gameplay, which is illustrated by the game's lack of defined entrances or exits to areas,[1] scant instruction given to the player, and encouragement to explore freely.[2] Breath of the Wild introduces a consistent physics engine to the Zelda series, letting players approach problems in different ways rather than trying to find a single solution.[3] The game also integrates a \"chemistry engine\" that defines the physical properties of most objects and governs how they interact with the player and one another.","Jaccard Noise_40":1.0,"Cosine Noise_40":1.0,"EM Noise_40":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":1,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"Tears of the Kingdom","Noise_60 Document Index":"4","Noise_60 Document":"While Nintendo has rarely released direct sequels to Zelda games in the past, Aonuma previously explained that the impetus behind Tears of the Kingdom is the wealth of ideas the development team came up with when making DLC for the first game. \"When we released the DLC for Breath of the Wild, we realized that this is a great way to add more elements to the same world,\" Aonuma said. \"But when it comes down to technical things, DLC is pretty much data -- you're adding data to a preexisting title. And so when we wanted to add bigger changes, DLC is not enough, and that's why we thought maybe a sequel would be a good fit.\"\u00a0 The original Breath of the Wild launched alongside the Nintendo Switch in March 2017, and it would go on to become one of the most critically and commercially successful games in the franchise, selling more than 26 million copies.","Jaccard Noise_60":1.0,"Cosine Noise_60":1.0,"EM Noise_60":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_60":1,"Noise_80 Predicted Answer":"Breath of the Wild 2","Noise_80 Document Index":"2","Noise_80 Document":"As with all leaks, speculations and rumors surrounding the Breath of the Wild sequel, everything must be taken with a pinch (or maybe even a fistful) of salt until something is officially announced by Nintendo itself. This year does mark the 35th Anniversary of the Legend of Zelda series, so hopefully some new information will come to light soon about how Nintendo plans to celebrate this momentous occasion. Last year was the 35th Anniversary of the Super Mario franchise, which was acknowledged with the rerelease of several older Mario titles.

In a country known for pomp and pageantry, the first state funeral since Winston Churchill\u2019s was filled with spectacle: Before the service, a bell tolled 96 times \u2014 once a minute for each year of Elizabeth\u2019s life. Then, 142 Royal Navy sailors used ropes to draw the gun carriage carrying her flag-draped coffin to Westminster Abbey, where pallbearers carried it inside and about 2,000 people ranging from world leaders to health care workers gathered to mourn.  The trappings of state and monarchy abounded: The coffin was draped with the Royal Standard and atop it was the Imperial State Crown, sparkling with almost 3,000 diamonds, and the sovereign\u2019s orb and scepter. But the personal was also present: The coffin was followed into the church by generations of Elizabeth\u2019s descendants, including King Charles III, heir to the throne Prince William and 9-year-old George, who is second in line.","Jaccard Noise_80":0.0,"Cosine Noise_80":0.5493694544,"EM Noise_80":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":0,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"Monday","Noise_100 Document Index":"0","Noise_100 Document":"Britain honored the life of Queen Elizabeth II with a state funeral steeped in tradition on Monday.

She received the mandate to form a government from Italy\u2019s President Sergio Mattarella on Friday afternoon after two days of official consultations, and is set to be sworn in at 10 a.m. local time (4 a.m. ET) on Saturday.           Last month\u2019s general election resulted in an alliance of far-right and center-right parties, led by her ultraconservative Brothers of Italy, winning enough seats in Italy\u2019s parliament to form a government.           Meloni announced her government picks in Rome\u2019s Quirinal Palace, making the leader of Italy\u2019s far right League party, Matteo Salvini, infrastructure minister.            Giancarlo Giorgetti, also of the League party, was made economy minister. Antonio Tajani from the Forza Italia party was given the position of minister of foreign affairs while the role of defense minister went to Guido Crosetto, one of the founders of the Brothers of Italy party.           The new government will be made up of a coalition of Meloni\u2019s Brothers of Italy party, Salvini\u2019s League party and the Forza Italia party, led by former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. The Brothers of Italy received nine ministries whereas Forza Italia and the League each received five ministries.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.9999998808,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Eugenia Roccella","Noise_20 Document Index":"7","Noise_20 Document":"no to Islamist violence, yes to secure borders, no to mass migration... no to big international finance... no to the bureaucrats of Brussels!\" In another well-quoted speech from 2019 she said: \"I am Giorgia, I'm a woman, I'm a mother...

Nevertheless, the new prime minister has promised to govern \"for everyone\" and she has sought to assure Italy's allies in both Nato and the European Union that there will be no change in direction in foreign policy. An important point as both Matteo Salvini who heads the League and Silvio Berlusconi have been strong admirers of Russia's Vladimir Putin. \"Giorgia Meloni comes from a post-fascist cultural background but recently she's taken a very moderate position and stated she won't change [predecessor Mario] Draghi's policy on Ukraine,\" Italian political scientist Prof Roberto D'Alimonte told the BBC. \"She did this because she had to build her credentials to be a legitimate candidate for prime minister.\" Giorgia Meloni hails from Garbatella in southern Rome, a working class but up-and-coming area.

After a week of infighting which overshadowed the negotiations, Meloni\u2019s warring coalition put forward a united front, backing Meloni to lead the country during formal talks with President Sergio Mattarella, on Friday.

Japan's influential and longest-serving prime minister worked to revitalize the nation's economy \u2014 with his namesake \"Abenomics\" policy \u2014 and rebuild its role on the global stage.

Beginning next year, Netflix will push people who borrow accounts to create their own, and will also give account-holders who share their passwords the ability to pay extra to have friends and family on their accounts. Here's what you need to know about Netflix's Basic With Ads tier. The Basic With Ads plan will operate similarly to the Basic plan. Users will have access to a 720p video stream \u2014 versus the 1080p stream offered by the $15.49 Standard plan and the 4K plan offered by the $19.99 Premium plan \u2014 which can be accessed from any internet-connected device.","Jaccard Noise_80":0.3333333333,"Cosine Noise_80":0.5771024227,"EM Noise_80":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":1,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"990 JPY\/month","Noise_100 Document Index":"4","Noise_100 Document":"Netflix offers a variety of plans to meet your entertainment needs.

It was included on the American Film Institute's list of the ten best programs of 2021 and 2022, and received various accolades including ten Primetime Emmy Awards, and two Golden Globes.

Between Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery, White Noise, and Triangle of Sadness, we got a ton of great content that forced the upper class to have traumatic vacations. The pinnacle of this was the second season of The White Lotus, which moved the miniseries to a luxurious new location in Italy. Unfortunately for the characters, this had more in common with the Italian scenery of The Talented Mr. Ripley than it did with Under The Tuscan Sun. As with the first season, the end of this trip is teased at the very beginning, and it\u2019s a violent one. Both seasons of The White Lotus take place at individual locations in a luxury vacation resort chain. A multitude of guests (most of whom are incredibly wealthy) interact with the staff and local residents, only to begin squabbling and bringing up past issues. While the show\u2019s brilliance stems from the inventive storytelling of writer\/director Mike White, it doesn\u2019t hurt that the show has the budget and scale of an HBO production. In order to make the series as authentic as possible, White and his production team utilized several real locations in both seasons.

Those bills are likely to become flashpoints in negotiations between the GOP, Democrats and the White House.  Biden, who served in the Senate for decades, has often touted his bipartisan credentials and said he wants to work with Republicans. But there would be little appetite for that in a GOP Congress that has made opposition to Biden its top priority.  While the Senate could tilt either way after the midterm elections, the majority party is still likely to have the slimmest of margins. That means Biden will be able to find a bit more common ground there, no matter who is in charge. Much of Biden\u2019s legislative achievements in office have been the byproduct of bipartisan negotiations in the Senate.  Still, a Republican-led Senate could pass bills sent over by a GOP House, putting political pressure on Biden. And the GOP would regain control of committees and, with it, the power to conduct investigations and oversight of the administration. A Republican Senate could also make life difficult for Biden by blocking or delaying passage of the president\u2019s judicial and executive branch nominees.

The BBC announced today that actress Millie Gibson has been cast on the British science fiction show Doctor Who as the titular time-traveler's new companion, or partner-in-adventures, Ruby Sunday. Gibson, 18, will star opposite Ncuti Gatwa, who is playing the Fifteenth Doctor. Gibson will make her debut on the show over the 2023 Christmas season. Her previous credits include the long-running British soap opera Coronation Street. \"Whilst still being in total disbelief, I am beyond honored to be cast as the Doctor's companion,\" Gibson said in a statement. \"It is a gift of a role, and a dream come true, and I will do everything to try and fill the boots the fellow companions have travelled in before me. And what better way to do that than being by the fabulous Ncuti Gatwa's side, I just can't wait to get started.\" \"Millie just is the companion,\" said Gatwa. \"She is full of talent, strength, she has a cheeky sparkle in her eye and is sharp as a razor. From the moment she walked into the room she captured all of our attention with her effervescence and then solidified that attention with the sheer torque of her talent.

In Doctor Who Season 14, coming 2024, not only will the eponymous Time Lord regenerate into Ncuti Gatwa but he\u2019ll also be joined by a human named Ruby Sunday, played by Millie Gibson. With this new pairing for the TARDIS, aspects of the new Doctor Who are starting to feel a bit retro for longtime fans. Is Who going back to basics?  Ncuti Gatwa and Millie Gibson; the new stars of Doctor Who. Following the brief \u2014 and as yet, unexplained \u2014 return of David Tennant as the Doctor, Ncuti Gatwa is set to become the incumbent Doctor by the end of 2023, and into the regular season, starting in 2024. And, on November 18, 2022, the BBC revealed that Millie Gibson will join Gatwa as the new companion. Interestingly, all the press around this news has focused on the word companion, as in a singular companion, rather than a group of companions. Throughout the tenure of Jodie Whittaker\u2019s 13th Doctor, the Doctor had a TARDIS team of three companions in Seasons 11 and 12, and two during the events of Flux (Season 13).","Jaccard Noise_20":1.0,"Cosine Noise_20":1.0,"EM Noise_20":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":1,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"Millie Gibson","Noise_40 Document Index":"6","Noise_40 Document":"This means, the time of the 13th Doctor generally consisted of a pretty packed TARDIS.

Will their partnership remind us of Amy Pond and the 11th Doctor? Or of Clara and the 12th? If we\u2019re lucky, the answer will be both all of the above, and none of the above. Doctor Who always subsists on an element of nostalgia to fuel the TARDIS, but here\u2019s hoping the upcoming era of Gatwa and Gibson will feel new, too.

Her unrequited feelings for him were a bit of a distraction at times, but they did at least lead to some real personal growth.

The British press referred to Martha as the \"first ethnic minority companion in the 43-year television history of Doctor Who\"[5]  despite the presence of Mickey Smith in the previous series\u2014including several episodes in which he travelled in the TARDIS with the Doctor.  The opening credits do little to clarify the situation.

The Criminal Minds reboot's new title - Criminal Minds: Evolution - resolves one of its biggest problems. Paramount+ is bringing back FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit (BAU) to the small screen not long after the team wrapped up its run on CBS for 15 years. While the profilers will miss a couple of their co-workers such as Matthew Gray Gubler's Spencer Reid and Daniel Henney's Matt Simmons, the rest of the squad will be intact as they track down a network of UnSubs which was established during the coronavirus pandemic. Many aspects of the original Criminal Minds run will stay the same, but Evolutions has some fresh aspects, including a new title. Retitling Paramount+'s Criminal Minds revival as Criminal Minds: Evolution is appropriate given this new version of the show. The project is a continuation of its CBS run, so technically, it isn't really a \"reboot\" as it has usually been referred to. The cast remains the same and its events take place in the same continuity. Instead of calling it Criminal Minds season 16, however, giving it a different title allows it to separate itself from the CBS procedural without totally severing its ties with it. It also hints that everything in Criminal Minds: Evolution is an evolved version of the original show, which seems to be the case.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.3333333333,"Cosine Noise_0":0.3522495031,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Evolution","Noise_20 Document Index":"2","Noise_20 Document":"'Grease: Rise Of The Pink Ladies' Gets VOD & DVD Release After Cancellation & Paramount+ Removal\t\t \t\t\t        Gilford will play Elias Voit, an operations analyst for a global cyber-security firm who has a dark side and obsession with death.

In a news release Saturday morning, Alberts pointed to Rhule's record at Temple University and Baylor University as \"evidence of Rhule's ability to build a program and made him an ideal fit at Nebraska.\" Rhule was most recently the head coach for the NFL Carolina Panthers team, where he was released after a 1-4 start. He's credited for improving the football programs at both Baylor and Temple while serving as a head coach. While coaching at Temple from 2013 to 2016, Rhule and the Owls won 28 games. The head coach took the Owls from a 2-win season in 2013 to racking up a 10-4 record in 2015.

(2:01) LINCOLN, Neb. -- Nebraska coach Matt Rhule has quickly endeared himself to one of the nation's most ardent fan bases in the five months since his hiring. Rhule has yet to coach his first game for the Cornhuskers, though, and the true test of his popularity will come in a year or two, when his work to bring back one of college football's biggest brands is fully underway. So far, he's proved to be a fast study and served up big portions of red meat, frequently referencing the program's traditional staples of hard work, physical practices and a pounding run game. Unlike some previous coaches, Rhule has made a point to pay homage to program standard-bearer Tom Osborne, the 86-year-old Hall of Fame coach who won national titles three of the four years before his retirement. Osborne has already done a roundtable discussion with Rhule and athletic director Trev Alberts and accepted Rhule's invitation to be featured speaker at the annual coaches clinic. Rhule also played an important role in helping Alberts get former coach Frank Solich to agree to be honored at Saturday's spring game. Solich, whose ties to the program date to the 1960s, has been mostly estranged since his controversial 2003 firing.","Jaccard Noise_80":1.0,"Cosine Noise_80":1.0,"EM Noise_80":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":1,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"Rhule","Noise_100 Document Index":"7","Noise_100 Document":"The Huskers' most recent conference championship came in 1999 under Osborne's successor, Frank Solich.

Greta Gerwig's Barbie, starring Margot Robbie as the eponymous doll and Ryan Gosling as Ken, finally arrives in theaters on July 21, 2023, after spending the better part of a decade in development. Gerwig's involvement was first announced in 2019, marking the 60th anniversary of Barbie herself.  Though Amy Schumer was originally attached to develop Mattel's signature feature, the comedian left the project when it was clear that executives at Mattel didn't see eye-to-eye with her feminist vision. \"They definitely didn't want to do it the way I wanted to do it, the only way I was interested in doing it,\" she told Andy Cohen on an episode of Watch What Happens Live. Something must have changed along the way because nearly everyone involved with the production of Barbie seems to agree that Gerwig's interpretation of the iconic character is both feminist and funny.

In doing so, they became the first Arab nation to advance to the last eight, ensuring a breakthrough for the region in the first global tournament in the Middle East, and also became the fourth African side to go this far in World Cup history. Their victory will be seen as not only a triumph for Morocco but vindication of the controversial FIFA decision to hand Qatar the hosting rights, adding significant gloss to another Arab success at the tournament like Saudi Arabia beating Argentina and Tunisia upsetting holders France in the group phase. Morocco, who edged Spain 3-0 in the shootout after a 0-0 draw at the end of two hours of energy-sapping action, now have a chance to become both the Arab world and Africa's first-ever semi-finalists if they continue to use the overwhelming support that has backed them through an impressive array of results.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":1.0,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Uruguay","Noise_20 Document Index":"1","Noise_20 Document":"Uruguay, the only South American team to reach the semi-finals, overcame Ghana in a penalty shoot-out after a 1\u20131 draw in which Ghana missed a penalty at the end of extra time after Luis Su\u00e1rez controversially handled the ball on the line.

Some might point to poor results in the last 12 years, but who is to say that increased participation would not have led to increased competition and improvement?  The prize money for simply participating in the World Cup could have been injected into grassroots football around the continent, significantly improving the quality of play. Nearly a century after the inaugural World Cup was hosted in Uruguay, Africa will finally be awarded a more equitable number of places, when we will have 9.5 places in 2026 - inching us a bit closer to global parity. The 2022 World Cup has also shown us that a lack of representation, not only in the form of qualification slots, but also in the form of hosting rights, can be extremely influential.  South Korea made the semi-finals in 2002 when they co-hosted the tournament, while the Black Stars of Ghana were a penalty-kick away from the semi-finals in 2010 in Africa's first World Cup in South Africa.  Is it merely a coincidence that Africa and Asia's best ever finishes came the only time the continents have hosted the tournaments? The 2022 World Cup has shown us that the answer is: probably not.

It wasn't until she began working in the software industry, however, that she realized that companies just throw away computers when it's time for an update. She said she knew there were children in Kenya who had no idea what a computer was and so TechLit Africa was born. TechLit Africa currently serves 10 schools and Cheboi hopes to be in 100 more within a year. Her students attend daily classes in a variety of computer skills, including coding, and they also have the opportunity to engage in remote learning. \"They can go from doing a remote class with NASA on education to music production,\" Cheboi said.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":1.0,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Nelly Cheboi","Noise_20 Document Index":"1","Noise_20 Document":"Nelly Cheboi was selected by viewers as the 2022 CNN Hero of the Year.

ESPN spoke to both a school president and athletic director on Tuesday who reiterated one of this obvious legacies from Emmert's tenure -- being the NCAA president is not a coveted job. Emmert himself entered the role with ambition and big ideas, only to end up spending the majority of his final years taking bullets for college presidents and flubbing seemingly every public appearance. Finding the next NCAA president will not be easy. One athletic director told ESPN: \"The big question is, 'Who would really want that job?' My question is, 'Do they bring someone in for 2-3 years that's trusted to get everyone through the choppy waters? Or do they go long term?'\" A short-term option could be someone like former Big 12 commissioner Bob Bowlsby or former NCAA executive Oliver Luck. They both know how thankless the job is, but they also still are true believers in college athletics. A popular internal option would be Dan Gavitt, the NCAA's senior vice president of basketball who is the association's most respected employee. The NCAA could also continue to go the route of college presidents, which has been the prior model the past two full-time presidents -- Myles Brand and Emmert. Washington State's Kirk Schultz, Baylor's Linda Livingstone and Clemson's Jim Clements are a few of more prominent presidents in the athletics realm.","Jaccard Noise_60":0.0,"Cosine Noise_60":0.3997102082,"EM Noise_60":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_60":0,"Noise_80 Predicted Answer":"Paolo Uggetti","Noise_80 Document Index":"3","Noise_80 Document":"I've never once said we can't continue on if things keep going the way they were. I've always wanted players to get their due and their fair share. But there used to be a skill involved in building a program. Now that's not a skill at all. It's whoever can go out and buy the best team. And all the work we did on APR and graduation rates, that was for the kids. And it worked. And that's all out the window.\" So the next person will have to find a way to keep the best coaches and staffers in college football despite a 24\/7, 365-day calendar now. And ideally, they'd have the political skills to try to wrangle a national solution for the varying slates of laws affecting amateur athletics across the country. Paolo Uggetti: Frankly, catch up. Or at least try to. As the rest of my colleagues have put it, this NCAA has done nearly everything in its power to look slow and incompetent the past few years. Their way of handling nearly every major issue college athletics has faced has been, at best, archaic, and at worst, willfully malicious. It's hard to imagine just how its reputation and standing could be worse at such a crucial time in college sports; it's also hard to fathom what it can do now to get better.","Jaccard Noise_80":0.0,"Cosine Noise_80":0.3063967228,"EM Noise_80":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":0,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"Rittenberg","Noise_100 Document Index":"6","Noise_100 Document":"Yet for as bad as things are, there still could be value in a governing body that accepted the realities of the entities it claims to police instead of trying to squash them in the name of amateurism. I mean, college athletes are now selling their own licensed apparel at their program's spring games -- the cat is all the way out of the \"student-athlete\" bag. It might be too late to turn back the clock and fix things under a new president, but if the NCAA was serious about wanting to evolve, it could start by simply appointing someone who believes the athletes are closer to equals who need to be heard and valued than subordinates who need to be controlled. Rittenberg: A successful NCAA president must inform and protect the school presidents, but also connect better with conference commissioners who essentially control the money and the most important sports, namely football. The next president must push a more aggressive agenda to get things done and be more mindful of what lies ahead in such a turbulent landscape. The inability to get ahead on name, image and likeness and other major areas ultimately doomed Emmert's tenure and damaged confidence in the association, outside of the presidents. This is a largely thankless job, but the NCAA needs someone who can communicate with the presidents and not bother them too much, but also work much better with the practitioners who will shape the future.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.2003918141,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

Still, many details are under wrap, and the movie hasn\u2019t even got a trailer. Yet, Netflix believes so very much in the Rebel Moon potential of the film that a sequel is being filmed back-to-back.

REDMOND, Wash. \u2014 Microsoft unveiled a new version of its Bing search engine on Tuesday that incorporates cutting-edge artificial intelligence technology, which company executives hope will help it eventually dethrone Google as the No. 1 search service. Microsoft is teaming up with OpenAI, the San Francisco research lab behind ChatGPT, to revamp Bing so that it can handle more complicated queries alongside providing factual information. \"It's a new day for search,\" said Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella in an announcement made at the company's headquarters on Tuesday. \"In fact, a race starts today in terms of what you can expect.\"  Microsoft's announcement that it is doubling down on what is considered the hottest new technology is a direct challenge to Google, the dominant player in online search for decades. Google controls about 90% of the online search market. Microsoft executive Yusuf Mehdi provided a demonstration of the retooled Bing at a briefing with reporters. The new version is being teased for the public in a \"limited preview,\" with a true public launch coming soon, executives said.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.2609081566,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":0,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"artificial intelligence","Noise_20 Document Index":"4","Noise_20 Document":"Microsoft has announced a new version of its search engine Bing, which incorporates the latest in artificial intelligence. The overhaul deploys OpenAI's ChatGPT technology, which has taken the world by storm since its launch last year. The move is by far the biggest threat Google has seen to its dominance in web search - and marks the beginning of an AI arms race between the companies. \"The race starts today,\" Microsoft boss Satya Nadella said.  Developed by Microsoft-backed OpenAI, ChatGPT uses deep learning techniques to generate human-like responses to search requests. Mr Nadella said he thought it was poised to change the nature of online search - and interactions with many other software.  \"This technology will reshape pretty much every software category that we know,\" he said.  Bing will now respond to search queries with more detailed answers - not just links to websites.  Users are also able to chat with the bot to better tailor their queries. More contextual answers will be added on the right hand side of a search page. The new Bing search engine will be live right away - with a limited number of searches for each person.  The announcement comes a day after Google revealed details of its own new chatbot, Bard. Both companies are scrambling to get their products to market.  In a note to investors after the announcement, analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities said he thought that Microsoft's investment would \"massively boost\" the firm's ability to compete.","Jaccard Noise_20":0.0,"Cosine Noise_20":0.2609081566,"EM Noise_20":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":0,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"chatbot","Noise_40 Document Index":"1","Noise_40 Document":"Feb 7, 2023 ...

It is the fourth main installment of the Pikmin series, following Pikmin 3 (2013), and the sixth installment overall. It was released on the Nintendo Switch on July 21, 2023.[1]  The game is the first in the series to feature a customizable playable character. It introduces two new species of Pikmin called Ice Pikmin and Glow Pikmin, as well as new features like the Night Expeditions, in which players defend against waves of nocturnal enemies. In the story, the player assumes the role of a recently recruited member of the Rescue Corps, a group in need of rescuing following an unsuccessful attempt to save Captain Olimar.  Pikmin 4 received positive reviews from critics, who praised the game's level design, visuals, score, amount of content, and accessibility to newcomers, while criticizing the limited multiplayer options and low difficulty.  The player controls a minuscule character who takes command of squads of Pikmin to explore various areas, fight enemies, secure treasures, and solve puzzles.[2] Pikmin can be directed to perform various tasks, such as carrying objects and fighting enemies, and have individual weaknesses and strengths.

There were lots of things to look at and analyze but for now, here are some shots and comments from the game.  GO HOKIES!!! The crowd was easily over 20,000 people.  Hokie Hi weekend featured Friday and Saturday celebrations with an evening tribute to the fallen 32 from April 16th 2007.  The morning on Saturday was the 3.2 mile Run and Walk for Remembrance, and the crowd there was estimated to be 15,000 or so.  The weather in Blacksburg not only cooperated, it assisted by being comfortably warm, without being hot, and a light breeze was blowing.  It was a magnificent way to honor the fallen and celebrate their memories as Hokies.   The Maroon Squad Offense was obviously mostly #1s int he depth chart, with Grant Wells starting at Maroon Squad QB.  He\u2019d remain there for the first half.   We\u2019ll talk about the various observations in a coming article, but overall, he did well and seemed like he was much more comfortable than he was last season.

Da'Quan Felton, another transfer wide receiver, caught two passes for 40 yards to lead all receivers on team White. Considering the team scored a total of 0 points, Felton's stat-line is neither impressive nor insignificant. He seems like a bid-bodied wide receiver that will go up and make contested catches for whomever is named QB1. Bhayshul Tuten didn't record any rushing attempts, perhaps for precautionary reasons, but did make two catches for 2 yards. It was a quiet afternoon Tuten, as the Hokies went with Duke and Black to carry most of the load.\u00a0 Defensively, Derrick Canteen recorded an interception on Drones. He is another player who backed up his off-season praise by making a play on Saturday.

The iPhone-maker\u2019s first retail stores in India have been long-anticipated, but the limited market for high-end smartphones and laptops in the country has tempered Apple\u2019s expansion efforts.

Apple said that the new retail locations \u201cmark a significant expansion in India that will offer great new ways to browse, discover, and buy Apple products with exceptional service and experiences for customers.\u201d In preparation for the store openings, Apple has been actively recruiting employees in recent months, according to growing job postings.

But the negatives for markets are becoming too hard to ignore for Koch and the other realists that Yahoo Finance chatted up at the Milken Conference. Koch believes the economy is headed into a credit crunch, in part fueled by the rolling banking crisis that continues to unfold. As that lending plays out, Koch thinks it could begin to weigh on the commercial real estate market. \"[Regional banks] have this dual pressure from both deposit outflow and their commercial real estate exposure, and that's going to put pressure on those banks,\" she explained. \"It's going to put pressure on their ability to extend credit, which in turn is going to put pressure on the economy and jobs.

I was surprised because I have been wary of foldable phones. The earliest models released by Samsung, Motorola and Huawei about four years ago had glaring flaws. They were thick and heavy, had durability issues and lacked software to take advantage of their novel hardware.

While large language models like GPT are trained on public data, that\u2019s less important when it comes to working with the data stored in your own applications. Again, Azure OpenAI offers some clues, with the option to use a custom model that blends the existing GPT LLM with a selection of your own data.

After years of development, Apple has today unveiled the first iteration of its AR glasses - which is essentially a Meta Quest unit, minus VR. Apple\u2019s first step into mixed reality is called the Vision Pro, which will incorporate a range of potential use cases. As outlined in the video, Apple\u2019s touting this as a \u2018new era of spatial computing\u2019, with simplified eye and finger controls to interact, digital elements that respond to real-world cues, and immersive AR elements. Which looks pretty good, and there are potentially some amazing use cases that could stem from the new device. But as noted, pretty much all of the same can be done in a Meta Quest VR unit already, with the addition of full VR, which the Vision Pro doesn\u2019t have. And for a lot cheaper. At launch, coming early next year, the Vision Pro will be priced at a whopping $3,499. For comparison, the new Quest 3 unit, coming this fall, will be $499. Yeah, not sure Apple has cracked the unit pricing aspect as yet.  Of course, things might be different if the Vision Pro was something that you could wear outside the house, if Apple had been able to integrate full AR and pass-through capability into stylish glasses, like Meta\u2019s Stories collaboration with Ray Ban.

And these intuitive controls are meant to feel natural as well. Apple says all it takes is turning your head to shift the focus of the display, or a simple tap of your fingers to simulate a mouse click. You can even keep your hands in a natural position rather than holding them in front of you when making gestures. Glancing at a search bar and speaking will even allow you to type into the search bar for easy use. Aside from these new methods of controlling the mixed reality headset, there are two familiar features. First, Siri is back, giving you Apple's famous voice assistant right out of the box. Second, the headset does work with a range of Bluetooth products. In addition to supporting controllers like the PS5 DualSense, it also supports the Apple Magic Keyboard, Mouse and Trackpad in case you don't want to rely on hand gestures or a virtual keyboard.

At its annual developer conference, Apple also introduced a raft of new products and features, including a 15-inch MacBook Air, a powerful chip called M2 Ultra, improvements to its iOS software and a long-awaited tweak to prevent its autocorrect from annoyingly changing a common expletive to \"ducking\". The Vision Pro will start at $3,499, more than three times the cost of the priciest headset in Meta's line of mixed and virtual reality devices. The headset will test a market crowded with devices that have yet to gain traction with consumers and put it in direct competition with Facebook-owner Meta after years of clashes between the companies over issues like user privacy and control of developer platforms. Apple emphasized the novelty of the headset's augmented reality features as well as the sports and entertainment partnerships it would offer. The device will use a new chip called R1 that will process information from its sensors in less time than the blink of an eye, Apple said. But the announcements failed to excite Wall Street, which had bid up Apple shares to a record high ahead of the launch.

Amazon\u2019s summer Prime Day sale hasn\u2019t even begun, but speculation of a similar sale is already underway. The retailer first introduced the concept of a major sale on October 13 and 14, 2020, after its summer Prime Day sale was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic. But after returning to business as usual with the launch of Prime Day 2021 in June\u2014the earliest kick-off to date\u2014Amazon followed up its July 2022 Prime Day sale with its inaugural Prime Early Access Sale, on October 11 and 12, 2022. It remains to be seen whether Amazon plans to follow suit this fall with a 2023 Prime Early Access Sale, but it\u2019s very possible that the retailer could seize the opportunity to get ahead of its competitors before Black Friday 2023 sales begin in November. Amazon promises Prime-exclusive deals on Wirecutter-recommended brands like Sony, Bose, and Theragun. The company is also introducing an invite-only deals program for products it has deemed likely to sell out\u2014Prime members can sign up for access in advance of the event.","Jaccard Noise_20":0.0,"Cosine Noise_20":0.6403988004,"EM Noise_20":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":0,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"Jul 14","Noise_40 Document Index":"4","Noise_40 Document":"Jul 14, 2023 ...

Beginning Monday, July 3, 2023, through Monday, July 10, 2023, Prime members can get a $5 promotional credit with the purchase of an Amazon eGift Card worth $50 or more. This is a nice opportunity to save a little extra if you already plan to spend at least $50 on Prime Day\u2014especially since that $50 gift card can also be applied to your purchase. After an order is placed, shoppers will receive an email with instructions for redeeming the credit (which is redeemable through Friday, August 25), and their savings will reflect at checkout. There is a caveat, though: This credit can be applied only to items shipped and sold by Amazon, not products sold by third-party sellers or gift cards. Only current Prime members qualify for this offer. But that shouldn\u2019t be a problem, considering you also have to be a Prime member to score many of Amazon\u2019s Prime Day deals.
