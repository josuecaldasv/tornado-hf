{"Query":"The genre of the drama \"Good Sam\" is what?","Correct Answer":["medical"],"Noise_0 Predicted Answer":"medical procedural","Noise_0 Document Index":"1","Noise_0 Document":"Sam Griffith (Sophia Bush) is a female lead, still a rarity in medical dramas. The cast diversity is notable: Malcolm Kinglsey (Edwin Hodge) is a Black man from a wealthy, prominent family. Wealthy Black Americans aren't usually showcased on television. Malcolm is also a love interest for Sam, adding to the representation of interracial relationships on television. However, most of the diversity comes in the form of the secondary cast (Skye P.

If it's serious and more precise with the medical details, you're in ER territory. If it's lighter and more on the soapy side of things, you're compared to Grey's Anatomy. Every now and then, one tries to be both (and fails). Good Sam falls very much into the Grey's Anatomy category, complete with a main character forced to live in the shadow of their larger than life parent. In this case, Sam's father is like Dr House: abrasive, cocky, mean and of course the most brilliant person in the room. Because that's not enough, he also has cancer. You know, like New Amsterdam's hero. So, yeah, it's not the most original pilot script. To be fair, Good Sam certainly isn't the most egregious of the Grey's wannabes. It doesn't rely on love stories nearly as much, at least initially. Sam has a boyfriend at the beginning, but then she doesn't anymore. And although there's another character she could fall in love with, that's not the main focus. The focus is her wrought relationship with her father; one that gets more complicated when Griff suddenly awakens from a months-long coma and learns that Sam has become the new Chief of Surgery.","Jaccard Noise_20":0.0,"Cosine Noise_20":0.3327082098,"EM Noise_20":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":0,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"medical drama","Noise_40 Document Index":"1","Noise_40 Document":"The new CBS drama Good Sam is likely to draw viewers towards more shows that revolve around medical drama and family issues.

Here\u2019s how it works. Sophia Bush is back on TV for Good Sam, and here's how the CBS drama compares to other current medical shows. Spoilers ahead for the series premiere of Good Sam on CBS. CBS has officially gotten into the medical drama game with the debut of Good Sam, starring Sophia Bush in her big series regular return to network television after her exit from Chicago P.D. in 2017. As Dr. Sam Griffith, Bush \u2013\u00a0in her first turn playing a doctor on TV \u2013\u00a0takes on a leadership role at her hospital by becoming chief of surgery\u2026 with the complication that her father (played by Jason Isaacs) formerly held that position before ending up in a coma after being shot. When he awakes and must work under his daughter, there are more problems than just medical mysteries for Sam to deal with.\u00a0 The show packed a lot into the pilot episode to establish not only Sam and dad Rob \u201cGriff\u201d Griffith, but also her mom and her team of doctors who are used to following Griff\u2019s lead rather than Sam\u2019s.

What microchip shortage? EV maker Tesla, which it should be pointed out produces its own chips in-house, seems not to have been bothered by supply-chain issues all that much in 2021, delivering 936,172 vehicles in the year just ended, according to a report by finance news outlet Finbold. That represents a healthy 87 percent increase over 2020, when the company handed over 499,550 Teslas to customers. Even better for the company, it ended the year with a bang, racking up a record number of sales in the last quarter of 2021, or 308,600 units. Most of that total consisted of Model 3 and Model Y models, no surprise. It\u2019s the sixth consecutive quarter that it breaks its record for sales. In 2019, the automaker delivered 367,500 units, so annual sales growth, while not exponential, is clearly accelerating. The company has said in the past that one its main goals is to attain 50 percent sales growth year after year. Once upon a time, Tesla struggled mightily to hit its delivery targets, but no more. There\u2019s also no sign of that growth slowing down any time soon, even as all-electric rivals join the market by the month. Projections made by Finbold put estimated sales for 2022 at over 1.5 million units, for an increase of close to 65 percent.

Then, in 2003, Carolyn Bertozzi proposed that click chemistry could be used in studies of biological systems to make it easier to observe vital cellular processes without interfering with them. Bertozzi called this \u201cbioorthogonal\u201d chemistry in a paper\u00a0she and her colleagues published that year. The term has since been\u00a0widely-adopted term in the field. The ability to perform complex reactions in living systems without interfering with natural biological reactions made it possible to study molecules and cellular processes in cells and inside complex organisms such as zebra fish, rather than in laboratory dishes. It has already helped scientists understand an important protein processing reaction called glycosylation, helped to develop molecular imaging molecules that could detect disease in living organisms, and opened up the possibility of selectively delivering drugs to particular tissues in the body. These findings have \u201cled to a revolution in how chemists think about linking molecules together and how to do it in living cells,\u201d \u00c5qvist said.

Russia's President Vladimir Putin has given varying public explanations for why he launched the invasion. Here are the reasons Putin gave, how they match with reality, and the other likely reasons why Russia sent its armed forces into an independent, sovereign nation. Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union, before declaring itself an independent country, cementing the move in a referendum days before the USSR collapsed in December 1991. The country has maintained its independence ever since. But Putin still refers to Ukraine as Russian, and denies it's a nation in its own right. He told then-US President George W. Bush in 2008 that Ukraine wasn't even a country. Stephen Hall, a Russian politics expert at the University of Bath in the UK, said many Russians still hold this view, and that \"it isn't just the Kremlin.\" Hall said Russia sees Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, as the \"mother of Russian cities,\" and for Putin he can't have that being outside his own country. Hall added that Russia needs to claim Ukraine in order to back up its argument to being a great power that has existed for millennia. Without it \"Russia can't claim a thousand years of history because Kyiv was already in existence 1,200 years ago, when Moscow was a forest,\" he said.","Jaccard Noise_80":0.6666666667,"Cosine Noise_80":0.7834084034,"EM Noise_80":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":1,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"7 April,","Noise_100 Document Index":"0","Noise_100 Document":"183] On 31 March, the Ukrainian military confirmed Izium was under Russian control,[184][185] and PBS News reported renewed shelling and missile attacks in Kharkiv, as bad or worse than before, as peace talks with Russia were to resume in Istanbul.[186]  Amid the heightened Russian shelling of Kharkiv on 31 March, Russia reported a helicopter strike against an oil supply depot approximately 35 kilometres (22\u00a0mi) north of the border in Belgorod, and accused Ukraine of the attack.[187] Ukraine denied responsibility.[188] By 7 April, the renewed massing of Russian invasion troops and tank divisions around the towns of Izium, Sloviansk, and Kramatorsk prompted Ukrainian government officials to advise the remaining residents near the eastern border of Ukraine to evacuate to western Ukraine within 2\u20133 days, given the absence of arms and munitions previously promised to Ukraine by then.[189]  By 17 April, Russian progress on the south-eastern front appeared to be impeded by opposing Ukrainian forces in the large, heavily fortified Azovstal steel mill and surrounding area in Mariupol.[190]","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.5893059373,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

But despite many fans diving back into the game over and over again (there is 6 endings after all), most of the community are desperate to see what the developer does with the game next, especially with regards to more post-launch content. At this point, nothing has been officially announced with both FromSoftware and Publisher Bandai Namco avoiding any concrete answers on the future of the game. That being said, FromSoftware does have a history of releasing DLC for their previous titles. Dark Souls 1-3, Bloodborne and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice all received hefty post-launch support and content updates. There have also been hints in press releases, with one including a quote from Bandai Namco Entertainment President and CEO Yasuo Miyakawa which talks about \u201cexpanding the brand beyond the game itself\u201d. Clearly Bandai Namco know they need to capitalise on a game as significant as Elden Ring, and you would imagine one of the easiest ways to do that would be via post launch content.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.5,"Cosine Noise_100":0.8393336535,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

The A16's higher cost is likely due in part to the chip being manufactured based on TSMC's 4nm process, while the A15 is a 5nm chip. iPhone chips could continue to increase in price as miniaturization continues, with rumors suggesting the A17 chip in iPhone 15 Pro models will be based on TSMC's 3nm process, and a DigiTimes report this week claiming that TSMC will begin volume production of 2nm chips in 2025. Geekbench 5 benchmark results indicate the A16 chip delivers around 15% to 17% faster multi-core performance compared to the A15 chip. Only the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max are equipped with the A16 chip, while the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus have the same A15 chip with a five-core GPU as found in iPhone 13 Pro models.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.9999999404,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"A15","Noise_20 Document Index":"5","Noise_20 Document":"With the A16, Apple's transistor count increased only modestly from\u00a015 billion transistors on the A15.

You may not notice new chip performance directly, but it's key to delivering new abilities, like the iPhone 14 Pro's advanced photo and video processing. The act of taking a photo exercises the A16's CPU, GPU, image processor and neural engine, cranking out up to 4 trillion operations per photo to deliver an image.

Here\u2019s how it works. The M2 chip is here, ushering in the second generation of Apple's bespoke silicon The Apple M2 chip was unveiled at Apple's WWDC 2022 keynote on June 6, and it's the inaugural chip in Apple's second generation of bespoke silicon. This is significant because the M2 is an evolution of the remarkable M1 chip that debuted in 2020, and it powers Apple's new 13-inch MacBook Air 2022 and MacBook Pro 2022. These are successors to two of the best MacBooks on the market, so it's exciting to see what an M2 injection can do. The new Apple M2 chip debuted in two new laptops: the 13-inch MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, which launched in the Summer of 2022. The M2 chip is available in either the 13-inch MacBook Air 2022 (starting price: $1,199) or the MacBook Pro 2022 ($1,299), so you'll need to pay over $1k to get yourself an M2-powered MacBook.  It's also available in the Mac mini M2, a cheaper and more powerful version of Apple's pint-sized Mac. Apple's new M2 chip is configurable with an 8-core CPU and up to a 10-core GPU.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.4580761492,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":0,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Summer 2022.","Noise_20 Document Index":"6","Noise_20 Document":"Jul 20, 2022 ...

This guide highlights everything you need to know about the M2 chip, from performance improvements to extra features.    The M2 is Apple's next-generation System on a Chip (SoC) developed for use in Macs and iPads. It marks Apple's continued work to transition away from the Intel chips that were used in Macs up until 2020. As a \"System on a Chip,\" the M2 integrates several different components, including the CPU, GPU, unified memory architecture (RAM), Neural Engine, Secure Enclave, SSD controller, image signal processor, encode\/decode engines, Thunderbolt controller with USB 4 support, and more, all of which power the different features in the Mac. Before Apple silicon, Macs used multiple chips for CPU, I\/O, and security, but Apple's effort to integrate these chips is the reason why the M2 is much faster and more efficient than Intel chips. The unified memory architecture that Apple has included is also a major factor because all of the technologies in the M2 are able to access the same data without having to swap between multiple pools of memory. Built into the M2 chip, the unified memory architecture means the CPU, GPU, and other processor components don't need to copy data between one another, and are able to access the same data pool.","Jaccard Noise_40":0.3333333333,"Cosine Noise_40":0.7838338614,"EM Noise_40":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":0,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"June 2022,","Noise_60 Document Index":"3","Noise_60 Document":"When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission.

A little meta here, but sometimes recognition breeds recognition with award shows \u2014 and going into the voting, no artist was more recognized in the nominations at this year\u2019s Grammys than Jon Batiste. The singer\/songwriter\/instrumentalist scored a staggering 11 nods for the evening, including an additional Big Four nomination in song of the year (for \u201cFreedom\u201d), and genre nods that ranged from best R&B performance to best improvised jazz solo to to best American roots song. Such a large number of nominations (three more than any other artist on Sunday) is bound to grab attention, and perhaps a number of ballots from future voters who might\u2019ve otherwise not been familiar: If you\u2019re doing some light research but don\u2019t have time to check out all the nominees you don\u2019t already know, you\u2019d be more likely to check out the artist with 11 nominations than one with just a handful (or only the one, in the case of Taylor Swift and Evermore).

Twitter invited Musk to join its board of directors, an offer he initially accepted before declining.

Musk stated that he planned to introduce new features to the platform, make its algorithms open-source, combat spambot accounts, and promote free speech.  In July, Musk announced his intention to terminate the agreement, asserting that Twitter had breached their agreement by refusing to crack down on spambot accounts.

But he only used some of his cash to buy Twitter for $44 billion. For the rest of it, he used a tactic called a leveraged buyout and spent $13 billion of borrowed money on the acquisition. And now Twitter\u2014not Elon\u2014is on the hook for that loan. Leveraged buyouts had a heyday in the 1980s, when corporate raiders would use debt to finance purchases of companies with healthy balance sheets. The Twitter acquisition, though, is a whole different beast\u2014and as its employees leave en masse and its ad revenues continue to fall, the banks who put up billions to finance the deal might be second guessing their decision.

But many of the commitments to the Tesla CEO were pledged back in the spring. A group of banks, including Morgan Stanley and Bank of America, signed on earlier this year to loan $12.5 billion that Musk needed to buy Twitter and take it private. Solid contracts with Musk bound the banks to the financing, although changes in the economy and debt markets since April have likely made the terms less attractive.  Investors who would get ownership stakes in Twitter were also expected to chip in billions. Musk\u2019s original slate of equity partners included an array of parties ranging from the billionaire\u2019s tech world friends with like-minded ideas about Twitter\u2019s future, such as Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, to funds controlled by Middle Eastern royalty. Billionaire Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal said Friday that he and his Kingdom Holding Company rolled over a combined $1.89 billion in existing Twitter shares, making them the company\u2019s largest shareholder after Musk. Another equity investor, the cryptocurrency exchange Binance, confirmed Friday that it put in $500 million.  The more equity investors kicked in for the deal, the less Musk would have had to pay on his own. Most of Musk\u2019s wealth is tied up in shares of his electric car company. Since April, he has sold more than $15 billion worth of Tesla stock, presumably to pay his share.","Jaccard Noise_80":1.0,"Cosine Noise_80":0.9033486843,"EM Noise_80":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":1,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"$2.64\u00a0billion,[11]","Noise_100 Document Index":"0","Noise_100 Document":"[8] Days later, he discussed the future of social media with Twitter co-founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey and explored the possibility of joining Twitter's board of directors with private equity firm Silver Lake co-CEO Egon Durban.

Scottie Scheffler dominated the final three rounds of the 2022 Masters en route to a green jacket, record $2.7 million payout and further enshrinement as the hottest golfer on the planet, carding a 10-under 278 to win his first career major on Sunday.  Scheffler became the fifth golfer to enter Augusta National ranked No. 1 in the world and go on to win the Masters, joining Ian Woosnam (1991), Fred Couples (1992), Tiger Woods (2001-02) and Dustin Johnson (2020).  The victory was his fourth on the PGA Tour this season, making him the first golfer since Arnold Palmer in 1960 -- and only the second ever -- to win as many events including the Masters in that span of time to begin a season, according to Justin Ray.  Scheffler is on such a heater that he actually won all four of those PGA Tour events in just a 57-day span, marking the shortest stretch from a first to fourth victory in PGA Tour history.

In winning the title, Nadal broke the record for all-time men's major singles title - it was previously tied at 20 between himself, Novak Djokovic, and Roger Federer. The women's singles title was won by Ashleigh Barty, who won her first Australian Open title and third major title. She defeated 27th seed Danielle Collins in straight sets.

By Matthew Futterman Reporting from Melbourne, Australia Aryna Sabalenka is no longer afraid of big stages. Overcoming a history of buckling under the pressure of late-round Grand Slam tennis, Sabalenka, the powerful 24-year-old from Belarus, came from behind to beat Elena Rybakina of Kazakhstan 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 in the women\u2019s singles final of the Australian Open on Saturday. In a matchup of two of the biggest hitters in the sport, Sabalenka was a little more fearless and a few clicks more clinical than Rybakina in the crucial moments to cap off a dominant summer of tennis in Australia. It was Sabalenka\u2019s first Grand Slam title in a rocky career that has included the kind of error-ridden, big-moment meltdowns from which some players almost never recover. Instead, the match proved a microcosm of Sabalenka\u2019s career \u2014 a shaky start, filled with ill-timed double faults followed by a steadying midmatch recovery before a final-set display of raw power and precision that her opponent could not answer. And it all went down after Sabalenka decided last year to make a contrarian move in an era when athletes train their minds as hard as they train their bodies.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.3532099128,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

The victory gave Djokovic his seventh singles title at Wimbledon and his fourth in a row. He secured the trophy he cherishes more than any other with his 28th consecutive match win at Wimbledon.

Semiconductor shortages derailed the post-COVID recovery, affecting vehicle sales worldwide. But the shortages have eased a bit one year later and auto sales are reviving. Automakers expect to recover the losses made during the last two years, soon. However, traditional automakers are unable to cope with the rising demand for pure EVs, whereas Tesla\u2019s ability to address this demand has rewarded it not only with higher vehicle sales in Q1 2022 but also a record revenue of $18.8 billion. Tesla has also started deliveries to car rental service provider Hertz against its huge 100,000-vehicle order, which is also a reason for high vehicle production and delivery during the quarter. Tesla\u2019s Q1 2022 revenue would have been more without the fresh COVID wave that has hit Shanghai and surrounding areas, affecting the company\u2019s production there. From the second week of March, rising cases of a new COVID variant have forced automakers operating around Shanghai to suspend production. The urge to achieve L4 autonomy by the end of 2023 and to roll out robotaxis by early 2025 can be a major reason for Tesla\u2019s big R&D spend. Besides, Tesla could also be conducting research on developing new battery chemistry.

Yesterday, we posted\u00a0our Tesla Q1 2022 earnings preview\u00a0with Wall Street expectations and crowdsourced expectations. The Wall Street consensus for this quarter was $17.659 billion in revenue and earnings of $2.26 per share. The expectations represent a massive year-over-year increase after Tesla achieved a new record for deliveries with over 310,000 deliveries during the quarter. Tesla released the results today and beat Wall Street expectations on both revenue and earnings with $18,756 billion in revenue and $3.22 per share (non-GAAP) during the first quarter of 2022.

This article explains what ProRAW is and how to enable it. Apple's biggest camera upgrade for the \u200ciPhone 14 Pro\u200c and \u200ciPhone 14 Pro\u200c Max models is to the Main lens, which has been increased to 48 megapixels.  Apple says the new sensor also comes with a \"new machine learning model [that] delivers sharper images and less noise for unprecedented detail.\" However, this only applies when taking ProRAW shots at 48 megapixels. Otherwise, the camera defaults to shooting in 12-megapixel resolution, similar to iPhone 13 models.  There's a good reason for this. ProRAW is a 10-bit file that uses the Linear DNG format to retain more information and dynamic range, providing additional flexibility when editing exposure and white balance. With a ProRAW image containing 8,064 x 6,048 pixels, these files consume a significant amount of storage and can be approximately 75MB in size, or three times the size of an average 12-megapixel image.  Unless you have the largest capacity 1TB \u200ciPhone 14 Pro\u200c model, you're unlikely to want to shoot at this resolution all the time.","Jaccard Noise_40":1.0,"Cosine Noise_40":1.0,"EM Noise_40":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":1,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"12","Noise_60 Document Index":"5","Noise_60 Document":"Apple did not go into great detail about the camera hardware changes here, but thankfully Techinsights took the entire camera package apart.

While its aperture is slightly \u2018slower\u2019 (that is, smaller) the larger sensor compensates. How does the sensor and lens change stack up in practice? The iPhone 14 Pro easily outperforms the previous iPhone, creating far sharper shots: In multiple shots in various conditions, the shots were far more detailed and exhibited less visible processing than comparable iPhone 13 Pro shots: A nice side benefit of a larger sensor is a bit more shallow depth of field. At a 13mm full-frame equivalent, you really can\u2019t expect too much subject separation, but this shot shows some nice blurry figures in the background.  I believe that both Apple\u2019s new Photonic Engine and the larger sensor are contributing to a lot more detail in the frame, which makes a cropped image like the above shot possible. The \u2018my point of view\u2019 perspective that the ultra-wide provides puts you in the action, and a lack of detail makes every shot less immersive.  Is it all perfect?

Here's how 48MP ProRAW images compare to 12MP shots The iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max have some major camera advantages over the regular iPhone 14, such as a 3x telephoto zoom lens. But a new exclusive feature for this year is a 48MP sensor for the main wide camera in the Pro models. And based on my testing, it produces some pretty amazing results.\u00a0 The new 48MP sensor on the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max is 65% larger than the one on the iPhone 13 Pro, and it features a second-gen sensor-shift optical image stabilization system. The main camera\u2019s sensor can optimize for light capture and group every four pixels into a larger quad-pixel (resulting in 12MP shots) or use each pixel individually to optimize for detail in higher-resolution 48MP pics.\u00a0 It\u2019s the latter scenario that I was interested in for this comparison, which shows what happens when you use the ProRAW format and shoot full 48MP photos.

The iPhone 14 Pro\u2019s main camera, however, puts four times as many pixels in that same space: You might be wondering why, exactly, it would not squeeze in four times as many pixels in an equally \u2018mosaicked\u2019 pattern, instead opting for this four-by-four pattern known as \u2018Quad Bayer\u2019.  While we can dedicate an entire post to the details of camera sensors, allow me to briefly explain the benefits. Apple has a few main desires when it comes to its camera. Resolution was not the only reason to move to a more advanced, larger and higher pixel-count sensor. Apple desires speed, low noise, light gathering ability, dynamic range (that is, detail in both shadow and light areas) and many more things from this sensor.  As we mentioned before, algorithms are required to \u2018de-mosaic\u2019 this color information.

For starters, the Apple Self Service Repair Store website only sells parts and tools for the iPhone, and only for the iPhone 12 model and newer.\u00a0 Depending on what part of the phone you are trying to repair, different parts and tools are available, varying in price. The website also gives you the option to rent the repair kit with all the tools required or to purchase the tools separately based on user needs.\u00a0 If users choose to rent the kit, they will actually be renting two large kits weighing 43 pounds and 36 pounds for $49. However, the rental period is only 7 days, and a temporary authorization is placed on your account in case you fail to return the kit by the end of the rental period.

There is also a new mechanic called interlinking, which you can learn more about in our Xenoblade Chronicles 3 Ouroboros guide.

The game had sold 1.86 million copies by March 2023. An expansion taking place before the events of the game, Future Redeemed, was released in April 2023.  Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is an action role-playing game with a large open world. Unlike previous Xenoblade games, the game allows for up to seven party members to participate in battles at once, including the main party of six and an additional \"Hero\" character. Up to 19 Heroes can be recruited to the party through story events or sidequests, each with different skills and abilities. Party members also have the ability to change their character class, granting them access to different abilities; raising a Hero's affinity with the party will unlock their class for use. Like the previous entries, the game has an open world design, with a day-and-night time cycle that affects in-game events, such as the availability of quests and items. The game takes place in a continuous open world that is the largest map featured in the series to date.[1] It also features a fast travel option for quicker traversal, as well as the option to activate navigation that will mark a line on the ground to follow if players are unsure of how to reach their destination.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.5136356354,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

Maybe not. Jackson's decision may have more to do with the underlying values of the rapper's life; he may not consider 50 Cent's career, so often involving violent episodes, to be much of a role model. Role models are what \"Coach Carter,\" Jackson's new film, is all about. He plays Ken Carter, who began as a sports star at Richmond (California) High School, setting records that still stand, and then had success in the military and as a small businessman. He's asked to take over as basketball coach, an unpaid volunteer position; the former coach tells him, \"I can't get them to show up for school.\" Ken Carter thinks he can fix that. The movie was directed by Thomas Carter (\"Save the Last Dance\"), no relation to the coach. It follows long-established genre patterns; it's not only a sports movie with the usual big games and important shots, but also a coach movie, with inspiring locker room speeches and difficult moral decisions. There are certain parallels with \"Friday Night Lights,\" although there it's the movie itself, and not the coach, that underlines the futility of high school stars planning on pro sports as a career. Certainly both movies give full weight to public opinion in the communities where they're set -- places where the public's interest in secondary education seems entirely focused on sports, where coaches are more important than teachers, where scores are more important than grades.","Jaccard Noise_40":0.0,"Cosine Noise_40":0.2115707099,"EM Noise_40":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":0,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"Aundre Dean","Noise_60 Document Index":"7","Noise_60 Document":"Aundre Dean plays Carter High School defensive back Derric Evans in the movie Carter High.

Successive prompts and replies, known as prompt engineering, are taken into account at each stage of the conversation as a context.[2]  ChatGPT is built upon GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, from OpenAI's proprietary series of foundational GPT models, fine-tuned for conversational applications using a combination of supervised and reinforcement learning techniques.[3] ChatGPT was released as a freely available research preview, but due to its popularity, OpenAI now operates the service on a freemium model. It allows users on its free tier to access the GPT-3.5 based version, while the more advanced GPT-4 based version, as well as priority access to newer features, are provided to paid subscribers under the commercial name \"ChatGPT Plus\".  By January 2023, it had become what was then the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users and contributing to OpenAI's valuation growing to US$29 billion.[4][5] Within months, Google, Baidu, and Meta accelerated the development of their competing products: Bard, Ernie Bot, and LLaMA.","Jaccard Noise_80":1.0,"Cosine Noise_80":0.9816135168,"EM Noise_80":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":1,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"March 1, 2023.","Noise_100 Document Index":"5","Noise_100 Document":"Rich visuals mean pictures for now, but later can include maps, charts and other items.

Hence, on July 1, MLB announced that the St. Louis Cardinals would replace the Yankees for the game.[2] After several St. Louis players and coaches tested positive for COVID-19 in late July, MLB postponed several Cardinals games, eventually leading the league to announce on August 3 that the MLB at Field of Dreams game would be postponed to the 2021 season.","Jaccard Noise_60":1.0,"Cosine Noise_60":0.9952245951,"EM Noise_60":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_60":1,"Noise_80 Predicted Answer":"Dyersville, IA:","Noise_80 Document Index":"8","Noise_80 Document":"Traveler & Travel Advisor Reviews: 4.9 out of 5 stars\u00a0\u00a0  Menu                                 1-800-465-1765                                                       Get Custom Quote                      Dyersville, IA: August 10-12, 2022  MLB Field of Dreams Game Due to planned construction at the Dyersville venue, there is no Field of Dreams Game scheduled for 2023.

The company has announced that it will unveil the new CPU line in a YouTube livestream on August 29th at 7PM. The event will share more about the new Zen 4 architecture and the supporting AM5 platform. There are already some clues as to what to expect. AMD inadvertently shared some of the first Ryzen 7000 model numbers on its website in July, including one Ryzen 5 chip (7600X), one Ryzen 7 variant (7700X) and two Ryzen 9 releases (7900X and 7950X). As with past launches, the company appears focused on gaming-friendly enthusiast CPUs while leaving budget parts for later releases. Zen 4 and AM5, meanwhile, promise meaningful architectural changes. You'll see more Level 2 cache, boost speeds beyond 5GHz, AI hardware acceleration and support for newer standards like DDR5 memory and PCIe 5.0 expansion. AMD claimed a 15 percent boost to single-threaded performance in early testing. Effectively, AMD is responding to Intel's 12th-gen Core \u2014 it's just a question of whether or not Ryzen 7000 is fast enough to keep up or edge ahead.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.3333333333,"Cosine Noise_0":0.9852964282,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":0,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Monday,","Noise_20 Document Index":"1","Noise_20 Document":"When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission.

AMD unveiled its Ryzen 7000 series of desktop processors on Monday, with enormous increases over its predecessors in performance, clock speed, and (in some cases) power. But AMD\u2019s top-end 7950X will also be priced at $699, which is also $100 less than the price of the Ryzen 5950X when it debuted in late 2020.

Ryzen 7000 is the first of AMD\u2019s 5nm processors, and also the first to use its new AM5 motherboard socket. Enthusiasts will have to buy new motherboards to fit the new processors, in other words, but AMD has signaled that it hopes AM5\u2019s longevity will rival the record-breaking endurance of the AM4 socket used by all previous Ryzen processors to this point.

The chip houses two gold-colored 5nm core chiplets, each sporting eight cores. AMD says these are based on an optimized version of TSMC's high-performance 5nm process technology called N5, and they are placed much closer together than we've seen with previous Ryzen core chiplets. In addition, we see what appears to be a shim between the two core chiplets, likely to maintain an even surface atop the two dies. It is also possible that this close orientation is due to some type of advanced packaging interconnect between the two chips.  We can also see a clear outline around the top of each CCD, but we aren't sure if this is from a new metallization technique. We do know that the gold color is due to Backside Metallization (BSM), which includes an Au coating to prevent oxidation while improving TIM adhesion and lowering thermal impedance. We also see quite a few empty spots for capacitors, which is interesting and could imply heftier designs down the road.

In the first quarter, Tesla posted its lowest quarterly gross profit margin in two years. \"The market wants to see that Tesla management has a tangible plan to boost automotive gross margins and companywide operating profit margins over the coming quarters and in the next year or so,\" said Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein. \"I also think the market wants to see a growth plan that does not involve continuous price cuts.\" Musk brushed aside those fears on Wednesday, saying the company this year would likely achieve full self driving and that would be a big profit generator. Musk has missed his previous targets to achieve self-driving capability, dating back years. Tesla now sells the FSD software, which does not make the vehicle autonomous, for $15,000. That is almost a third of the roughly $47,000 current starting price of the base Model Y in the United States. \"We're the only ones making cars that technically, we could sell for zero profit for now and then yield actually tremendous economics in the future through autonomy,\" he told analysts on a conference call on Wednesday. \"I'm not sure how many people will appreciate the profundity of what I've just said, but it is extremely significant.\" Skeptics remain over how soon Tesla will launch FSD.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.9799962044,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"$15,000.","Noise_20 Document Index":"3","Noise_20 Document":"Keiron Berndt | Capital One  Article QuickTakes: Tesla has raised the price of its\u00a0Full Self-Driving (FSD) feature set again, this time to $15,000.

Believe it or not, Henry was terrified of thunderstorms until he was seven years old.  That's when his cousin took him outside during a storm (highly advise against that now) and explained to him what was causing all of the scary noise.  It was from that point that his fear became a fascination and now a career! While a junior in high school in Memphis, Henry began shadowing the weather team at CBS affiliate WREG-TV.

Stollings attorney, Peter Ginsberg, told USA Today that she is interested in coaching again, which served as her motivation to settle instead of waiting for the trial.\u00a0 \"Given the nature of university athletics, most if not all colleges were reticent to engage Marlene while her litigation was continuing against Texas Tech,'' Ginsberg said. \"Now that the litigation is over, the landscape is expected to change significantly.'' However, not everyone is happy with the decision. Some of Stollings' former players told USA Today that they did not wish to see her coach again.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.1846115738,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

In rather tedious news, Tencent and Sony Interactive Entertainment have acquired partial stakes in FromSoftware. More specifically, Tencent has 16.25% of shares and Sony Interactive Entertainment has 14.09% of shares in FromSoftware. The reason why this is boring is that Kadokawa is still the main owner (with 69.66% of the shares) and these new share acquisitions are both non-controlling stakes. In short, nothing has changed and neither Tencent nor Sony have any real decision-making power here. So if you were thinking that Sony would be able to force platform exclusivity for all future FromSoftware titles, then you would be wrong. This will just be business as usual, except that FromSoftware may have some more capital to play around with. One potentially interesting point here is that the money accrued from this will help FromSoftware bolster its publishing plans for the future. This is noteworthy because FromSoftware actually publishes its own games in Japan, so moving that to be more of a global endeavor would be better for all concerned. In that, in the past many of FromSoftware\u2019s games were released internationally by publishers that neither cared nor understood their games. The results were that FromSoftware\u2019s games were given no real international PR or marketing, and the localizations of these games were often thoroughly terrible as well.","Jaccard Noise_40":0.25,"Cosine Noise_40":0.5630176067,"EM Noise_40":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":1,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"Tencent and Sony Interactive Entertainment","Noise_60 Document Index":"1","Noise_60 Document":"Sep 1, 2022 ...

Speaking to ESPN commentator Mary Joe Fernandez on the court moments after the match, Williams said \u201cyou never know\u201d if she might reconsider her plan to stop playing. Asked later if that meant she had left herself some wiggle room to come back, she joked, \u201cI always did love Australia,\u201d where she won seven of her 23 Grand Slam singles titles.

{"Query":"Who is the head coach of Virginia Tech football?","Correct Answer":["Brent Pry"],"Noise_0 Predicted Answer":"Brent Pry","Noise_0 Document Index":"8","Noise_0 Document":"Virginia QB Brennan Armstrong is hit and loses the ball, but teammate Bobby Haskins is able to dive on it in the end zone for a safety. (1:10) Penn State defensive coordinator Brent Pry has been named the new head football coach at Virginia Tech, the Hokies announced Tuesday. Pry, 51, replaces former Hokies coach Justin Fuente, who was out as Hokies coach as of Nov. 16 after his teams went 43-31 in six seasons. Pry returns to Blacksburg, where he served as a defensive graduate assistant for the Hokies from 1995 to 1997 under head coach Frank Beamer and defensive coordinator Bud Foster. \"On behalf of Amy and our family, we are extremely grateful to President [Timothy] Sands and [athletic director] Whit [Babcock] for extending us this opportunity at Virginia Tech,\" Pry said in a statement released by the school. \"Working for Coach Beamer and Coach Foster as a graduate assistant in the 1990s, I was privileged to have been a part of this program as the Hokies established themselves as a national power, consistently proving they could beat anyone in the nation. \"Even after I departed Blacksburg, I always continued to appreciate Virginia Tech, its great players, its championship teams, and its wonderful traditions from afar. The resources, facilities, university backing of Athletics, and phenomenal fan support that Virginia Tech enjoys made this a very desirable situation.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":1.0,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Brent Pry","Noise_20 Document Index":"2","Noise_20 Document":"Filed under: He is even below Tony Elliott.  Everyone knew Brent Pry had a tough job ahead of him when he accepted the head-coaching position at Virginia Tech in December 2021. Under the previous regime, the Hokies had fallen off, lacked talent across the entire roster and left broken relationships with high schools throughout the state. Pry went to work, helping close on a solid class for 2022. If you have a Twitter account, you\u2019d see each of Pry\u2019s assistants hitting the road at every open period, visiting high schools throughout the recruiting footprint, whether those schools had recruitable prospects or not.  But Pry knew he needed to win. And unfortunately, the Hokies didn\u2019t do a lot of winning in 2022. Tech had its worst season since 1992 last fall, finishing 3-8, with the last game of the season against Virginia canceled.  A seven-game losing streak is what most will remember from last season. While some of those losses were ugly, Tech did show improvement but unfortunately blew late leads against N.C. State, Miami and Georgia Tech.  Heading into 2023, there is optimism surrounding the Hokies. While no one is expecting Virginia Tech to win the ACC, the Hokies were active in the NCAA transfer portal, adding talent at quarterback, running back, wide receiver, offensive line, defensive end, and in the secondary.","Jaccard Noise_20":1.0,"Cosine Noise_20":1.0,"EM Noise_20":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":1,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"Brent Pry","Noise_40 Document Index":"3","Noise_40 Document":"Nov 30, 2021 ...

So, with more games across more rounds, what is the schedule for the expanded CFP going to look like? And how exactly will the new format work?

So the upcoming 2023 campaign will still feature a four-team CFP field. Under the new format, the six highest-ranked conference champions will receive automatic bids. The field will then be filled out with the six highest-ranked teams remaining. The four highest-ranked conference champions receive a first-round bye to the quarterfinals.

The $400 million fine would be the second-largest issued to a tech company for a violation of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, behind Amazon's record-setting $888 million fine in 2021.","Jaccard Noise_40":0.75,"Cosine Noise_40":0.8984709978,"EM Noise_40":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":1,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"405 million euros, or just over $400 million,","Noise_60 Document Index":"5","Noise_60 Document":"Sep 6, 2022 ...

In June 2023, the series was canceled after one season,[1] and aired its final episode on June 27, 2023.  In the wake of Bruce Wayne's death, his adopted son Turner Hayes forges an unlikely alliance with runaways Harper and Cullen Row, and the criminal Duela, when they are all framed for the murder and publicly accused of committing it by the Gotham City Police Department and District Attorney Harvey Dent. The four youths attempt to clear their names and find out who really killed Bruce Wayne, with help from Turner's friend Stephanie Brown and Turner's classmate Carrie Kelley, who secretly operates as Robin. The mystery of who framed them soon leads to the Court of Owls.[2] Over time, they evolve into becoming Gotham's new protectors known as the \"Gotham Knights\".  In December 2021, it was reported that a television series adaptation was in development at The CW.

He courted unpopularity by denouncing both sides in the First World War as equally culpable, and although not a republican, castigated British policy on Ireland in the postwar period. These stances had no lasting effect on his standing or productivity as a dramatist; the inter-war years saw a series of often ambitious plays, which achieved varying degrees of popular success.

Just like before, the new model increases the screen size of the standard one, but keeps the majority of the other technical features in place. It fits in that awkward space between the cheaper iPhone 14 and the slightly more expensive, but superior Pro model. But is there any real reason to buy it? The iPhone 14 Plus is wider, taller, and heavier than the iPhone 14, and the only dimension that stays the same is the thickness at 7.8mm. Made from aluminum and glass, it\u2019s a step down in luxury from the stainless steel and glass Pro models, but with this comes the advantage of low weight. At 203 grams, the iPhone 14 Plus can\u2019t be called light, but it\u2019s lighter than the iPhone 14 Pro and only a few grams heavier than the Samsung Galaxy S22+. My usual iPhone of choice is the iPhone 14 Pro, and I\u2019ve been consistently surprised at how light the iPhone 14 Plus feels when I pick it up, despite the larger screen and body, as well as the scant 3-gram real-world difference between them.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.3333333333,"Cosine Noise_100":0.781891644,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

Everyone wants to be a hero. But what lengths might one go to get there? This is the winsome yet disturbing journey at the center of Susie Searches.\u00a0 Kiersey Clemons stars as Susie Wallis, a socially awkward college student with a mind for solving mysteries. Naturally, she has her own true crime podcast called Susie Searches, so when fellow student\/meditation influencer Jesse (Alex Wolff) goes missing, her interest in cracking the case isn't exactly selfless. If she finds the internet-adored victim, she and her podcast could score the validation she desperately craves. Whether she's squeezing the sheriff (Jim Gaffigan) for clues, eying a convenient creep (Ken Marino) as a suspect, or scouting out evidence, Susie is on a mission to save the day\u2026and promote herself.\u00a0 Forget the hardscrabble detectives of film noir; Susie has more in common with Oliver Putnam than she does Sam Spade. Rather than a gun and a trench coat, she carries a big smile smacked with colorful braces and a disarming demeanor that tends to make people underestimate her.

A film like Susie Searches demands a star turn, high voltage, explosively quirky nerdery and histrionics. Think Flick, Nicole Kidman in To Die For, or either lead in Agnieszka Smoczynska\u2019s recent The Silent Twins. Clemons is mute, blank, inexpressive, bored, taciturn, seeming even resentful of being there.  Wolff clearly dislikes the type of zoomer he\u2019s portraying, delivering a good deal of his lines with embarrassed insecurity. The film is not a failure in toto, but its failure to launch can only be credited to Kargman. The edit is the film\u2019s most disastrous component, frequently cutting away from critical reactions and lingering too long on silence, stillness, and useless moments of transition. Kargman knew what type of movie she wanted to make, and she more or less made one. All the parts are there, yet the intrepid detective still struggles to understand how they connect.

The state funeral for the late monarch, held on Sept. 19, was the first in the U.K. since that of former Prime Minister Winston Churchill in 1965. The occasion, attended by world leaders and dignitaries, followed 10 days of national mourning after the queen died at age 96 on Sept. 8 after 70 years on the throne. Hundreds of thousands of people were drawn to London\u2019s Westminster Hall to see the United Kingdom\u2019s longest-serving monarch lying in state.

Here\u2019s how it works Home \/ Features \/ Google Pixel Watch 2: the features we want from a smartwatch successor  The first Pixel Watch was a solid start - but there's room for improvement Android fans had a lot to like about the Google Pixel Watch when it landed in October 2022: a minimal design, slick Fitbit integration, and the best version of the firm\u2019s Wear OS software to date. Google\u2019s first wearable effort wasn\u2019t perfect, though. Battery life was a real downer, and the \u201cone size fits all\u201d approach was off-kilter with the rest of the smartwatch world. That leaves plenty of areas for a Pixel Watch 2 to improve upon. At the time of writing there\u2019s still a fairly long wait before a successor is set to turn up \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t look to the future, or come up with a laundry list of things we\u2019d like to see make the cut by the time it does. Google hasn\u2019t said anything official about a second Pixel Watch. At the annual I\/O event in May 2023, it quickly breezed over WearOS to leave more time to focus on AI, coding and other upcoming hardware like the Pixel Fold smartphone. The only info we have to go on right now is a single tweet from prolific phone leaker EVleaks.","Jaccard Noise_60":0.3333333333,"Cosine Noise_60":0.6168011427,"EM Noise_60":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_60":0,"Noise_80 Predicted Answer":"October 13, 2022,","Noise_80 Document Index":"0","Noise_80 Document":"EVs have been around a long time but are quickly gaining speed in the automotive industry.

Tetsuya Yamagami was arrested immediately after allegedly shooting Abe with a handmade gun as the former leader was making a campaign speech in July outside a train station in Nara in western Japan.  Later that month, Yamagami was sent to an Osaka detention center for a nearly six-month mental evaluation, which ended Tuesday. Yamagami is now back in police custody in Nara. Prosecutors said results of his mental evaluation showed he is fit to stand trial. Yamagami was also charged with violating a gun control law, according to the Nara District Court. Police have said Yamagami told them that he killed Abe, one of Japan\u2019s most influential and divisive politicians, because of Abe\u2019s apparent links to a religious group that he hated. In his statements and in social media postings attributed to him, Yamagami said he developed a grudge because his mother had made massive donations to the Unification Church that bankrupted his family and ruined his life. One of his lawyers, Masaaki Furukawa, told the Associated Press on Thursday that Yamagami was in good health during his mental evaluation in Osaka when he was only allowed to see his sister and three lawyers.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":1.0000001192,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Tetsuya Yamagami,","Noise_20 Document Index":"4","Noise_20 Document":"By\u00a0         Shauneen Miranda                        Former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's assassination resulted from an extremely rare act of gun violence in the country.

House of the Dragon is down to its final four episodes, and should the series continue to release on a weekly basis, the rest of the season should air as follows: Though Alicent and Rhaenyra were at the center of Episode 6, the marriage between Daemon (Matt Smith) and Laena resulted in the fiery death of House Velaryon\u2019s eldest daughter.

In the latest leadership contest, Mr Sunak racked up the support of his fellow MPs early, and fast. He crossed the 100 nominations he needed long before the deadline - including from MPs that had previously backed Truss or Boris Johnson. He clashed with the former PM during the previous leadership race, claiming her plan to borrow money during an inflation crisis was a \"fairytale\" that would plunge the economy into chaos. His parents came to the UK from east Africa and are both of Indian origin. Mr Sunak was born in Southampton in 1980, where his father was a GP and his mother ran a pharmacy. He went to the boarding school Winchester College, then studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Oxford, and business at Stanford in America. He is now the first British Asian prime minister. Mr Sunak was first elected as an MP in 2015 - for Richmond in north Yorkshire - but rose quickly, and was made finance minister - or chancellor - in February 2020 under Boris Johnson.

The era of huge budgets and endless hubris came to an end as the rent came due all at once.

For a teensy $6.99 per month, anyone can pay for a Netflix subscription \u2026 as long as they\u2019re willing to sit through a few commercials during playback.

Democrats\u2019 hold on the Senate is a blow to Republicans\u2019 high hopes of wresting away control of Congress in a midterm election that typically favors the party out of power. It was still unclear which party would control the House of Representatives as counting continued in razor-tight races in California and a smattering of other states. Cortez Masto, the\u00a0first Latina in the Senate, was considered the most vulnerable Democratic senator in the midterm elections, and the Republican Party had high hopes of flipping the seat.","Jaccard Noise_20":1.0,"Cosine Noise_20":1.0,"EM Noise_20":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":1,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"Catherine Cortez Masto","Noise_40 Document Index":"2","Noise_40 Document":"Nov 8, 2022 ...

In Nevada, Democrat Cisco Aguilar won the race to be the state's next secretary of state, the top election official. He defeated Jim Marchant, a Republican who supported Trump's false claim that he lost the 2020 election to Biden because of voter fraud. Democrats also defeated Republican candidates in Michigan and Arizona who had supported Trump's false claim and sought to be their state's top elections officials. Democrats got an important boost late on Friday when Kelly, the Democratic senator for Arizona, was projected to hold onto his seat, defeating Republican Blake Masters, who like Laxalt was endorsed by Trump. Masters has not conceded the race. \"We've seen the consequences that come when leaders refuse to accept the truth and focus more on conspiracies of the past than solving the challenges that we face today,\" Kelly, a former Navy combat pilot and astronaut, said in a short victory speech to his supporters in Phoenix on Saturday.

While little is known about the new Doctor, the BBC did announce that Millie Gibson has been cast as Ruby Sunday, the Doctor's new companion. Much attention has been paid to Tennant's return and Gatwa's casting, but Gibson is an exciting choice for the franchise. The companion is just as important for Doctor Who as the Doctor himself, so the person cast in the role takes on a big responsibility. At just 18 years old, she will be the youngest person to be cast as a companion and was only a one-year-old when the series was revived in 2005. Is the young star ready for such a major role? Her casting might be the key to understanding the new direction for the series. The Doctor's companion is an important role in the series, but this is a performance on a television series.

The Criminal Minds reboot's new title - Criminal Minds: Evolution - resolves one of its biggest problems. Paramount+ is bringing back FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit (BAU) to the small screen not long after the team wrapped up its run on CBS for 15 years. While the profilers will miss a couple of their co-workers such as Matthew Gray Gubler's Spencer Reid and Daniel Henney's Matt Simmons, the rest of the squad will be intact as they track down a network of UnSubs which was established during the coronavirus pandemic. Many aspects of the original Criminal Minds run will stay the same, but Evolutions has some fresh aspects, including a new title. Retitling Paramount+'s Criminal Minds revival as Criminal Minds: Evolution is appropriate given this new version of the show. The project is a continuation of its CBS run, so technically, it isn't really a \"reboot\" as it has usually been referred to. The cast remains the same and its events take place in the same continuity. Instead of calling it Criminal Minds season 16, however, giving it a different title allows it to separate itself from the CBS procedural without totally severing its ties with it. It also hints that everything in Criminal Minds: Evolution is an evolved version of the original show, which seems to be the case.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.3333333333,"Cosine Noise_0":0.3522495031,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Criminal Minds: Evolution.","Noise_20 Document Index":"4","Noise_20 Document":"By subscribing, I agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.

Here\u2019s what we know so far.  \u201cSince the first little girl ever existed, there have been dolls,\u201d a voice narrates in the opening shot in the first teaser trailer for Barbie, which came out in December 2022. The camera pans over little girls sitting desolately in a desert. \u201cBut the dolls were always and forever baby dolls, until \u2026\u201d Enter Robbie, who appears as a giant first iteration of the Mattel doll from 1959, complete with a pin-up ponytail and a black-and-white striped swimsuit. In a trailer released in April 2023, a firm plot for the film still seemed to be under wraps, but there were hints at trouble in paradise for Barbie (Margot Robbie) and Ken (Ryan Gosling). Barbie seems to want some independence and space, while Ken is being quite clingy.

When Democrats took control of the House in 2019, Pelosi moved the loan-program bill through the House. But it was dead on arrival in the Senate, where then-Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., opposed the costly fix. Then, when Democrats won power in the Senate in January on the strength of a pair of run-off election victories in Georgia, the dynamics of the pension issue changed dramatically. Instead of asking unions to address their pension liabilities through a loan program, Democrats saw an opportunity to inject tens of billions of dollars of relief into the multiemployer pensions to keep them solvent for the next few decades. Biden, who framed much of his campaign around rebuilding unions as a path to strengthening the middle class, was on board. Hoffa spoke to him repeatedly about the issue during the 2020 election cycle. \"He said 'I'll be there,'\" Hoffa said. \"He was very well aware of it.\" But Democrats hold very thin margins in the House and Senate.

Doha (AFP) \u2013 Morocco will have the backing of an entire continent when they attempt to become Africa's first World Cup semi-finalists by beating Portugal on Saturday, said coach Walid Regragui.         Issued on: 09\/12\/2022 - 14:38Modified: 09\/12\/2022 - 14:36 The North Africans will take on Portugal at Al Thumama Stadium as the first Arab nation to reach the last eight after beating Spain on penalties in the last 16. A World Cup semi-final against either England or France is up for grabs, alongside a place in the history books. Cameroon in 1990, Senegal's 2002 side and the 2010 Ghana team all fell at the quarter-final stage. \"We have nothing to lose. The challenge is to do as well as we did in the previous games,\" Regragui said on the eve of the match against Portugal. \"We want to show that Africa deserves to be here, Morocco deserves to be here. \"We have a whole people behind us, a continent behind us and the Arab world behind us.

For a continent comprising 54 member nations, it only gets five slots, and that, too, only since 1998. In comparison, Europe, with 55 eligible nations, gets 13, and South America, with only 10 nations, gets between four and five. From a purely probabilistic standpoint, this severely reduces Africa\u2019s odds of making an impression.\u00a0It also means Africa\u2019s World Cup qualification is one of the most difficult to negotiate. In the late 2000s, Egypt bizarrely failed to make the 2006 and 2010 editions, despite winning three straight Africa Cups of Nations and defeating Italy at the 2009 Confederations Cup. This year, Nigeria and Ivory Coast, both multiple African champions, will miss out in addition to Egypt and Algeria. Following his side\u2019s elimination from the reckoning, South Africa coach Hugo Broos voiced a popular sentiment on the continent: \u201cIt is not fair, it is easier for good teams in Europe to qualify for the World Cup than [good teams] in Africa.\u201d Broos told SA newspaper The Citizen. Cameroon, Morocco, Senegal, Tunisia and Ghana will represent Africa at Qatar World Cup. All five have appeared at football\u2019s biggest event previously.

Ghana in 2010 came even closer to the semi-finals than their two predecessors. They were the only African team to get through the groups that year, and just as it did with Cameroon and Senegal their round-of-16 game went to extra time \u2014 where Asamoah Gyan scored the winner against the United States. In the quarter-final against Uruguay, with the scores tied at 1-1 in the 120th minute, Luis Suarez deliberately handled the ball on the line to deny Ghana a goal. He was sent off but Gyan, under unbearable pressure, hit the bar from the resulting penalty and let Uruguay off the hook.

The South American teams performed strongly, with all five advancing to the round of 16 (four as group winners), and four further advancing to the quarter-finals. However, only Uruguay advanced to the semi-finals.  Of the six African teams, only Ghana advanced to the round of 16. South Africa became the first host nation in World Cup history to be eliminated in the first round, despite beating France and drawing with Mexico, while Ghana and Ivory Coast were the only other African teams to win a match. The overall performance of the African teams, in the first World Cup to be hosted on the continent, was judged as disappointing by observers such as Cameroon great Roger Milla.[75]  Only six out of the thirteen UEFA teams advanced to the round of 16, a record low since the introduction of this stage in 1986.","Jaccard Noise_80":0.0,"Cosine Noise_80":0.2124895155,"EM Noise_80":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":0,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"the Black Stars of Ghana","Noise_100 Document Index":"7","Noise_100 Document":"So one reason Africa is yet to win a World Cup is that it has barely been participating. Some might point to poor results in the last 12 years, but who is to say that increased participation would not have led to increased competition and improvement?  The prize money for simply participating in the World Cup could have been injected into grassroots football around the continent, significantly improving the quality of play. Nearly a century after the inaugural World Cup was hosted in Uruguay, Africa will finally be awarded a more equitable number of places, when we will have 9.5 places in 2026 - inching us a bit closer to global parity. The 2022 World Cup has also shown us that a lack of representation, not only in the form of qualification slots, but also in the form of hosting rights, can be extremely influential.  South Korea made the semi-finals in 2002 when they co-hosted the tournament, while the Black Stars of Ghana were a penalty-kick away from the semi-finals in 2010 in Africa's first World Cup in South Africa.  Is it merely a coincidence that Africa and Asia's best ever finishes came the only time the continents have hosted the tournaments? The 2022 World Cup has shown us that the answer is: probably not.  Three Asian sides qualified for the knockout stages this year, and the Qatar World Cup has been, by far, the most successful tournament ever on the pitch for African countries.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.4111588895,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

Amid what he described as a listening tour of college sports stakeholders that already has been underway and will continue during his first 100 days, Baker did not dismiss out of hand the concept of college athletes becoming employees of their school. He also did not adhere to the idea that the association\u2019s only path to clarifying its most urgent underlying issues is the passage of new federal laws. Those notions have been articles of faith for Emmert and many other college sports leaders as Emmert\u2019s more-than-12-year run with the NCAA has been drawing to a close. His departure also ends an era in which the association has been led on a permanent basis by either a former college president or former college sports administrator. In addition to his background in politics, Baker enters from the worlds of business, healthcare and government administration. He played basketball for Harvard, his wife was a gymnast for Northwestern and his sons played Division III football. \u00a0 He inherits an association facing\u00a0pressure on numerous sides regarding the environment surrounding college athletes\u2019 dealings to make money from their name, image and likeness.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.9999998808,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Charlie Baker","Noise_20 Document Index":"5","Noise_20 Document":"Mar 14, 2023 ...

The company has also faced criticism for its handling of the situation and the toxic work environment that allegedly exists within the company. This has resulted in significant public backlash, with some fans and employees calling for boycotts and protests. Alegre\u2019s departure from Activision to Yuga Labs may be seen as a positive move for those who are critical of Activision\u2019s leadership and culture. It\u2019s worth noting that the gaming industry and the NFT space have both been the subject of intense scrutiny and controversy in recent years. The allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination at Activision Blizzard have been a particularly significant source of controversy in the gaming industry. Meanwhile, the NFT space has faced criticism for its environmental impact and the high levels of speculation and price volatility surrounding some NFTs. Furthermore, the recent fake news surrounding Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) highlights the need for responsible and informed reporting in the NFT space.

By the end of 2023, Zack Snyder will be back behind the camera for Rebel Moon. The fan-favorite director will test his skills in an epic space opera heading to Netflix later this year. Here\u2019s all the information we know about the Rebel Moon release date. Netflix set the Rebel Moon release date for December 22, 2023. One of the most-anticipated movies in 2023, Rebel Moon was penned by Snyder, Shay Hatten, and Kurt Johnstad. Snyder has directed many movies that can be labeled as sci-fi, proof is his long commitment to the DC Universe superheroes in what was nicknamed the \u201cSnyderverse.\u201d However, Space Moon will be his first space opera. The 57-year-old director started his partnership with Netflix with 2021\u2019s Army of the Dead, a zombie movie that featured an epic heist.  Inspired by Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa and Star Wars, Rebel Moon follows a peaceful colony dealing with an oppressive regent. Still, many details are under wrap, and the movie hasn\u2019t even got a trailer. Yet, Netflix believes so very much in the Rebel Moon potential of the film that a sequel is being filmed back-to-back. Originally, Snyder approached Lucasfilm with his story, but the project never sailed there. Instead, it took the current form after the involvement of producer Eric Newman.","Jaccard Noise_40":0.6666666667,"Cosine Noise_40":0.841422081,"EM Noise_40":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":1,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"Dec. 22","Noise_60 Document Index":"3","Noise_60 Document":"Rebel Moon hits Netflix on Dec. 22 \u2014 and Part Two will follow soon after.

The decrease in goods primarily reflected decreases in food and beverages as well as motor vehicles and parts that were partly offset by increases in recreational goods and vehicles and \"other\" nondurable goods (mainly pharmaceuticals). The increase in exports reflected increases in both goods and services. The increase in private inventory investment primarily reflected increases in manufacturing, wholesale trade, and retail trade industries.

Or will the fee factor simply not amount to much when some stars have already treated transfers like a prep portal? \u201cHopefully, we can make all of our schools as good as we can be,\u201d Wilson said.

By Nico Grant and Cade Metz Nico Grant and Cade Metz reported this story in San Francisco. For more than three months, Google executives have watched as projects at Microsoft and a San Francisco start-up called OpenAI have stoked the public\u2019s imagination with the potential for artificial intelligence. But on Tuesday, Google tentatively stepped off the sidelines as it released a chatbot called Bard. The new A.I. chatbot will be available to a limited number of users in the United States and Britain and will accommodate additional users, countries and languages over time, Google executives said in an interview. The cautious rollout is the company\u2019s first public effort to address the recent chatbot craze driven by OpenAI and Microsoft, and it is meant to demonstrate that Google is capable of providing similar technology. But Google is taking a much more circumspect approach than its competitors, which have faced criticism that they are proliferating an unpredictable and sometimes untrustworthy technology. Still, the release represents a significant step to stave off a threat to Google\u2019s most lucrative business, its search engine.

In order to really figure out what this is and what it should be, we really need to do a lot of experiments.\" The unsettled nature of AI image technology is evident in the difference between tools like Midjourney and a downloadable open source graphics application like Blender, or a locally installed commercial application like Adobe Photoshop (before it became a cloud service). Midjourney exists in a social context. Its front-end is the chat service Discord. New users log in to Discord's Midjourney server and can then submit text prompts to generate images alongside numerous other users in any of the various newbie channels.

Pikmin 4 is set to launch for the Nintendo Switch on July 21 and marks the newest numbered entry in the real-time strategy series in over ten years, making its release quite the big deal for hardcore fans. Instead of playing as Captain Olimar (who most people know from Super Smash Bros. at this point) or any of his space explorer comrades, gamers will get to customize their own character (a series first). There are not too many options available, but it's still a step forward in terms of a character creator in a Nintendo first-party title. Pikmin 4 comes out in a couple of days and retails for $59.99, the same price as most other major games on the Switch. People who decided to pre-order the game digitally via the Switch eShop are probably wondering just when they'll be able to actually boot the game and start playing --that's where this guide comes into play.

The biggest revelation, though, is that the game will feature an adorable dog-like companion that can aid Captain Olimar. In the trailer, we see it dragging an item back to Olimar\u2019s ship all by itself, seemingly confirming that it has the power of 10 Pikmin. Elsewhere, we see it barreling into obstacles to open up new parts of the world. That aspect is a major departure for the series and should make it stand apart from previous entries.

{"Query":"What company acquired iRobot?","Correct Answer":["Amazon"],"Noise_0 Predicted Answer":"Amazon","Noise_0 Document Index":"3","Noise_0 Document":"A slew of home-cleaning robots adds to the company's tech arsenal, making it more involved in consumer's lives beyond static things like voice control. Amazon's Astro robot, which helps with tasks like setting an alarm, was unveiled last year at an introductory price of $1,000. But its rollout has been limited and has received a lackluster response. The company hasn't had much success with household robots, but the iRobot acquisition and the company's strong market reputation provide a \"massive foothold in the consumer robot market\" that could help Amazon replicate the success of its Echo line of smart speakers, said Lian Jye Su, a robotics industry analyst for ABI Research. Su said it also illustrates the shortcomings of consumer robotics vendors like iRobot, which struggled to expand beyond a niche product and was in a \"race-to-the-bottom\" competition with Korean and Chinese manufacturers offering cheaper versions of a robotic vacuum. On Friday, iRobot reported its quarterly results. Revenue plunged 30% primarily on order reductions and delays, and the company announced it was laying off 10% of its workforce. Amazon said it will acquire iRobot for $61 per share in an all-cash transaction that will include iRobot's net debt. The company has total current debt of approximately $332.1 million as of July 2. The deal is subject to approval by shareholders and regulators. Upon completion, iRobot's CEO, Colin Angle, will remain in his position.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":1.0,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Amazon","Noise_20 Document Index":"5","Noise_20 Document":"Since introducing the Roomba vacuum in 2002, iRobot has continued to delight customers with every product generation, saving customers valuable time previously spent on household chores    The team at iRobot has developed innovative cleaning products that customers love   SEATTLE & BEDFORD, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Today Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and iRobot (NASDAQ:IRBT) announced that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement under which Amazon will acquire iRobot. iRobot has a history of making customers\u2019 lives easier with innovative cleaning products for the home. iRobot has continued to innovate with every product generation, solving hard problems to help give customers valuable time back in their day. \u201cWe know that saving time matters, and chores take precious time that can be better spent doing something that customers love,\u201d said Dave Limp, SVP of Amazon Devices. \u201cOver many years, the iRobot team has proven its ability to reinvent how people clean with products that are incredibly practical and inventive\u2014from cleaning when and where customers want while avoiding common obstacles in the home, to automatically emptying the collection bin.

This year, that includes both hardware and software \u2014 and, as you might imagine, lots and lots of talk about AI. Here's everything you need to know.

He fired up Hinge, his preferred dating app, and swiped on a few interesting women. After receiving a couple of matches, he turned, out of curiosity, to a new AI dating tool called Rizz to break the ice. \u201cThere\u2019s some amount of mental work and barrier to thinking of how to compose a message [on a dating app],\u201d Lloyd said. \u201cIt\u2019s like getting started on a term paper.\u201d Rizz, which is meant to function as a digital wingman, helps users come up with killer opening lines and responses to potential matches. The company behind it is just one of many start-ups trying to transform romance through artificial intelligence by optimizing and automating online dating, now one of the primary ways by which people find romantic connections. Using dating apps can be a slog. Some people complain that they have to sift through countless matches as others indiscriminately swipe; it is difficult to start conversations with strangers; and many users end up viewing the apps more as a necessary chore than an exciting opportunity to connect with someone new.

Launched at Wednesday\u2019s\u00a0Google I\/O conference, the\u00a0Pixel Fold\u00a0is Google\u2019s first entry into the growing foldables category and comes with a 7.6-inch main display and a 5.8-inch external panel. Google touts this as the thinnest foldable in the markets where it will be sold, which include the US, UK, Germany and Japan. The company also rolled out its first Pixel-branded tablet and a $499 Pixel 7a, trickling down its\u00a02022 flagship phone\u2019s features to a more affordable price point. The three devices use an in-house chip known as the Tensor G2.\u00a0 The move into the pricier foldables category marks a strategy shift for Google, which has so far focused on undercutting the cost of rival devices. The Pixel Fold is Google\u2019s most expensive handset to date, matching the price of Samsung\u2019s latest\u00a0Galaxy Z Fold 4\u00a0and including high-end specifications like 512 gigabytes of onboard storage.

When I recently turned on Google\u2019s new Pixel Fold smartphone and unfolded it as if it were a book, it transformed into a miniature tablet, similar to an iPad Mini or an Amazon Fire. Then something unexpected happened. For the next few hours, I found it difficult to put the device down, as if I were sucked into a great novel. The phone\u2019s performance was smooth and fast, and the bigger screen made reading emails, watching videos and reading comic books more delightful than on a normal phone screen. I was surprised because I have been wary of foldable phones. The earliest models released by Samsung, Motorola and Huawei about four years ago had glaring flaws. They were thick and heavy, had durability issues and lacked software to take advantage of their novel hardware.

{"Query":"What is the name of Google's AI image editing tool?","Correct Answer":["Magic Editor"],"Noise_0 Predicted Answer":"Magic Editor","Noise_0 Document Index":"3","Noise_0 Document":"In addition to new smart devices, Google teased a new AI-enhanced Magic Editor tool at this year\u2019s annual I\/O conference. Though we only got a sneak peek, the results are impressive and prove that an era of advanced image manipulation for the masses isn\u2019t far off, thanks to AI. Of course, AI-powered image editing is nothing new for Google. Handy tools like the Magic Eraser, for removing unwanted distractions, and Photo Unblur, for enhancing soft\/blurred shots, have been around for several years. And Google has been leveraging AI to help organize and surface images in users\u2019 libraries since 2015. But the Magic Editor takes AI-enhanced manipulation a leap further. Not only can users select and edit subjects (similar to using a mask in Lightroom\/Capture One) but with a few taps of the screen you can easily scale and reposition subjects in the frame. The demo also shows the tool's ability to expand an image\u2019s composition through generative AI. Of course, the results aren\u2019t perfect. In the example with the balloons, for instance, the portion of the bench created using generative AI shows a noticeable red tint. Similarly, in the waterfall demo, the area under the subject\u2019s arm shows an obvious repeating pattern in the rocks. These criticisms aside, the power of this tool to dramatically reshape image editing on the fly can\u2019t be understated.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.9999998808,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Magic Editor,","Noise_20 Document Index":"4","Noise_20 Document":"By  Jay Peters, a news editor who writes about technology, video games, and virtual worlds.

Collectively, these modes aren't yet as revolutionary as the original Photoshop. Adobe also has enough of its own machine-learning wizardry to ensure its apps will remain essential among professionals for many years to come. But the big change is that Google's tools are both automatic and live in the places where non-photographers shoot and store their photos.\u00a0 For the average user of Google's phones or its cloud photo apps, that'll likely mean never having to dabble with a program like Photoshop again. Photo Unblur and Magic Eraser may look simple, but they're built on some powerful machine learning. Another related feature, Face Unblur, is so demanding that it can only run on Google's custom Tensor processor. Both modes do way more than crank up a sharpening slider. The complex process of building noise maps and applying 'polyblur' techniques was explained recently by Isaac Reynolds, Google's Product Manager for the Pixel camera, in a chat on the company's new 'Made by Google' podcast.  When asked about Photo Unblur and Face Unblur, Reynolds said: \"I think you've probably seen in the news all these websites now where you can type in a sentence and it produces an image, right?\".","Jaccard Noise_100":0.3333333333,"Cosine Noise_100":0.6205888987,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

Apple Vision Pro is priced starting at $3,499 and it is set to launch in early 2024. It will be available on Apple.com when it launches, and in stores only in the United States to begin with. Note: See an error in this roundup or want to offer feedback? Send us an email here. Apple Vision Pro is a \"mixed reality\" headset, meaning it can display both virtual and augmented reality content. It is not like augmented reality glasses, however, as it is designed to completely cover the eyes and block out all of your surroundings.   Apple is using exterior and interior cameras for the augmented reality component of the device.

However, in October 2022, the retailer introduced a second two-day sale event that year: \"Prime Early Access Sale.\" This gave Amazon Prime members another chance to score savings ahead of the Black Friday and Cyber Monday shopping weekend. A monthly Prime membership costs $14.99 a month, but you can also purchase an annual membership for $139, which ultimately saves you a few dollars a month. Additionally, college students can get a Prime membership for only $7.49 per month or $69 per year \u2014 and students who are new to Prime Student can sign up for a six-month trial.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.6666666667,"Cosine Noise_0":0.8918299079,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Tuesday, July 11,","Noise_20 Document Index":"2","Noise_20 Document":"We independently review everything we recommend.

Amazon said Prime members ordered more than 100 million items from merchants during the Early Access sale. Prime Day, which features deals on many products on Amazon.com, began in 2015 as a celebration of Amazon\u2019s 20th year in business. It turned into a summer sales holiday designed to drum up additional business for Amazon \u2014 and the retailer\u2019s marketplace sellers \u2014 before the holiday shopping season. In recent years, other large retailers have offered promotions on their own websites around Prime Day to take advantage of the additional online shoppers. Amazon Prime Day takes place in more than 20 countries, including: Digital Commerce 360 estimates Amazon\u2019s sales on Prime Day hit $12.09 billion globally during the manufactured retail holiday, which spanned July 12 and 13. That\u2019s up 8.1% year over year from the same shopping spree in 2021, which ran from June 21 through 22. In 2021, Prime Day sales reached $11.19 billion and represented a 7.7% increase over Amazon\u2019s 2020 event.   Prime Day 2021 fell less than a year after the 2020 sales event, which contributed to the slowdown in growth from 45.1% earlier in the pandemic. Amazon postponed Prime Day 2020, pushing it from its usual summer time slot to mid-October because of the coronavirus pandemic.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.25,"Cosine Noise_100":0.7900592089,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}
