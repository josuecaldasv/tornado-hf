It comes from in-house producer Jennie Snyder Urman, who created and executive produced Jane The Virgin. She currently serves as executive producer on the CW\u2019s Charmed and CBS\u2019s midseason sitcom Broke. The writer is Katie Wech, who previously worked with Urman as co-executive producer on Jane the Virgin. Prior to Good Sam, she wrote ABC's pilot The Hypnotist\u2019s Love Story, based on the Liane Moriarty book, which didn't make it to series for good reasons (read my script review). Most recently, she was one of the many writers hired for Fox\u2019s summer series BH90210. This is also the second year CBS has developed a drama pilot for Sophia Bush. In 2019, she headlined Surveillance, a suspenseful spy thriller (read my preview) which reportedly \"tested through the roof\" but was ultimately determined not to be a good fit for the network. Will Bush have better luck this time? Read on...

What microchip shortage? EV maker Tesla, which it should be pointed out produces its own chips in-house, seems not to have been bothered by supply-chain issues all that much in 2021, delivering 936,172 vehicles in the year just ended, according to a report by finance news outlet Finbold. That represents a healthy 87 percent increase over 2020, when the company handed over 499,550 Teslas to customers. Even better for the company, it ended the year with a bang, racking up a record number of sales in the last quarter of 2021, or 308,600 units. Most of that total consisted of Model 3 and Model Y models, no surprise. It\u2019s the sixth consecutive quarter that it breaks its record for sales. In 2019, the automaker delivered 367,500 units, so annual sales growth, while not exponential, is clearly accelerating. The company has said in the past that one its main goals is to attain 50 percent sales growth year after year. Once upon a time, Tesla struggled mightily to hit its delivery targets, but no more. There\u2019s also no sign of that growth slowing down any time soon, even as all-electric rivals join the market by the month. Projections made by Finbold put estimated sales for 2022 at over 1.5 million units, for an increase of close to 65 percent.

Speaking at the annual shareholder meeting, Elon Musk mentioned the company\u2019s future production plans, saying that by the end of 2022, Tesla might reach an annual production run rate of 2 million vehicles: \u201cWe\u2019re aiming to achieve a 2 million vehicle run-rate by the end of the year\u2026 Thanks to the hard work of the Tesla team, we\u2019ve already been able to achieve a 1.5 million unit annualized run rate. And depending on how the rest of this year goes, I think we might get close to, or will get approximately at the 1.5 million mark, and will be exiting the year at a 2 million-unit run-rate,\u201d Musk said.

And, once again, Tesla has demonstrated its remarkable capabilities. Despite lower car prices, the company managed to mitigate the already-expected decline in margins, showcasing Elon Musk\u2019s adeptness at steering the company through both prosperous and challenging times. Another noteworthy aspect is the positive evolution of Tesla\u2019s revenue mix, which bodes well for H2 \u2013 when we expect further margin contraction in the car sales department. With improvements in revenue from Energy and Services, Tesla gains greater flexibility to continue its strategy of offering competitive prices and driving more sales. While it\u2019s true that Tesla\u2019s recent rally may have been excessive in the short term, the overall trajectory of the company remains positive. Thus, investors should exercise caution before betting against Tesla, as it continues to exceed expectations and enhance its long-term prospects.\u201d While other automakers delivered their worst sales figures in a decade, Tesla\u2019s delivery statistics were praiseworthy in 2022. The company delivered 1,313,851 vehicles to customers worldwide and, in so doing, increased its deliveries by 40% in comparison to the previous year. It also produced 47% more cars in 2022 compared to 2021.

Former US President Donald Trump's social media app, Truth Social, is now available to download from Apple's App Store. It was launched on February 21st, 2022, which is President\u2019s Day in the US. Immediately upon launching, the app reached the number one spot on the App Store's Top Charts. Truth Social came about following Trump's bans from various social media platforms---including Facebook and Twitter---in 2021. These platforms removed Trump due to concerns around his public comments following the Capitol Hill riots in January 2021. Before getting himself banned from various social media platforms, Trump built up huge followings.

Regulators are seeking to ax the deal because they say it will hurt competition. U.S. District Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley said in a ruling that the \u201cFTC has not shown a likelihood it will prevail on its claim this particular vertical merger in this specific industry may substantially lessen competition. To the contrary, the record evidence points to more consumer access to Call of Duty and other Activision content.\u201d Microsoft appeared to have the upper hand in a 5-day San Francisco court hearing that ended late last month. The proceeding showcased testimony by Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella and longtime Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick, who both pledged to keep Activision\u2019s blockbuster game Call of Duty available to people who play it on consoles \u2014 particularly Sony\u2019s PlayStation \u2014 that compete with Microsoft\u2019s Xbox.

That means Nadella sees an opportunity for many software makers to create many different virtual worlds in the future, instead of one dominant company controlling most of the activity. Still, Microsoft does not yet have an affordable, consumer-grade virtual reality headset that would be necessary to fulfill the vision for the metaverse. Microsoft does sell an augmented reality headset called HoloLens, but that device paints digital items on top of the real world. It's not a fully immersive experience and is mostly used for business applications. In an interview with CNBC's Becky Quick on \"Squawk on the Street,\" Kotick said the deal came through after he realized Microsoft had the technology to push Activision forward in the burgeoning competition between tech companies to build the metaverse. In the same interview, Spencer said talks about an acquisition began between the two companies late last year. That said, both companies focused on the present in announcing the deal, with a highlight on Activision's strength in mobile gaming.

While millions of people will be tuning into the intense NFL action between the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles, a large sum will be even more excited for the iconic commercials. The cost for a 30-second commercial during this year\u2019s Super Bowl is reaching a record-high amount, with advertisers hoping their ad makes a bang for the viewers. Ahead of the game, let\u2019s take a look at the costs of a Super Bowl commercial in 2023 and more history about the big game day ads: In 2023, a 30-second Super Bowl commercial costs a record-high average of $7 million, according to Forbes.

Here were the prices in some recent previous years:\u00a0 Connecting you to your favorite North Texas sports teams as well as sports news around the globe. There's a reason commercials during the Super Bowl have to refer to the event as the \"Big Game\" rather than \"Super Bowl LVII.\" The reason is that the term has been a registered NFL trademark since 1969, requiring commercials, radio hosts and other specific media personnel to pay to use the official name.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.9999999404,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"$6.5 million","Noise_20 Document Index":"0","Noise_20 Document":"The decline in automotive ads this year comes as companies invest billions of dollars in electric vehicles or attempt to preserve cash in preparation for a potential economic downturn.

Newer automakers have also traditionally advertised less, or not at all, as they attempt to emulate Tesla's advertising-free model, Haggstrom said.

Its head Alex Kipman dismissed the rumors on Twitter without denying that Hololens 3 had been discontinued. Now the website has published another report with new insider information about Microsoft's augmented reality future plans. The source claims to know the company's product roadmap and calls Kipman's account of the situation \"complete bullshit.\" Project Calypso, the codename under which Hololens 3 was being developed, has definitely been stopped, he says. \"All of the people who were working on it have been distributed to other programs or have left the company,\" the source said. Microsoft could take Hololens 2 and release a new version with minor improvements, but that would no longer be Calypso. The AR glasses should have been a standalone Windows-based device like its two predecessors, but more robust, with longer battery life and with the ability to be worn outdoors. Microsoft had discontinued Project Calypso in order to devote the freed-up resources to other projects, including Project Bondi, which it was pushing with Samsung.

This marks the first-ever Spanish broadcast on broadcast television. Both sides rarely win a trade, but that was the case here. The Pepsi Twitter account announced on September 30 that the 2022 Super Bowl halftime show will consist of the likes of Eminem, Mary J. Blige, Kendrick Lamar, Dr. Dre, and Snoop Dogg. The Weeknd performed at Super Bowl LV, and Shakira and Jennifer Lopez performed the year prior.

Which teams are currently favorites in each conference to play in (and win) the Super Bowl next season? Weirdly, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers don\u2019t hold the best odds of winning the Super Bowl in 2022. Their previous Super Bowl opponent has better odds, despite Tampa Bay returning all 22 starters from their Super Bowl squad. The Buccaneers are currently +600 to win it all in 2022, according to Vegas Insider. Behind the Buccaneers in the NFC are the Green Bay Packers (+1300), the San Francisco 49ers (+1400), and the Los Angeles Rams (+1400). Despite losing Super Bowl LV, the Chiefs head into 2022 as Super Bowl favorites. It\u2019s not wild to assume they get back there, given they\u2019ve been to the previous three conference championships and the last two Super Bowls.

Original story: Following its official free-to-play launch on February 11, Lost Ark has already become Steam's second most-played game of all time by concurrent players with an all-time peak of 1,325,305 people. As revealed by SteamDB, Lost Ark passed Counter-Strike: Global Offensive's all-time peak of 1,308,963 players to secure the #2 spot. Considering these all-time peaks tend to happen around a game's release, it may be quite an uphill battle to take down PUBG's record of 3,257,248 players at one time.

The game quickly grew a sizeable fanbase in that region thanks to its PvP mechanics, extensive content offerings, cinematic style, and all those other MMO tropes that usually encourage people to gleefully spend a few hundred hours of their lives playing them.  So, while Lost Ark has been playable in South Korea and other regions for quite some time, those in the West who recently pre-ordered any of the Lost Ark Founder\u2019s Pack on Steam were also able to start playing the game yesterday (February 8). You\u2019re still able to start playing the game right now if you decide to buy a Founder\u2019s Pack for the MMO via Steam (each of which comes with a variety of in-game rewards as well as early access to the title).","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.6871737838,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

In 2019, the journey culminated in the release of Avengers: Endgame, which premiered to critical and commercial success. It had gone from a story about a playboy billionaire (Tony Stark\/Iron Man) to a larger story than spanned universes as well as heroes and villains alike. Although, as the universe expanded, it was hard to ignore that Marvel\u2019s roster of superheroes still lacked diversity. This was made even more apparent when other superhero stories started to make their way into the mainstream.\u00a0 In the same year that Endgame came out, a quiet and subversive TV show was making waves. The Boys is adapted from a graphic novel of the same name, one that is notorious amongst fans and haters alike for its crude, graphic and violent nature. The series considers what would happen if superheroes existed in the real world. The short answer is that they would become an untouchable commodity that could wreak havoc, which would be cleaned up by their slick and all-powerful parent company Vought. The series touches on power, social media, politics and causes the line between hero and villain to become truly blurred.\u00a0 It is difficult not to draw comparisons between the storylines in The Boys and the reality of the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe).","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.331620574,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

Swiatek, who looked extremely nervous before the match began, looked anything but once the rackets started swinging. She came out strong, showing off all the skills we know her for: explosive movement, pinpoint precision and a soft touch. By comparison, Jabeur, who looked comfortable and happy before the match started, came out looking flat and tentative. It wasn't until Swiatek was up 3-0 that Jabeur got on the board. Then, in the fifth game of the first set, Jabeur hit four winners, each one perfectly placed along the singles sideline. All Swiatek could do with those is watch them bounce as Jabeur narrowed the gap at 3-2. Unfortunately, that was the last game Jabeur won in the first set. Swiatek was able to reach balls that most people couldn't even try for, while Jabeur couldn't stop hitting the ball into the net at the most vital moments.

As a quick refresher, the iPhone 14 lineup is expected to consist of four different devices across two different screen sizes. The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro will feature a 6.1-inch display, while the iPhone 14 Max and iPhone 14 Pro Max will feature a 6.7-inch display.  This will mark the first time that Apple has offered a non-Pro version of the iPhone with a 6.7-inch display. But with that being said, there will be some key differences between the iPhone 14 models and the iPhone 14 Pro models. This includes the chip inside. Apple has traditionally upgraded the chip inside the iPhone every year. For instance, the iPhone 12 lineup was powered by the A14 chip, while the iPhone 13 lineup is powered by the A15 chip.

The slap was in response to Rock's joke about Smith's wife Jada Pinkett Smith's shaved head, which she had been shaving since 2021 due to alopecia areata. Smith returned to his seat and shouted profanity at Rock, who briefly responded, but completed his presentation without further interruption.  Later that evening, Smith won Best Actor and apologized to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and other nominees, but not to Rock, in his acceptance speech. The next day, he issued an apology to Rock and the Academy through social media. Smith resigned his Academy membership on April 1, facing a potential suspension or expulsion, and was banned from attending Academy events for 10 years, effective April 8.

Bret Taylor, Twitter's Independent Board Chair, said, \"The Twitter Board conducted a thoughtful and comprehensive process to assess Elon's proposal with a deliberate focus on value, certainty, and financing. The proposed transaction will deliver a substantial cash premium, and we believe it is the best path forward for Twitter's stockholders.\" Parag Agrawal, Twitter's CEO, said, \"Twitter has a purpose and relevance that impacts the entire world.","Jaccard Noise_40":1.0,"Cosine Noise_40":1.0,"EM Noise_40":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":1,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"Elon Musk","Noise_60 Document Index":"6","Noise_60 Document":"Markets     Fear & Greed Index                  Latest Market News            Elon Musk has completed his $44 billion acquisition of Twitter, the company confirmed in a securities filing Friday, putting the world\u2019s richest man in charge of one of the world\u2019s most influential social media platforms.

Mr. Musk, who is one of Twitter\u2019s most active users and has more than 109 million followers, began accumulating shares in the company this year. In April, he struck the deal to buy the company for $44 billion and said he would lift Twitter\u2019s content moderation policies, eliminate spam, add new features and provide more transparency about the algorithms used to promote content. \u201cTwitter has tremendous potential \u2014 I look forward to working with the company and the community of users to unlock it,\u201d he said in a statement in April. But, within weeks, he began questioning the deal. Mr. Musk lashed out at the Twitter executives responsible for content decisions and accused the company of failing to accurately count the spam accounts on its platform. When Parag Agrawal, Twitter\u2019s chief executive, tried debunking Mr. Musk\u2019s claims, Mr. Musk responded by tweeting a poop emoji. By July, Mr. Musk had decided that he no longer wanted to own Twitter, arguing that he had been misled about the amount of spam on the platform. He announced his intent to abandon the acquisition. Twitter sued Mr. Musk to force him to carry out the agreement. The company accused Mr. Musk of trying to back out of the deal because the economic downturn had caused a decline in his personal wealth.

A panel of 13 experts were invited to a virtual meeting which took place on 27 March 2021. The proceedings were organised in the sub-sections diagnosis, debridement, infection control, dressings, grafting, pain management, oxygen treatment, outcomes and future needs. Eighty percent or better concurrence among the panellists was considered a consensus. A large number of critical questions were discussed and agreed upon. Important takeaways included that wound care needs to be simplified to a point that it can be delivered by the patient or the patient's family. Another one was that telemonitoring, which has proved very useful during the COVID-19 pandemic, can help reduce the frequency of interventions by a visiting nurse or a wound care center.

The Wall Street consensus for this quarter was $17.659 billion in revenue and earnings of $2.26 per share. The expectations represent a massive year-over-year increase after Tesla achieved a new record for deliveries with over 310,000 deliveries during the quarter. Tesla released the results today and beat Wall Street expectations on both revenue and earnings with $18,756 billion in revenue and $3.22 per share (non-GAAP) during the first quarter of 2022. Tesla\u2019s stock (TSLA) was up by as much as 4% in aftermarket trading after investors learned of the results. Here\u2019s Tesla\u2019s financial summary from the quarterly results (last quarter in red): The automaker managed to increase operating income to $3.6 billion during the quarter. Probably the most impressive metric is Tesla achieving 32.9% GAAP Automotive gross margin in the quarter. That\u2019s despite supply chain issues and increasing costs, but Tesla has been known to quickly pass those customers with price increases and it is being reflected in its margins.","Jaccard Noise_60":0.3333333333,"Cosine Noise_60":0.8611034751,"EM Noise_60":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_60":0,"Noise_80 Predicted Answer":"$18.76 billion","Noise_80 Document Index":"9","Noise_80 Document":"Tesla, the EV manufacturer, generated a revenue of $16.93 billion in Q2 2022, a decrease of nearly 10% as compared to $18.76 billion in revenues in Q1 2022. Tesla generates its revenues from three segments: automotive sales, energy generation & storage, and services. In Q2 2022, the revenue from Automotive sales stood at $14,602 million (a 13% decline quarter-over-quarter), Energy generation and storage generated $866 million (a 32% decline quarter-over-quarter) in revenues, and revenues from the services segment amounted to $1,466 million (a 138% increase quarter-over-quarter). Tesla generates the majority of its revenues from its automotive business. In 2021, Tesla produced a total of 930,422 vehicles and delivered 936,222 vehicles. Automotive sales:  The automotive segment includes manufacturing, sales, and leasing of electric vehicles as well as sales of automotive regulatory credits. Automotive sales include production and deliveries of Model S, Model X, Model 3, and Model Y vehicles, including access to Tesla\u2019s Supercharger network, internet connectivity, Autopilot or FSD features, and over-the-air software updates. These vehicle deliveries are vehicles that are not subject to lease accounting.  Automotive regulatory credits include sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers.

The company\u2019s quarter is hard to fault. Revenues at Tesla rose 81% on a year-over-year basis, a figure bested by 87% growth in automotive revenues across a similar time frame. Even more, the company\u2019s operating expenses only ticked up 15% compared to the year-ago quarter, giving the EV company a huge jump in its operating margin \u2014 that figure rose from 5.7% in the year-ago quarter, to 14.7% in the final quarter of 2021, to 19.2% in its most recent three-month period. While Tesla\u2019s overall figures were strong in the quarter when compared to expectations, it was the company\u2019s automotive business that stood out.  In contrast, Tesla\u2019s \u201cenergy generation and storage\u201d revenues, which combines energy storage and solar, came to $616 million \u2014 slimmer than what it managed in quarters two, three and four in 2021. The company did beat its year-ago energy and storage top line result of $494 million, however. (Notably the company\u2019s solar deployments fell sharply in the quarter, and energy storage deployments, measured in megawatt hours, posted a gain from year-ago results, but a weaker total tally than quarters two, three and four saw last year.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.5992636681,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

It sold quickly, and with 10.67 million copies sold, was approximately the eighteenth-best-selling Nintendo Switch title.[1]  Following the Team Chaos victory in the Chaos vs. Order Splatfest, Splatoon 3's style is very chaotic, bringing post-apocalyptic, patchwork, and other chaotic elements together with the styles of both previous games.  Splatoon 3 expands the Splatoon series on many different fronts, with an extensive story mode, new Salmon Run challenges and rewards, a wider range of customisation with more options (including the additions of Splashtags and the locker room), and the new mode Tableturf Battle. Additionally, Splatoon 3 streamlines many aspects of the previous games. The Battle Lobby has been reworked into a greatly-expanded practice area accessible between matches, Splatfests are overhauled with three teams rather than two and a new Tricolor Turf War mode, and the UI has been made more responsive and informative.

The Forest Road Company originally was part of the Najafi consortium in taking over STX\u2019s debt, but it no longer is part of the revived studio going forward.

R. Martin and Ryan Condal for HBO. A prequel to Game of Thrones (2011\u20132019), it is the second television series in the A Song of Ice and Fire franchise. Condal and Miguel Sapochnik served as the showrunners for the first season. Based on parts of Martin's 2018 book Fire & Blood, the series begins about 100 years after the Seven Kingdoms are united by the Targaryen Conquest, nearly 200 years before the events of Game of Thrones, and 172 years before the birth of Daenerys Targaryen. Featuring an ensemble cast, the show portrays the events leading up to the beginning of the decline of House Targaryen, a devastating war of succession known as the \"Dance of the Dragons\".  House of the Dragon received a straight-to-series order in October 2019, with casting beginning in July 2020 and principal photography starting in April 2021 in the United Kingdom. The series premiered on August 21, 2022, with the first season consisting of ten episodes. Five days after its premiere, the series was renewed for a second season. Sapochnik departed as showrunner after the first season, leaving Condal to serve as the sole showrunner for the second season.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.6666666667,"Cosine Noise_0":0.8159325123,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Aug. 21","Noise_20 Document Index":"0","Noise_20 Document":"House of the Dragon premieres Aug. 21 on HBO.

Spin-off House Of The Dragon therefore debuts to less hype than it might have once had, but really could restore our fascination with Westeros. Immediately, its premiere boasts everything that Thrones did well: an overqualified cast of character actors; backstabbing; sexposition; and lots of dragons. The first proposed spin-off to Game Of Thrones \u2013 a Naomi Watts-led adventure set in Westeros\u2019 distant past \u2013 was ultimately scrapped, reportedly because it was too different from the original show. Perhaps as a result, it sometimes feels like there\u2019s an element of overcorrection here. It\u2019s beautifully rendered - the budget is clearly late-season Game Of Thrones rather than Season 1, and both the Cornish and Spanish locations and the computer-generated dragon flights look magical - but looks and sounds awfully close to its progenitor, down to iconography and locations. That\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing when it comes to the storytelling, since it\u2019s set just far enough in Westeros\u2019 past to keep us guessing, but it speaks of a pervasive timidity in Hollywood to take even the most minor of risks.

The remaining 69.66% will stay with Kadokawa. \u201cWith an eye on further expansion of the Game Business, the Group recognizes the enhancement of capabilities for the creation, development and deployment of game IP as one of the Group\u2019s highest priorities,\u201d the announcement reads. \u201cIn line with this policy, the Company has decided to have FromSoftware implement fund procurement by way of a Third-Party Allotment to Sixjoy and SIE.\u201d The news comes on the heels of FromSoftware\u2019s most successful launch to date; in mid-August, Elden Ringsurpassed 16.6 million units sold since its release in February.\u00a0 \u201cElden Ring is a true outlier success story,\u201d NPD analyst Mat Piscatella told GameDaily in May. \u201cNo reasonable forecast scenario would have planned for the title to be this big. But Elden Ring is a blockbuster in every sense of the word. Hats off to everyone involved. This is one of those very rare market surprises that go along with a shift in the gaming culture and landscape.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.0181844383,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":0,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Tencent and Sony Interactive Entertainment","Noise_20 Document Index":"9","Noise_20 Document":"Sep 1, 2022 ...

A global Interpol warrant had been out for his arrest as US authorities tried to track him down.

In 2015, he had admitted to bribery and corruption charges and had been a co-operative witness for prosecutors. Authorities had allowed him to be detained at home in San Diego because he had suffered bouts of poor health in recent years, including kidney cancer.  However on 4 September, police went to his house after problems with his GPS bracelet were detected. \"Upon arrival they noticed that nobody was home,\" a US Marshal spokesman Omar Castillo told reporters at the time.

Full details of the decision are expected to be published next week, a commission spokesman said Tuesday.\u00a0 Meta confirmed the fine and said it plans to appeal the decision.\u00a0 \"This inquiry focused on old settings that we updated over a year ago, and we've since released many new features to help keep teens safe and their information private,\" a Meta spokesperson told CNET via email on Tuesday. \"Anyone under 18 automatically has their account set to private when they join Instagram, so only people they know can see what they post, and adults can't message teens who don't follow them.\"\u00a0 The spokesperson added that Meta disagrees with how the fine was calculated and is reviewing the rest of the commission's decision. The $400 million fine would be the second-largest issued to a tech company for a violation of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, behind Amazon's record-setting $888 million fine in 2021.","Jaccard Noise_20":0.75,"Cosine Noise_20":0.8801279664,"EM Noise_20":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":1,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"225 million euros","Noise_40 Document Index":"5","Noise_40 Document":"It has opened over a dozen investigations into Meta companies, including Facebook and WhatsApp.           WhatsApp was last year fined a record 225 million euros for failing to conform with EU data rules in 2018.

An investigation conducted by the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO) found the video-sharing app may have breached data protection law between May 2018 and July 2020. The ICO issued TikTok with a \u201cnotice of intent\u201d, a precursor to handing down a potential fine, which could be up to \u00a327m. If TikTok were to be fined this amount it would be the largest in the ICO\u2019s history, exceeding the record \u00a320m handed to British Airways two years ago after an incident in 2018 that saw the personal details of more than 400,000 customers compromised by hackers. The maximum fine the ICO can impose would be based on a calculation of 4% of TikTok\u2019s global annual turnover. The regulator\u2019s \u201cprovisional view\u201d is that TikTok may have processed the data of children under the age of 13 without parental consent, and failed to provide proper information to its users in a \u201cconcise, transparent and easily understood way\u201d.

While investigating the events that led to their mentor's demise, the heroes become embroiled in an ancient conflict between two secret organizations fighting for control of Gotham: the Court of Owls and the League of Shadows.  Gameplay is presented from the third-person perspective with a primary focus on using each playable character's traversal and combat abilities to defeat enemies and explore the environment. Players can freely move around Gotham City, interacting with characters, undertaking missions, and gaining experience points and other resources to level up their characters and equipment. Outside of the story, players are able to complete side missions to unlock additional content and collectible items.

The 19-year-old Spaniard and sentient highlight reel, whose sublime shotmaking and dogged hustle have seen him tabbed as the new face of the sport, came from behind and held on from ahead in a 6-7 (6), 6-3, 6-1, 6-7 (5), 6-3 thriller to book a place in Sunday\u2019s final opposite fifth-seeded Casper Ruud, who battled past Karen Khachanov in the day\u2019s first semi-final. Up against an opponent brimming with confidence and the crackling Arthur Ashe Stadium atmosphere of nearly 24,000 spectators largely in the American\u2019s corner, Alcaraz conjured his best tennis in one pressure moment after another with a poise and nerve beyond his years, ending the deepest run by an American man at the US Open since Andy Roddick reached the 2006 final and further building on his reputation as the best teenager in men\u2019s tennis since Rafael Nadal nearly two decades ago. For more than four hours Alcaraz and Tiafoe traded hellfire in physical baseline rallies and tested their ample movement to the limit in dazzling cat-and-mouse exchanges that covered every inch of the court.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":1.0000001192,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Casper Ruud","Noise_20 Document Index":"0","Noise_20 Document":"Tiafoe\u2019s rollicking U.S. Open run ended at the hands of the 19-year-old Alcaraz, who will play Casper Ruud in the men\u2019s singles final on Sunday. 3\u00a0Carlos Alcaraz 22\u00a0Frances Tiafoe  Matthew Futterman Nearly every year now, it seems, the U.S. Open becomes a life-changing event. Last year a British teenager, a few months removed from her high school graduation, showed up in New York for the qualifying tournament in late August. Three weeks later, Emma Raducanu left the city as a Grand Slam champion and global sensation. This time around, Frances Tiafoe, an electric 24-year-old who has long been filled with unrealized upside, took the journey from virtual unknown to a player who could draw the former first lady Michelle Obama and the actor Jamie Foxx out to watch him. Tiafoe brought his remarkable story: He is the son of immigrants from Sierra Leone, his father a maintenance worker at a local tennis center, where coaches discovered his little boy hitting balls against a wall. Now Tiafoe was bidding to become the first American man since Andy Roddick to make the U.S. Open final.

Easier said than done, of course, and extremely obvious, but also very simple and smart. Beating a great player like Nadal, or his heir apparent, Alcaraz, is hard enough on a flat tennis court. When it\u2019s tilted and you have to run uphill from the start, it becomes even more difficult. Also, Tiafoe serves so hard, and he has given opponents so few opportunities to break him, that when a set is tight late he has a real advantage because he can win so many easy points. That puts tremendous pressure on an opponent to hold his own serve and to play perfectly when returning. To get to that point though, he has to not play from behind.","Jaccard Noise_40":0.0,"Cosine Noise_40":0.2703239322,"EM Noise_40":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":0,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"Frances Tiafoe","Noise_60 Document Index":"4","Noise_60 Document":"Sep 9, 2022 ...

In 2020, Kargman co-wrote (with William Day Frank) and directed a short version of this feature. The primary difference here is Kargman swapping herself out as the lead actress for Kiersey Clemons, whose star-making opportunity has eluded her since her promising breakout in 2015\u2019s Dope. Now, we know why. As you might expect of a film with a character\u2019s name in the title, Susie Searches is all about Susie Wallis, a bright college student whose compulsive meticulousness and true crime obsession have left her friendless.","Jaccard Noise_40":0.0,"Cosine Noise_40":0.5125677586,"EM Noise_40":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":0,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"Sophie Kargman","Noise_60 Document Index":"1","Noise_60 Document":"Susie Searches: Directed by Sophie Kargman.

Along for the ride is another batch of reviews, highlighting the eclectic energy that film festivals provide. This time in my report I\u2019ve got a true-crime podcast satire, a beautiful rumination on love, and a dramatic thriller about doppelg\u00e4ngers. Let\u2019s begin. Despite this being a satire (and a very effective one -for three acts at least) this is also a film steeped in loneliness.\u00a0Susie Searches\u00a0plays on our societal love for true crime, and our unabashed quest for fame. With some bitingly funny moments and clever surprises along the way, its combination of genres and tones makes for a promising and snappy debut feature from Sophie Kargman.College student Susie Wallis (Kiersey Clemons) has her own true crime podcast, but it\u2019s not getting the traction she\u2019s hoping for.

So while not without its flaws, there is still a lot to like about what Kargman puts on-screen. It showcases hubris incarnate as it destroys a \u201cgood\u201d person by pushing her into corners that demand \u201cbad\u201d decisions to be made. Clemons is great in the role too. There\u2019s always a keen sense of artifice that contradicts the way so many others see her smile as a sign of purity rather than a mask hiding the fact that her intelligence has corrupted her moral compass. Wolff excels by being her antithesis\u2014morality refusing to bend to stardom. I like that it all gets darker as it continues and plays with earlier set-ups in perhaps surprising ways, but the pacing does leave a bit to be desired. A solid, imperfect debut.

Image courtesy HBO Max Titans season 4 introduced us to Lex Luthor. Who plays the legendary DC character on the HBO Max series? One of the frontrunners of playing all things nefarious and intimidating when it comes to onscreen portrayals of villains, Titus Welliver is now the next Lex Luthor on the small screen for Titans season 4. You might have just figured this out by watching the season 4 premiere, which is aptly titled \u201cLex Luthor\u201d, but it was actually announced back in September during a preview on EW. As stated by the showrunner, Greg Walker, bringing Welliver on board to portray the Man of Steel\u2019s deadliest foe Lex Luthor was seemingly a less arduous task than you might think as he was already a fan of the source material. He expressed his inner geek as a comic book fan. The\u00a0Titans show boss stated: \u201c[W]hen I called to lure him in, I could barely get a word in. We were talking on the phone and he was just walking through his library, telling me about all his Wolfman\/Perez Titans\u00a0editions.\u201d As revealed in the first teaser that premiered at this year\u2019s New York Comic-Con, which is by far the darkest yet, this version of Lex has seemingly gained supernatural powers.

He'd watched every episode of the show, and could tell me about certain stories, certain shots.

Luthor is one of the most menacing and cunning villains ever, having bested Superman several times using nothing but his wits. Titans will stay true to Luthor\u2019s comic persona. \"He has a very sensitive, thoughtful approach to evil and power. You know what he's done, what he's capable of doing, except like many of those people, he's personable. He doesn't have a cat on his lap. Yeah.

The mega-deal was all about strengthening Google's capabilities in detecting cyber threats \u2013 something Mandiant has become well-known for, said Google Cloud Chief Information Security Officer Phil Venables at a press conference yesterday. \u201cI want to emphasize that this is adding more frontline threat intelligence,\u201d Venables said. \u201cWhen you look at what we\u2019ve got existing at Google, which includes very complementary things from VirusTotal and our other threat intelligence capabilities, bringing that together really gives us this kind of end-to-end security operations stack. Again, Google Cloud is already strong when we think about how we analyze data and put it in context, and that only gets stronger with Mandiant.\u201d Venables was very clear that Google Cloud's ambitions in cybersecurity are massive, but on some level, the size of the deal already said it all. The acquisition is Google's second-largest ever, surpassed only by the company's $12.5 billion buyout of Motorola ten years ago. The more than $5 billion the company spent on Mandiant overshadows even what Google shelled out for Fitbit, which it bought for $2.1 billion. The timing of this deal also wasn't an accident \u2013 it's a response to a changing environment.","Jaccard Noise_80":1.0,"Cosine Noise_80":0.9275108576,"EM Noise_80":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":1,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"$21 billion","Noise_100 Document Index":"4","Noise_100 Document":"Due to the detection, less than 100 customers ended up getting hacked. The company\u2019s specialization in threat detection is what helped them stand out in the market. Google is investing heavily in its cloud cybersecurity business sector. While Google still has a long way to go to catch up with AWS and Azure, the company is willing to invest its financial resources into growth, even to the detriment of short term profit. When Google first announced the deal, they brought up how combining Mandiant with Google Cloud\u2019s security offerings will help Cloud customers with increased protection in five key areas:   The company is also hopeful that the combination of Google Cloud and Mandiant will encourage further collaboration and innovation in the cybersecurity sector while increasing threat research capabilities. As cyber-attacks become more sophisticated, it\u2019s clear that organizations, governments and individuals need further protection. There\u2019s also significant money to be made in storage as more streaming services emerge. We looked at the earnings report for Alphabet, the parent company of Google, to see how much the cloud business brings in. During the Q2 earnings report for 2022, the CEO of Alphabet and Google, Sundar Pichai, declared that performance for the quarter was driven by search and cloud functionality. The company has invested plenty of resources into the AI and computing that\u2019s needed to grow cloud services for businesses of all sizes. Google brought in $21 billion in revenue from cloud services in 2021, which accounted for 7.5% of the company\u2019s total revenue.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.3333333333,"Cosine Noise_100":0.4419164658,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

In the present, after ridding the Great Deku Tree from gloom in Korok Forest, Link retrieves the Master Sword from the Light Dragon and goes to confront Ganondorf below Hyrule Castle. With the aid of Sidon, Tulin, Yunobo, Riju, and Mineru, Link battles an army of monsters before engaging in combat with Ganondorf himself. Nearing defeat, Ganondorf swallows his secret stone and becomes the Demon Dragon, taking Link into the skies above Hyrule. With the assistance of the Light Dragon, Link uses the Master Sword to shatter the Demon Dragon's secret stone, killing it. Aided by the spirits of Rauru and Sonia, Link turns the Light Dragon back into Zelda and regains his original right arm. Rauru and Sonia fade away, and Link and Zelda fall to the surface below, where they reunite.  Some time later, on the Great Sky Island, Mineru bids goodbye to Zelda and Link before fading away, while the sages vow to protect Hyrule.  Development of Tears of the Kingdom started in 2017 after Breath of the Wild was completed.

It's nearly here! Hocus Pocus 2 is only weeks away and we've been given a spooky treat of a new trailer for the eagerly-awaited sequel. The second trailer was debuted at the D23 Expo and it gave us our first look at Hannah Waddingham's role as The Witch, as well as the return of Doug Jones as \"good zombie\" Billy Butcherson. Disney released the first trailer for the highly-anticipated sequel in late June and if you weren't aware of the demand for the movie, the trailer notched up more than 40 million views in its first 24 hours. The sequel sees the Sanderson Sisters return to wreak havoc in Salem once again, but what else can we expect? Here's everything you need to know about Hocus Pocus 2. As mentioned above, the first trailer for Hocus Pocus 2 arrived on June 28, 2022 and while it was low on plot, it was high on spookiness. The trailer teased the return of the Sanderson Sisters and featured other classic Hocus Pocus items such as the Black Flame Candle.

Behind the scenes, the sequel was written by Jen D'Angelo and was originally set to be directed by Adam Shankman. Following a scheduling conflict (thanks to Shankman's work on Disenchanted), Anne Fletcher took over but Shankman stayed on as executive producer. Along with the official announcement in May 2021, we got our first plot details about what we can expect from the sequel. \"Three young women accidentally bring the Sanderson Sisters back to modern-day Salem and must figure out how to stop the child-hungry witches from wreaking a new kind of havoc on the world,\" it reads. This does sound a little bit like the book sequel that was released in July 2018 which centred on Max and Allison's daughter Poppy, her friend Travis and a girl called Isabella who Poppy has a crush on. In order to impress Isabella, Poppy sneaks into the Sanderson house during a blood moon and accidentally brings the sisters back to life. It's unclear if this is exactly what will happen in the movie sequel, so might end up being non-canon. The first movie ended (spoiler alert) with the magic book winking its eye, proving it's still alive and the witches could return...

By including this line in the episode, the \"House of the Dragon\" writers are emphasizing how Alicent's direct barbs helped lead to Ser Harwin and Lyonel Strong's deaths in the final minutes of the episode. Back in episode five, little Prince Aegon Targaryen II was a toddler.

She placed two rainbow pin badges next to the sweet pic, in what appears to be a heartfelt reference to lesbian character Claire.  The actress went on to add the caption, \"Goodbye Derry Girls, it\u2019s been quite a ride \ud83c\udf08,\" seeming to confirm that filming has indeed finished. We're not crying, you're crying.  Filming for Derry Girls season 3 was originally supposed to start in June 2020, but was delayed due to the pandemic. However, on 1 November 2021, Nicola shared another Instagram post featuring a behind-the-scenes snap from set, appearing to make the start of production. Posting a very close-up selfie complete with her character Claire's signature fringe and scrunchie pigtails, Nicola wrote, \"Guess who\u2019s back in the house #ReturnOfTheWeeLesbian\" - in reference to the season 1 episode which saw Claire come out as a lesbian.  While it wasn't 100% clear whether filming had properly started, Nicola certainly seemed to be in costume (hey, maybe she just likes to dress up at home to get into character).   While Nicola Coughlan has confirmed that she's returning as Claire, the rest of the main cast will remain the same too.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.4098544121,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

It makes him a double world champion at 25 and now he's close to breaking Formula 1's record for most wins in a single season, with four events still left to run. But Verstappen's title celebrations were overshadowed by the chaos and confusion during and after the wet race last Sunday, which has led to even more questions being raised about the procedures and attitudes of motorsport's governing body. There was also plenty of intrigue further down the field and off the track too. Here are the headline takeaways from F1's first visit back to Suzuka in three years. Verstappen hugs Adrian Newey after claiming a second F1 world title Photo by: Sam Bloxham \/ Motorsport Images It had been coming ever since Charles Leclerc crashed out of the lead of the French GP: Verstappen was going to be the 2022 world champion.

When you do that, you\u2019re making sure your computer environment stays working and intact, rather than running the risk of one software app not launching or a hardware device losing connectivity. While updates are pushed to our mobile devices and computers all the time, upgrading macOS on a music or multimedia production computer is a big deal, and it should be done with caution. On one hand, the latest, greatest features are oh so appealing but, on the other hand, are potentially unverified and unsupported hardware\/software configurations that compromise your workflow and ability to work. Before macOS 11 Big Sur\u2019s release in fall 2020, Apple released updates to \u201cOS X\u201d in chapters (10.8, 10.9, 10.10, 10.11, etc.).

(See the rest of the differences between the Google Pixel Watch vs. Fitbit Sense 2.) The Pixel Watch release date was October 13, 2022, and since then we're continuing to track the best Pixel Watch deals.\u00a0Note that the Pixel Watch launched alongside the Google Pixel 7 and Google Pixel 7 Pro, which would both make ideal companion devices for the company's smartwatch.\u00a0 The Google Pixel Watch is a simple-looking smartwatch, I might even call it minimalistic. It comes in just one size: 41mm. Those with larger wrists might complain about the lack of a larger option; that said, it fit me perfectly.\u00a0 The face features a rounded design with a 3D glass dome. This raised effect distracts from the display's thick bezel, but doesn't change the fact that a good chunk of the display is unusable. Perhaps my prior experience with Samsung watches is to blame? I can't help but think it's a missed opportunity to incorporate in digital rotating bezel in that space.\u00a0  It seems like no mistake that the Pixel Watch is a \"dark mode\" device. The interface and all of Google's watch faces have black backgrounds to further conceal the bezel.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.6666666667,"Cosine Noise_0":0.8029304147,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"May 2023","Noise_20 Document Index":"1","Noise_20 Document":"65] Nicole Nguyen of The Wall Street Journal did not find the smartwatch particularly astounding and noted several software bugs, but ultimately deemed it a worthy companion to the Pixel phone.[66]  Analyst firm Canalys calculated that Google shipped an estimated 880,000 Pixel Watches during the fourth quarter of 2022, constituting 22\u00a0percent of Google's total wearable sales, which include Fitbit products. The Pixel Watch's launch allowed Google to obtain 8\u00a0percent of the wearable market share, jumping 16\u00a0percent from fourth place to second place, behind Apple.[67] The Pixel Watch Android app had amassed more than 500,000 downloads by February 2023.[68]  In May 2023, it was reported that Google was aiming to launch a second-generation Pixel Watch later that year, alongside the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro.[69]","Jaccard Noise_20":0.0,"Cosine Noise_20":0.6457664967,"EM Noise_20":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":0,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"2021","Noise_40 Document Index":"3","Noise_40 Document":"The Pixel Watch is a Wear OS smartwatch designed, developed, and marketed by Google as part of the Google Pixel product line.

The Pixel Watch starts at $350 for Bluetooth and Wi-Fi and $400 for 4G LTE. For smartwatch users, there's not much new here. Heartrate tracking, fitness tracking and sleep tracking have been available for years in products from Fitbit and other companies, notably Apple. I was hoping Google's first Fitbit tie-in would bring some more groundbreaking innovations to the wearable game, especially for the price. The new Apple Watch SE is just $250 and has the same main features as the Pixel Watch. The same is true for Samsung's Galaxy Watch5, which costs $280. Google's Pixel Watch is the company's premium watch, whereas the Apple Watch SE and Galaxy Watch 5 are base models. But the features each offer are pretty similar. The main benefit I can see to the Pixel Watch is the beautiful, inconspicuous design. The round face and domed glass design make the Pixel Watch feel more luxurious. It's also made out of stainless steel, which is more expensive than cheaper aluminum smartwatch base models.","Jaccard Noise_80":0.0,"Cosine Noise_80":0.4798984528,"EM Noise_80":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":0,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"Swappa","Noise_100 Document Index":"3","Noise_100 Document":"Start by listing your Google Pixel Watch for sale on Swappa.

Sunak, who is the U.K.\u2019s first leader of color, met King Charles III at Buckingham Palace, where the monarch officially asked the new leader of the governing Conservative Party to form a government, as is tradition.

In short, Netflix isn\u2019t something I want to spend $240 on each year anymore \u2014 its salad days are a distant memory \u2014 and the company is finally starting to empathize with my reasoning.

Ironically, Season 1 was filmed amidst the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic when the tourism industry had been facing many setbacks. This gave production designer Laura Fox the opportunity to spend time redesigning the artwork, sets, and scenery in each room featured in the series; The White Lotus fans have enjoyed analyzing the background details for hidden Easter eggs, and Fox herself compared the subtle menace of the hotel to The Shining. Between assassination attempts, mafia, familial conflict, and beautiful Italian scenery, The White Lotus: Sicily had a lot in common with The Godfather. Similar to Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s 1972 crime classic, season 2 was filmed on location in Italy. The San Domenico Palace, Taormina stands in for the clifftop resort in the series. Additionally, White makes use of several local wonders, including the Ionian Sea, the Greek Theater of Teatro Antico di Taormina, and the active Mount Etna volcano, which erupts in the final episode, \u201cArrivederci.\u201d Considering that The White Lotus: Sicily focuses on the issues of colonialism, it makes sense that the series was filmed in a location with a complex history.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.7206804752,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":0,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Asia","Noise_20 Document Index":"2","Noise_20 Document":"Excitingly, however, there\u2019s currently a sale on at the San Domenico Palace.

United States Republicans have regained control of the House of Representatives, securing a narrow majority in a midterm election that saw the party fail to meet expectations. The Associated Press declared Republican Mike Garcia the winner in California\u2019s 27th congressional district Wednesday, giving the GOP 218 seats, the threshold for the majority needed to take over the lower chamber of Congress. Republican Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy will likely become House speaker when the new Congress convenes early next year after his party nominated him to the position on Tuesday. He will replace Democrat Nancy Pelosi who has held the gavel since 2019. Although the much-anticipated \u201cred wave\u201d of Republican victories did not materialise, Republican candidates were able to gain at least five House seats in the November 8 midterms, wiping out the Democrats\u2019 thin majority.  Democrats were able to flip a few districts, but they suffered overall net losses, narrowly losing key races in New York, Florida and other states. Redistricting after the 2020 Census had given conservatives an edge in several parts of the country.

Super PACS and political party groups were spending money almost exclusively in districts that President Biden won in 2020, indicating that Democrats were in a defensive crouch. Midterm elections often benefit the opposition political party at the expense of the White House\u2019s party. 1994 and 2010 were typical midterm elections, where Republicans made gains in the House at the midpoint of Bill Clinton and Barack Obama\u2019s first terms. Similarly, in 2018, Republican\u2019s got crushed in House elections but picked up two seats in the Senate. If a president\u2019s approval ratings are high, then the presiding party typically fares better in midterm House elections. For example, in 1998, Bill Clinton\u2019s approval rating was 66%, and Democrats retained control of the House. In 2002, George W. Bush polled at a 63%, and Republicans made gains. Currently, Biden\u2019s approval rating is 42%, which is similar to former president Barack Obama\u2019s rating in 2010.

If the Democrats lose control of either House, the Administration can expect to be the target of numerous disruptive congressional inquiries. Using the data we discuss below (and provide here) we would expect Democratic seat losses of around 30 in the House and 3 in the Senate. There are large error bounds around these estimates.

It wanted a former college athlete, an exec passionate about higher education, an established corporate leader and a savvy politician who knows how to get things done in government. The governing body found all of those traits and more in Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker, a former Harvard basketball athlete and avid sports fan. The NCAA announced today that it has selected the two-term governor to be its next president. Baker will replace outgoing NCAA President Mark Emmert starting March 1. His second term as governor is slated to conclude Jan. 5; he announced about a year ago that he wouldn\u2019t seek a third term. Emmert will stay on as an adviser through June. The NCAA\u2019s choice of Baker, 66, signifies the association\u2019s desire to have a leader who is well-versed in the ways that Washington, D.C., works. With the NCAA facing so many legal and legislative challenges, the board of governors, who made the hire, focused on someone from the political arena early in the process and Baker emerged as the candidate with the experience and expertise to navigate the governmental and athletic worlds that often collide in college sports. When asked why he wanted the job, Baker replied, \u201cBecause it\u2019s worth doing.

The inequities between the men and women were obvious and stark, which put the NCAA into damage-control mode. At that point, those in the women's basketball world had to question if Emmert was very sincere in his concern, but there was a \"better-late-than-never\" sentiment. And the NCAA's decision to commission the so-called Kaplan report, which did a deep dive into inequities in all men's and women's NCAA championships, was an important step because it didn't pull any punches about how significant those issues have been. The report also said the NCAA has been selling women's sports short regarding potential television revenue. When it's time to negotiate TV rights again, rather than selling multiple championships in a bargain bundle, the NCAA needs to think bigger about the worth of each championship and how best to maximize revenue from it. Also, the NCAA has to show more leadership regarding the inclusion of transgender athletes in competition. As with so many things, the NCAA has been behind on this. Dave Wilson: The next leader is going to have to get creative to figure out the mess of issues currently embroiling college sports, or finally just step out of the way and put on tournaments.

On May 10, 2023, he purchased a Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT for 50 ETH on Blur. At the time, the purchase was equal to about $90,000. Why is this so notable? When Alegre made his purchase, the floor price for Bored Ape NFTs was about 44 ETH (around $78,000), according to CoinGecko.  In short, Alegre used his own money to buy an NFT from his own company \u2014 and he bought it for quite a bit more than he needed to. Through his purchase, Alegre likely hoped to demonstrate his belief in the BAYC NFT project and, more broadly, Yuga Labs\u2019 portfolio of intellectual properties. Currently, this portfolio includes nearly all of the most widely known and valuable projects in the NFT space \u2014 Bored Ape Yacht Club, Otherside, Mutant Ape Yacht Club, Bored Ape Kennel Club, CryptoPunks, and Meebits.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":1.0,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Daniel Alegre","Noise_20 Document Index":"1","Noise_20 Document":"Jul 13, 2023 ...

Big Screen History, Explained Billy Batson is played by Asher Angel while the superhero adult form of Shazam is played by Zachary Levi. The character wears his comic book character's signature red outfit with a white cape and lightning bolt on his chest. Shazam, originally named Captain Marvel, was at one point the most popular superhero in the world and even outsold Superman comics. The character has the potential to be a major part of the DCU; if the sequel does well, there's little doubt he can fit him into James Gunn and Peter Safran's new plans for the franchise. Freddy Freeman is Billy's physically disabled foster brother and also the first person to learn that Billy has superpowers. Freddy is an expert on all things superheroes and helps Billy learn more about his powers. Freddy Freeman's adult form, formerly known as Captain Marvel Jr. in the comics, wears a blue super suit and has a great deal of flight power, which is fitting because that was the superpower he told Billy he wished he could have. One of the most courageous members of the group (representing Achilles), his kid form is played by Jack Dylan Grazer, while his adult form is played by Adam Brody. A notable thing about Freddy Freeman is, while originally under the name Captain Marvel Jr., was the favorite superhero of rock icon Elvis Presley.","Jaccard Noise_20":0.0,"Cosine Noise_20":0.2978718877,"EM Noise_20":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":0,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"Asher Angel","Noise_40 Document Index":"9","Noise_40 Document":"Mar 18, 2023 ...

TikTok Chief Executive Shou Zi Chew faced roughly five hours of questioning by dozens of lawmakers in a high-stakes hearing with the House Energy and Commerce Committee on Thursday about the safety and security of the immensely popular app. Republicans and Democrats alike grilled the 40-year-old Chew about China's relationship with his company, data privacy, possible teen addiction to the app, misinformation and fentanyl.

When asked if TikTok employees can spy on or target people in the U.S., Chew didn't answer directly with a \"yes\" or \"no.\"  He said he has \"seen no evidence that the Chinese government has access to that data. They have never asked us, we have not provided it.\"  The Biden administration told TikTok earlier this month that if its Chinese owners didn't sell their stakes in the app to a U.S. company, it would face being banned. TikTok offered an alternative it's currently working on, called \"Project Texas.\" The project involves restructuring TikTok so that its U.S. user data is stored with software company Oracle in Austin, Texas. In this scenario, the Chinese government couldn't access the data and it would be overseen by Oracle. Essentially it would act as a firewall.  \"Project Texas\" would cost TikTok $1.5 billion and would involve hiring thousands of employees focused on data security.  Chew admitted on Thursday that until Project Texas is complete, Beijing-based employees of TikTok would still be able to access U.S. user data.

But what was exceptional about this hearing was the stubborn, never-ending line of vicious questioning.  From both Democrats and Republicans, there was no let-up.

But between the sometimes frustratingly verbose questioning, we did learn a thing or two.

Jerry Seinfeld, Jason Alexander, and Wayne Knight, playing their respective Seinfeld characters, appeared in a spot presented during halftime of Super Bowl XLVIII on February 2, 2014.[200] FOX came up with the idea of doing such a spot, due in part to the Super Bowl's location being New York City adjacent that year.[200] An uncut version appeared on Crackle.com immediately afterward, as an episode of Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee titled \"The Over-Cheer\", establishing Seinfeld's character on the series as an older version of his Seinfeld character.[200] Although the spot was used to advertise Seinfeld's web series, it was not considered a commercial, as Sony, which produces the series, did not pay for it.","Jaccard Noise_60":0.0,"Cosine Noise_60":0.2848307788,"EM Noise_60":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_60":0,"Noise_80 Predicted Answer":"The Highlights of 100","Noise_80 Document Index":"0","Noise_80 Document":"In this, Alexander acts much like his character George, and his relationship with Lee Iacocca plays on George's relationship with Steinbrenner.

As of Friday, the Iowa Department of Education says it has received 15,538 applications for an Educational Savings Account, or ESA, to provide state funding for a student to attend a private K-12 school. A Legislative Services Agency analysis projected 14,068 would enroll in the first year of the program. The application period runs through June 30th, meaning the number of applications will likely continue to grow. If all of those applications are approved, the taxpayer cost for the program would likely exceed the $107 million dollars estimate for this coming school year. It would also likely mean a larger-than-expected loss in funding to public schools due to students enrolling instead in a private institution. State funding to public schools is based on enrollment, so fewer enrolled students would mean less funding from the state. Governor Reynolds\u2019 voucher program aimed to offset at least some of that by giving districts $1,176 per student who lives in a district and enrolls in a private school. The state declined to provide demographic data on the applications so far, citing the ongoing application period. That means it\u2019s unclear yet how many of the applications are from public school students.","Jaccard Noise_80":0.0,"Cosine Noise_80":0.5026684999,"EM Noise_80":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":0,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"$7,635","Noise_100 Document Index":"3","Noise_100 Document":"Details of approved documents to submit for income requirement verification are listed below: Approved Income Restriction Verification Documents For Iowa tax purposes, ESA funds are not taxable income if the funds are used for eligible educational expenses (e.g., tuition and fees, tutoring).

In midday trading, iRobot shares rose 19%. Amazon's were down 1.4%. The deal comes as anti-monopoly advocates continue to raise concerns about Amazon's increasing dominance. The purchase of iRobot is Amazon's fourth-largest acquisition, led by its $13.7 billion deal to buy Whole Foods in 2017. Last month, the company said it would buy the primary care provider One Medical in a deal valued roughly at $3.9 billion, a move that expanded its reach further into health care. On Friday, groups advocating for stricter antitrust regulations called on regulators to block the iRobot merger, arguing it gives Amazon more access into consumers' lives and furthers its dominance in the smart home market. \"The last thing American and the world needs is Amazon vacuuming up even more of our personal information,\" said Robert Weissman, president of the progressive consumer rights advocacy group Public Citizen. \"This is not just about Amazon selling another device in its marketplace,\" Weissman said. \"It's about the company gaining still more intimate details of our lives to gain unfair market advantage and sell us more stuff.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":1.0,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Amazon","Noise_20 Document Index":"2","Noise_20 Document":"Sep 9, 2022 ...

LLaMA comes in four size variants: 7B, 13B, 33B, and 65B parameters. The paper shows that training smaller foundation models on large enough tokens is desirable, as it requires less computing power and resources. The 65B parameter models have been trained on 1.4 trillion tokens, while the LLaMA 7B model has been trained on 1 trillion tokens. Just a few weeks after the release of LLaMA, the open-source community embraced it by creating an optimized version and expanding its use cases. Now, you can fine-tune LLaMA using LoRA (reduces the number of trainable parameters for fine-tuning) and train a chatbot with Stanford Alpaca. Lightning AI has also joined the trend by providing an open-source, from-scratch rewrite of LLaMA called Lit-LLaMA. The main highlight of Lit-LLaMA is that it is released under the Apache 2.0 license, which makes it easier to adopt for other deep learning projects that use similar permissive licenses and also enables commercial use.","Jaccard Noise_20":0.0,"Cosine Noise_20":0.3075511456,"EM Noise_20":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":0,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"LeConte Lodge","Noise_40 Document Index":"7","Noise_40 Document":"They walk under Grotto Falls and at Trillium Gap, the halfway point, the trails narrows and gets rockier, although the llamas have great gripping abilities, thanks to their foot pads.

Quarterback Competition is far from over as Wells and Drones continue\u00a0to battle it out There was never going to be a definitive answer exiting the Spring Game, but we all got the chance to see the development of Grant Wells and the capabilities of Kyron Drones at the quarterback position. Wells finished 12-of-18 for 148 passing yards (66.7%) and a TD. He had 3 rushes for 10 yards and a rushing touchdown. Notably, Wells threw 6 passes that were gains of 16-or-more yards. The incumbent starter mostly linked up with the Gosnell brothers (Stephen and Benji) and Tucker Holloway. Wells\u00a0executed his plays and limited the risky elements of his playstyle. It also helps that he inherited the more stable offensive line, which once again benefited his performance.","Jaccard Noise_40":0.3333333333,"Cosine Noise_40":0.9205367565,"EM Noise_40":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":0,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"Drones","Noise_60 Document Index":"0","Noise_60 Document":"Both of his interceptions were tipped, one a throw that Jennings had his hands on twice, the second time knocking it high into the air for safety Mose Phillips to pick off, and the second a tipped ball on a rollout to Jennings that Jalen Stroman deflected in the red zone, right to Derrick Canteen. \u201cI thought the decisions were crisp,\u201d Bowen said. \u201cFor both sides, we\u2019ve got to have better ball location all the time.

Since early 2021, the labor market has been uncommonly tight as employers struggled to reverse a sudden mass layoff and navigate huge shifts in the demand for goods and services. The unemployment rate reached its lowest point since the 1960s. Wages at the low end of the pay scale rose faster than they had in decades. All of that has benefited groups that have historically been at a disadvantage in the labor market. The unemployment rate for Black Americans reached its lowest point on record in April, at 4.7 percent, and the gap between the unemployment rates of white and Black people was also the smallest ever measured. The share of working-age people participating in the labor market reached 83.3 percent, matching a level not seen since 2008.

Certain Medicare and Medicaid waivers and broad flexibilities for health care providers are no longer necessary and will end. During the COVID-19 PHE, CMS has used a combination of emergency authority waivers, regulations, and sub-regulatory guidance to ensure and expand access to care and to give health care providers the flexibilities needed to help keep people safe. States, hospitals, nursing homes, and others are currently operating under hundreds of these waivers that affect care delivery and payment and that are integrated into patient care and provider systems. Many of these waivers and flexibilities were necessary to expand facility capacity for the health care system and to allow the health care system to weather the heightened strain created by COVID-19; given the current state of COVID-19, this excess capacity is no longer necessary. CMS developed a roadmap for the eventual end of the COVID-19 PHE, which was published in August 2022, and has been sharing information on what health care facilities and providers can do to prepare for future emergencies.

OpenAI says it\u2019s rolling out the app in the US first and will expand to other countries \u201cin the coming weeks.\u201d OpenAI didn\u2019t previously hint that a mobile app was coming, but it makes sense given the incredible popularity of ChatGPT.

The app\u2019s launch is interesting, considering OpenAI\u2019s somewhat ambivalent approach to positioning ChatGPT in the market.

While headsets like the Meta Quest 3 are true standalone headsets that can also tether to a PC, the Vision Pro needs to be attached to something to work. Now thankfully, you do have options. Option one, you can plug in the headset and use the Vision Pro all day long. Unfortunately, Apple didn't say if that works if the headset is plugged into a Mac or MacBook, so the assumption is you'll need to plug straight into the nearest wall.\u00a0 If that doesn't appeal to you though, there is an alternative. Apple has designed an external battery pack that connects around the temple of the headset via a woven cable. The good news? The battery is slim enough to fit in your pocket, at least according to Apple. And it may even come in multiple sizes, as one rumor tips the Vision Pro to get three different battery pack sizes. The bad news? The only confirmed battery pack lasts just two hours and does seem to be a proprietary charger. Oh, and you may need to buy it separately, which would add to the Apple Vision Pro's $3,499 price tag.
