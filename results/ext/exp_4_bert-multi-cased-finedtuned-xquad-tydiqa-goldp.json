However, hundreds of thousands of people appear to have been added to a waiting list, which suggests a high level of demand that the company isn't capable of handling. At the time of writing, Truth Social is only available on the Apple App Store, with plans to launch an Android version \"soon,\", according to the Truth Social website.  Many people who have downloaded Truth Social so far have said that it looks almost identical to Twitter. While the company has not admitted to copying Twitter, Truth Social was created using an open-source license from a company called Mastodon. Why is this significant? Mastodon is an open-source, decentralized social media platform that was also initially created as an alternative to Twitter. Although Truth Social reached the number one spot on the App Store on day one, there's no guarantee that this success will continue in the long term. Trump is known for posting controversial views on social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook, so people could be downloading the app purely to see what he has to say. Especially as he's been off the grid for a while since most mainstream social media apps banned him.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.5932533741,"EM Noise_100":0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

The news took the world by storm, and was quickly labelled one of the most influential deals in the history of gaming. Yet it\u2019s July 2023, and the two companies are still separate due to a number of legal hurdles, lawsuits and inquiries from governments all around the world.\u00a0 The merger may still go ahead, but no one truly knows if or when. The original deadline for the merger to complete was July 18th, however this has now been extended. We\u2019ve compiled a recap to keep you abreast of the Activision Blizzard deal\u2019s trials and tribulations. Due to the scale of the deal, regulators around the world fear that this acquisition may hurt competition and give Microsoft \u2014 which already owns Xbox \u2014 too much power in the gaming market. Fears have centred around the potential effect on market share in the console gaming market. Microsoft could, regulators argue, make Activision Blizzard\u2019s games (including the ultra-successful Call of Duty franchise) exclusive to its consoles, thereby hurting competition with rivals Sony and Nintendo. Other concerns have been around the potential impact on market share in the growing cloud gaming market.","Jaccard Noise_80":1.0,"Cosine Noise_80":0.9748029709,"EM Noise_80":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":1,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"$68.7\u00a0billion in cash","Noise_100 Document Index":"1","Noise_100 Document":"On January 18, 2022, Microsoft announced its intent to acquire Activision Blizzard for $68.7\u00a0billion in cash.

The acquisition would give Microsoft ownership of franchises including Call of Duty, Crash Bandicoot, Spyro, Warcraft, StarCraft, Diablo, Overwatch, and Candy Crush. If approved by international regulators, it would be the largest video game acquisition in history. Sony has publicly argued against the merger, claiming that the combined company would deny the PlayStation platform of games like Call of Duty by making them console exclusive to the Xbox family, but has made a binding agreement with Microsoft to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation for 10 more years until 2033 after the merge.  Several countries have approved the merger, including the European Commission and China. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) formally filed complaints to block the acquisition on the basis that the merger would hinder competition, particularly in the cloud gaming sector. As part of its attempts to appease these concerns, Microsoft committed to offering Call of Duty and other games to Sony and a host of new console and cloud gaming platforms for a decade.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.6666666667,"Cosine Noise_100":0.8799000382,"EM Noise_100":0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":1}

During the panel session, the three former students recounted the racism they encountered \u2014 despite a facade of peaceful integration. Although their experiences left them feeling socially and intellectually isolated from most of the student body at the time, the pioneers expressed their hope that future generations of Black students at Tech feel at home on campus. \u201cI\u2019m so thankful for those who continue to matriculate here and carry on the tradition,\u201d said Williams.\u00a0 A video greeting from Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens, a Georgia Tech chemical engineering graduate himself, was presented at the celebration.","Jaccard Noise_80":0.0,"Cosine Noise_80":0.3953753114,"EM Noise_80":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":0,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"Christiane Amanpour","Noise_100 Document Index":"1","Noise_100 Document":"The 2023 recipient is Christiane Amanpour. ...

Common configurations include both central processing units (CPUs) and GPUs, but the makers of the chips differ, as does the infrastructure wiring them all together. To compare supercomputers, the industry uses a benchmark called floating-point operations per second\u2014or more colloquially, flops\u2014which measures the number of simple equations a supercomputer solves each second. According to the most recent Top500 list, the world\u2019s fastest all-around supercomputer, Fugaku, hails from Japan. Fugaku, which doesn\u2019t actually use any GPUs, recorded a blistering top speed of 442 petaflops (or 442 thousand trillion operations per second). That\u2019s fast. But systems like Fugaku are increasingly built to train AI too. So, Top500 began reporting a new benchmark for AI applications specifically. Since machine learning algorithms don\u2019t require the same precision as scientific applications, the new AI benchmark uses a less precise measure. By that measure, Fugaku hits peak speeds above an exaflop\u2014or a million trillion operations per second. This is what\u2019s meant by an AI supercomputer. Now, back to Meta.

To fully realize the benefits of self-supervised learning and transformer-based models, various domains, whether vision, speech, language, or for critical use cases like identifying harmful content, will require training increasingly large, complex, and adaptable models. Computer vision, for example, needs to process larger, longer videos with higher data sampling rates. Speech recognition needs to work well even in challenging scenarios with lots of background noise, such as parties or concerts. NLP needs to understand more languages, dialects, and accents. And advances in other areas, including robotics, embodied AI, and multimodal AI will help people accomplish useful tasks in the real world.

{"Query":"What chip does the iPhone 14 have?","Correct Answer":["A15"],"Noise_0 Predicted Answer":"A15 Bionic","Noise_0 Document Index":"0","Noise_0 Document":"By  Mitchell Clark Apple has announced that the regular iPhone won\u2019t be getting a new processor this year \u2014 instead, the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus will be powered by Apple\u2019s A15 Bionic chip, the same chip that\u2019s in the iPhone 13 Pro \u2014 though it does have a bit more grunt than the A15 that was in the regular iPhone 13 and the $429 iPhone SE from earlier this year, thanks to an extra GPU core. This is the first time that Apple\u2019s not updating to a new processor for one of its flagship iPhones since the 2008 iPhone 3G, which featured virtually the same internals as the original iPhone. The iPhone 14 Pro, meanwhile, has an A16 processor, which the company says is more power efficient, even when doing intensive tasks. The raw specs of the new chip are similar, though \u2014 like the A15 in the regular 14, it has a six-core CPU, a five-core GPU, and a 16-core Neural Engine. The new version just has better cores, according to Apple.  The decision not to update the chipset for the standard iPhone 14 isn\u2019t exactly a surprising one. Analysts like Ming-Chi Kuo and reporters like Mark Gurman have been predicting the move for months, and the chip shortage isn\u2019t quite over yet. Using tried and true chips that Apple\u2019s manufacturer already has experience making could help ensure that there are enough processors to meet demand.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.5,"Cosine Noise_0":0.7268928289,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"A15","Noise_20 Document Index":"4","Noise_20 Document":"Apple is set to unveil the all-new iPhone 14 lineup this fall, bringing new features such as an always-on display and upgraded camera hardware. What about the iPhone 14 chip? As it turns out, things are going to be interesting this year. The iPhone 14 chip will be different than the iPhone 14 Pro chip for the first time. As a quick refresher, the iPhone 14 lineup is expected to consist of four different devices across two different screen sizes. The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro will feature a 6.1-inch display, while the iPhone 14 Max and iPhone 14 Pro Max will feature a 6.7-inch display.  This will mark the first time that Apple has offered a non-Pro version of the iPhone with a 6.7-inch display. But with that being said, there will be some key differences between the iPhone 14 models and the iPhone 14 Pro models. This includes the chip inside. Apple has traditionally upgraded the chip inside the iPhone every year. For instance, the iPhone 12 lineup was powered by the A14 chip, while the iPhone 13 lineup is powered by the A15 chip. That won\u2019t be the case this year with the iPhone 14 chip.

The 529-pound rover survived a perilous descent to the surface, including atmospheric entry, slowing from supersonic speeds with a parachute, and finally using retrorockets to safely alight on the ground. Named for an ancient Chinese fire god, the 529-pound Zhurong rover is similar in size to NASA\u2019s Spirit and Opportunity rovers, which landed on the red planet in 2004 and sent back exciting images and data about the planet\u2019s surface conditions.

Over the years, she has wowed audiences with her versatile performances in all kinds of genres that have earned her several awards, and she rose to fame for starring in films such as Speed, Miss Congeniality and While You Were Sleeping, among many others. However, acting is not the only discipline in which Bullock has excelled over the years, as she is a never-ending source of talent. A little known fact about her is that she plays the piano very well, as she took lessons for 12 years. However, regardless of how good she was at it, she did not enjoy it at all. Besides her talent in acting and playing the piano, Bullock can also speak German and took ballet and vocal arts classes.

By Julia Jacobs Nearly a year after Will Smith slapped him onstage at the Oscars, Chris Rock joked about the explosive moment on a live Netflix show Saturday night, using the last few minutes to mock Smith and his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith. \u201cNow I watch \u2018Emancipation,\u2019 just to see him get whooped,\u201d Rock said, referencing last year\u2019s Civil\u00a0War-era drama in which Smith plays an enslaved man who is forced to labor for the Confederacy. In the days after Smith stunned the world with the slap, Rock, a comedian not known to shy away from controversy, was expected to quickly make his feelings about the episode known. Instead, he said at his first show after the Oscars that he was still processing what had happened, and he assured fans that there would be a time and place for him to discuss it in depth. That time and place turned out to be Saturday, at the Hippodrome Theater in Baltimore, in a stand-up show that was live-streamed for the rest of the world. At times, Rock made himself the target of his own jokes, noting Smith\u2019s larger build. \u201cWill Smith does movies with his shirt off,\u201d said Rock, pacing the stage in his white outfit. \u201cYou never seen me do a movie with my shirt off.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.128520757,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":0,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"slap","Noise_20 Document Index":"0","Noise_20 Document":"Rock has not publicly discussed the incident at length, and\u00a0he did not file a formal police report against Smith.

Wow! Will Smith just smacked the shit out of me,\" Rock said as the audience laughed, thinking it was a skit. Smith then made what may become one of the most repeated phrases of Oscar history when he shouted, \"Keep my wife's name out of your fucking mouth.\" Stunned by what had just happened, Rock told Smith it was only a joke, but Smith shouted his phrase a second time, louder and more deliberately. At that point, many stars in the audience audibly gasped or fell silent. Spectators in the mezzanine stood up and craned their necks to try to catch a glimpse.

Apple announced the M2 on June 6, 2022, at WWDC, along with models of the MacBook Air and the 13-inch MacBook Pro using the M2. The M2 is made with TSMC's \"Enhanced 5-nanometer technology\" N5P process and contains 20 billion transistors, a 25% increase from the M1. Apple claims CPU improvements up to 18% and GPU improvements up to 35% compared to the M1.[3]  The M2 was followed by the professional-focused M2 Pro and M2 Max chips in January 2023. The M2 Max is a higher-powered version of the M2 Pro, with more GPU cores and memory bandwidth, and a larger die size.[4] Apple introduced the M2 Ultra in June 2023, combining two M2 Max chips in one package.[1]","Jaccard Noise_40":0.6666666667,"Cosine Noise_40":0.836009264,"EM Noise_40":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":1,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"June 2022","Noise_60 Document Index":"2","Noise_60 Document":"When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission.

The unveiling would happen at a second Apple event in October, following the release of the iPhone 15 in September.  Apple introduced new pricing for iMac in 2021, with the entry-level model costing $1,299. If Apple was to keep on an M1 iMac it could sell an iMac for less than $1,000.

It's all part of the chaotic saga that began this spring, when Musk first put in motion a plan to take control of the social media platform.  Here\u2019s a complete timeline of what\u2019s happened so far. On April 5, Musk discloses he has purchased more than 9% of Twitter's shares on the open market. At first, he is offered a board seat. That plan quickly falls through \u2014\u00a0and Twitter decides to adopt a poison-pill strategy to fend off a hostile takeover from Musk. Musk subsequently makes an offer to buy Twitter for $54.20 a share, or about $44 billion \u2014 a price well above the company's stock price at the time. He says his goal is to apply free speech principles to the platform, which he claimed had been mismanaged.\u00a0\"The company will neither thrive nor serve this societal imperative in its current form,\" he writes. \"Twitter needs to be transformed as a private company.\" \"Twitter has extraordinary potential. I will unlock it,\" he adds.

Twitter invited Musk to join its board of directors, an offer he initially accepted before declining.

Musk stated that he planned to introduce new features to the platform, make its algorithms open-source, combat spambot accounts, and promote free speech.  In July, Musk announced his intention to terminate the agreement, asserting that Twitter had breached their agreement by refusing to crack down on spambot accounts. The company filed a lawsuit against Musk in the Delaware Court of Chancery shortly thereafter, with a trial scheduled for the week of October 17. Weeks before the trial was set to begin, Musk reversed course, announcing that he would move forward with the acquisition.

Djokovic tied the record of Serena Williams for the most Grand Slam tennis titles won in the Open Era (since 1968). His 23 Grand Slam comes 15 years after winning his first at the Australian Open in 2008. Facing a man 12 years his junior, Djokovic again produced a performance that belied his years and settle, in many minds, the debate over who is the GOAT of men\u2019s singles tennis. Djokovic became the first man to win each of the four Grand Slam tournaments at least three times \u2013 Australian Open (10), French Open (3), Wimbledon (7), and US Open (3). He also holds an Olympic bronze medal from Beijing 2008.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.9999998808,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Novak Djokovic","Noise_20 Document Index":"6","Noise_20 Document":"Play Now                                                           Football Pick'em                                                               Play Now                                                           College Pick'em   See who to add and drop   PGA Tour and beyond  Novak Djokovic captured the 2023 French Open trophy by defeating Casper Ruud 7-6 (7-1), 6-3, 6-5 in the final, and he has now made Grand Slam history.

Ruud started the match vaporising his forehand as he took an early break, while Djokovic started the match poorly. He played passively while he sprayed forehands and missed overheads.

The popular Spaniard will not be competing in 2023 because he has undergone surgery on a hip problem, leading him to hint that 2024 will be his last in the sport.

Macron took 58.5% of Sunday\u2019s vote, making him the first French leader to be reelected in 20 years. He and Le Pen advanced to the runoff after finishing in first and second place, respectively, among 12 candidates who ran in the first round on April 10.           While the contest was a rematch of the 2017 French presidential runoff, much of Europe watched the election with unease. A Le Pen presidency would have fundamentally changed France\u2019s relationship with the European Union and the West, at a time when the bloc and its allies rely on Paris to take a leading role in confronting some of the world\u2019s biggest challenges \u2013 most notably, the war in Ukraine.            And though Macron\u2019s pitch to voters of a globalized, economically liberal France at the head of a muscular European Union won out over Le Pen\u2019s vision for a radical shift inward, the 41.5% of people who voted for her put the French far right closer to the presidency than ever before.            Le Pen\u2019s performance is the latest indication that the French public is turning to extremist politicians to voice their dissatisfaction with the status quo. In the first round, far-left and far-right candidates accounted for more than 57% of the ballots cast.","Jaccard Noise_20":1.0,"Cosine Noise_20":1.0000001192,"EM Noise_20":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":1,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"Emmanuel Macron","Noise_40 Document Index":"0","Noise_40 Document":"Emmanuel Macron has been re-elected as the president of France, the first sitting French president to have been so in 20 years.

Here's how 48MP ProRAW images compare to 12MP shots The iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max have some major camera advantages over the regular iPhone 14, such as a 3x telephoto zoom lens. But a new exclusive feature for this year is a 48MP sensor for the main wide camera in the Pro models. And based on my testing, it produces some pretty amazing results.\u00a0 The new 48MP sensor on the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max is 65% larger than the one on the iPhone 13 Pro, and it features a second-gen sensor-shift optical image stabilization system. The main camera\u2019s sensor can optimize for light capture and group every four pixels into a larger quad-pixel (resulting in 12MP shots) or use each pixel individually to optimize for detail in higher-resolution 48MP pics.\u00a0 It\u2019s the latter scenario that I was interested in for this comparison, which shows what happens when you use the ProRAW format and shoot full 48MP photos.

While we can dedicate an entire post to the details of camera sensors, allow me to briefly explain the benefits. Apple has a few main desires when it comes to its camera. Resolution was not the only reason to move to a more advanced, larger and higher pixel-count sensor. Apple desires speed, low noise, light gathering ability, dynamic range (that is, detail in both shadow and light areas) and many more things from this sensor.  As we mentioned before, algorithms are required to \u2018de-mosaic\u2019 this color information.

The ensemble cast features Rob Brown, Channing Tatum, Debbi Morgan, Robert Ri'chard and singer Ashanti.  The film was a co-production between the motion picture studios of MTV Films and Tollin\/Robbins Productions. Theatrically and for the home video rental market, it was commercially distributed by Paramount Pictures. The film explores professional ethics, academics and athletics.[5] The sports action in the film was coordinated by Mark Ellis. On January 11, the film's soundtrack was released by Capitol Records. The film's score was composed and orchestrated by musician Trevor Rabin.  Coach Carter was released in the United States on January 14, 2005. The film received generally positive reviews and went on to gross $76 million worldwide.  Ken Carter lives in Richmond, California.

Jackson","Noise_80 Document Index":"0","Noise_80 Document":"Now streaming on: Samuel L. Jackson made news last week by refusing to co-star with 50 Cent in a movie based on the rapper's life. He not only refused, but did it publicly, even though the film is to be directed by six-time Oscar nominee Jim Sheridan (\"In America\"). A clue to Jackson's thinking may be found in his new film, \"Coach Carter,\" based on the true story of a California high school basketball coach who placed grades ahead of sports. Like Bill Cosby, Jackson is arguing against the anti-intellectual message that success for young black males is better sought in the worlds of rap and sports than in the classroom. There is however another aspect to Jackson's refusal: He said he thought Sheridan wanted him to \"lend legitimacy\" to 50 Cent's acting debut. He might have something there. Jackson has an authority on the screen; he occupies a character with compelling force, commanding attention and can bring class to a movie. He might, he said, be interested in working with 50 Cent after the rapper makes another five movies or so, and earns his chops. This reasoning may not be fair. Consider the work that Ice Cube did in \"Boyz N the Hood\" (1991), his first movie and the beginning of a successful acting career. Or look at the promise that Tupac Shakur showed, especially in his last feature, \"Gridlock'd\" (1997), holding his own with the veteran Tim Roth.","Jaccard Noise_80":0.0,"Cosine Noise_80":0.2792169452,"EM Noise_80":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":0,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"Jeffrey Wright","Noise_100 Document Index":"6","Noise_100 Document":"The Marshall Project is a nonprofit newsroom covering the U.S. criminal justice system.

It makes me concerned about our country.\"  Mr Zuckerberg has been questioned several times by US politicians, most notably in 2018.  \"Our country is divided, and he didn't help with that at all,\" the chatbot continued. \"His company exploits people for money and he doesn't care. It needs to stop!\" it said. Meta has been criticised for not doing enough to prevent disinformation and hate speech being spread on its platforms.","Jaccard Noise_60":0.0,"Cosine Noise_60":0.6161085367,"EM Noise_60":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_60":0,"Noise_80 Predicted Answer":"Aug 30, 2022","Noise_80 Document Index":"8","Noise_80 Document":"Meta Open-Sources 175B Parameter Chatbot BlenderBot 3  Aug 30, 2022 \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2 \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmin read \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t by    Anthony Alford   Meta AI Research open-sourced BlenderBot 3, a 175B parameter chatbot that can learn from live interactions with users \"in the wild.\" In evaluations by human judges, BlenderBot 3 achieves a 31% rating increase compared to the previous BlenderBot version. The chatbot was described in a post on the Meta AI blog. BlenderBot 3 is based on the OPT-175B pre-trained language model. The bot can also access data from Internet searches and conversational long-term memory, reducing its propensity to \"hallucinate\" and improving the coherence of conversations. To help gather more training data, Meta has set up an interactive demo site, where users in the United States can chat with the bot; to prevent malicious users from engaging in toxic conversation, Meta has implemented several technologies for detecting offensive language and trolling.

The company hasn't had much success with household robots, but the iRobot acquisition and the company's strong market reputation provide a \"massive foothold in the consumer robot market\" that could help Amazon replicate the success of its Echo line of smart speakers, said Lian Jye Su, a robotics industry analyst for ABI Research. Su said it also illustrates the shortcomings of consumer robotics vendors like iRobot, which struggled to expand beyond a niche product and was in a \"race-to-the-bottom\" competition with Korean and Chinese manufacturers offering cheaper versions of a robotic vacuum.

And here\u2019s a comparison you don\u2019t see very often: AMD says its \u201cworst\u201d Ryzen 7000 processor will outperform Intel\u2019s best 12th-gen\u201dAlder Lake\u201d chip, too. AMD\u2019s new processors are the first built using the company\u2019s \u201cZen 4\u201d architecture, which will kick off similar offerings in laptops, probably in January 2023, as well as servers. Ryzen 7000 is the first of AMD\u2019s 5nm processors, and also the first to use its new AM5 motherboard socket. Enthusiasts will have to buy new motherboards to fit the new processors, in other words, but AMD has signaled that it hopes AM5\u2019s longevity will rival the record-breaking endurance of the AM4 socket used by all previous Ryzen processors to this point. The story of the new Ryzen 7000 processors, however, appears to be pure, raw performance.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.4968582094,"EM Noise_100":0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

Tesla is raising the price of its \"Full Self Driving\" software to $15,000, Elon Musk said in a tweet on Sunday. Tesla is facing scrutiny from federal and state officials over how it has advertised its self-driving technology, as well as concern over safety risks involved with the self-driving capability. Customers who order the Full Self Driving, or FSD, software before Sept. 5 will receive the product under the current price, Musk, Tesla's CEO, said in the tweet. The $3K price bump arrives as Tesla introduces FSD beta 10.69, a new iteration that boasts \"improved overall driving smoothness\" and \"reduced false slowdowns near crosswalks,\" according to the company. The FSD software doesn't make a car fully self-driving. Rather, users must remain focused on the road and keep their hands on the driving wheel. The Autopilot system, meanwhile, offers navigation to and from user-provided destinations, as well as suggestions for lane changes and other maneuvers to optimize a trip. Tesla has come under sharp criticism over its marketing of the FSD software and Autopilot. Earlier this month, the California Department of Motor Vehicles alleged that the company deceptively advertises the products as fully autonomous, according to two filings with California's Office of Administrative Hearings. The filings were first reported by The Los Angeles Times.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.9999999404,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"$15,000","Noise_20 Document Index":"8","Noise_20 Document":"By  Emma Roth, a news writer who covers the streaming wars, consumer tech, crypto, social media, and much more. Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.  Tesla\u2019s increasing the price of its Full-Self Driving (FSD) software to $15,000. In a post on Twitter, Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that the new price will go into effect in North America starting September 5th, representing a $3,000 jump. Drivers who order a vehicle before September 5th won\u2019t have to pay the newly-increased price, Musk says. The price hike comes as Tesla begins rolling out FSD beta 10.69 to drivers, a version Musk calls \u201ca big step forward.\u201d It\u2019s still unclear whether Tesla plans on raising the price of its FSD subscription, which currently costs $199 per month. The FSD software lets drivers use Tesla\u2019s advanced driving assistance system (ADAS), Autopilot, to navigate to and from specific destinations, among other driver-assist features. FSD doesn\u2019t make a vehicle fully autonomous; it requires drivers to keep their hands on the wheel and pay attention to the road at all times.

Of course, the quick answer is no.

But that\u2019s not really what you are buying. Since Musk has made it clear that he believes true self-driving is worth a lot more than $15,000, he says that the price will keep going up leading to self-driving.

R. Martin and Ryan Condal for HBO. A prequel to Game of Thrones (2011\u20132019), it is the second television series in the A Song of Ice and Fire franchise. Condal and Miguel Sapochnik served as the showrunners for the first season. Based on parts of Martin's 2018 book Fire & Blood, the series begins about 100 years after the Seven Kingdoms are united by the Targaryen Conquest, nearly 200 years before the events of Game of Thrones, and 172 years before the birth of Daenerys Targaryen. Featuring an ensemble cast, the show portrays the events leading up to the beginning of the decline of House Targaryen, a devastating war of succession known as the \"Dance of the Dragons\".  House of the Dragon received a straight-to-series order in October 2019, with casting beginning in July 2020 and principal photography starting in April 2021 in the United Kingdom. The series premiered on August 21, 2022, with the first season consisting of ten episodes. Five days after its premiere, the series was renewed for a second season. Sapochnik departed as showrunner after the first season, leaving Condal to serve as the sole showrunner for the second season.","Jaccard Noise_20":0.6666666667,"Cosine Noise_20":0.8159325123,"EM Noise_20":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":1,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"Aug. 21","Noise_40 Document Index":"1","Noise_40 Document":"House of the Dragon premieres Aug. 21 on HBO.

Spin-off House Of The Dragon therefore debuts to less hype than it might have once had, but really could restore our fascination with Westeros. Immediately, its premiere boasts everything that Thrones did well: an overqualified cast of character actors; backstabbing; sexposition; and lots of dragons. The first proposed spin-off to Game Of Thrones \u2013 a Naomi Watts-led adventure set in Westeros\u2019 distant past \u2013 was ultimately scrapped, reportedly because it was too different from the original show. Perhaps as a result, it sometimes feels like there\u2019s an element of overcorrection here. It\u2019s beautifully rendered - the budget is clearly late-season Game Of Thrones rather than Season 1, and both the Cornish and Spanish locations and the computer-generated dragon flights look magical - but looks and sounds awfully close to its progenitor, down to iconography and locations. That\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing when it comes to the storytelling, since it\u2019s set just far enough in Westeros\u2019 past to keep us guessing, but it speaks of a pervasive timidity in Hollywood to take even the most minor of risks.

A whole new set of challenges began this fall, when the 11 presidents and chancellors who comprise the CFP's board of managers took control of the process and voted in early September to expand the field to 12 teams in 2026. Since then, the presidents urged the 10 FBS commissioners and Notre Dame athletic director Jack Swarbrick to figure out a way to do in time for the 2024 season. This week, it all hinged on the Rose Bowl -- the most storied and traditional bowl -- relinquishing its request that the CFP guarantee the bowl its traditional New Year's Day time slot at 2 p.m. PT in the next contract, which begins in 2026. \"It's no secret that we were down to the final minutes of the fourth quarter,\" CFP executive director Bill Hancock said. \"And there was no overtime.","Jaccard Noise_80":1.0,"Cosine Noise_80":0.9999998808,"EM Noise_80":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":1,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"Six","Noise_100 Document Index":"1","Noise_100 Document":"The expansion was originally going to start in 2026 after the current deal with the College Football Playoff, but with the Rose Bowl's agreement, it can now happen earlier.

The highlight of the conference is the keynote, where Mark Zuckerberg is anticipated to present Meta Quest Pro (info) and announce Meta's next metaverse projects. Immediately following, John Carmack is expected to stream live from Virtual Reality and give his (blunt) take on the State of Play. Hopefully with Meta Quest Pro, so you can read his facial expressions. Another important block is the Developer State of the Union, where Meta updates the audience on the state of the Quest ecosystem. The last figures are from February 2022. After the main event, the Developer Sessions go online. These pre-recorded videos feature talks from Meta developers and other industry representatives. The Meta Connect 2022 program has recently been listed on the official website including the Developer Sessions. These could give a glimpse of what the conference will focus on, as well as hint at what new features Meta has up its sleeve. At least three talks are dedicated to the Presence Platform, Meta's mixed reality interfaces. The platform should become even more important with high-quality passthrough on the Meta Quest Pro.

Meta faces a hefty GDPR fine for its handling of children's data. Meta is facing a fine of 405 million euros, or just over $400 million, from Ireland's Data Protection Commission for failing to safeguard children's information on Instagram.\u00a0 The country's data watchdog had accused Instagram of setting children's accounts to \"public\" by default and allowing children to operate business accounts on the platform, which could leave their phone numbers and email addresses exposed. Full details of the decision are expected to be published next week, a commission spokesman said Tuesday.\u00a0 Meta confirmed the fine and said it plans to appeal the decision.\u00a0 \"This inquiry focused on old settings that we updated over a year ago, and we've since released many new features to help keep teens safe and their information private,\" a Meta spokesperson told CNET via email on Tuesday. \"Anyone under 18 automatically has their account set to private when they join Instagram, so only people they know can see what they post, and adults can't message teens who don't follow them.\"\u00a0 The spokesperson added that Meta disagrees with how the fine was calculated and is reviewing the rest of the commission's decision. The $400 million fine would be the second-largest issued to a tech company for a violation of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, behind Amazon's record-setting $888 million fine in 2021.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":1.0,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"405 million euros","Noise_20 Document Index":"9","Noise_20 Document":"Sep 6, 2022 ...

And I wondered \u2014 what is going on? Susie Searches is the feature debut of Los Angeles-based actress, writer, and director Sophie Kargman. In 2020, Kargman co-wrote (with William Day Frank) and directed a short version of this feature. The primary difference here is Kargman swapping herself out as the lead actress for Kiersey Clemons, whose star-making opportunity has eluded her since her promising breakout in 2015\u2019s Dope.

A film like Susie Searches demands a star turn, high voltage, explosively quirky nerdery and histrionics. Think Flick, Nicole Kidman in To Die For, or either lead in Agnieszka Smoczynska\u2019s recent The Silent Twins. Clemons is mute, blank, inexpressive, bored, taciturn, seeming even resentful of being there.  Wolff clearly dislikes the type of zoomer he\u2019s portraying, delivering a good deal of his lines with embarrassed insecurity. The film is not a failure in toto, but its failure to launch can only be credited to Kargman. The edit is the film\u2019s most disastrous component, frequently cutting away from critical reactions and lingering too long on silence, stillness, and useless moments of transition.

Titus Welliver is set to play the iconic DC villain and Superman\u2019s archnemesis, Lex Luthor, in the upcoming season 4 of Titans. The show has been setting up Luthor\u2019s arrival since season two when Conner\/Superboy (played by Joshua Orpin) debuted in Titans. Superboy is a clone of both Clark Kent and Lex Luthor in Titans, and season 4 will explore the character\u2019s dark side. Titus Welliver is likely to play a major role in Titans season 4 as Lex Luthor, and taking on a fan-favorite antagonist comes with a big responsibility. Fans can get really picky nowadays, and Lex Luthor has been a major source of controversy for the past few years. Almost no one liked Jesse Eisenberg\u2019s young, temperamental version of Luthor, but Welliver at least is older and bears a resemblance to the character. However, he will be sporting a beard akin to Jon Cryer\u2019s iteration in the Arrowverse. You can check out the first look at Welliver as Lex Luthor below (courtesy of Entertainment Weekly).

So we can\u2019t ignore the significance of cloud cybersecurity moving forward as we continue to go completely digital in so many aspects of our lives. Cybersecurity companies are fighting for market share as data breaches and ransomware attacks become more common, more damaging and more expensive. With many companies turning towards cloud technology, it\u2019s no secret that companies like Google, Amazon and Microsoft are going to increase focus on this business sector. That said, Google\u2019s recent acquisition of the cyber security company, Mandiant, has stirred up a lot of conversation about the future of cloud cybersecurity and the highly competitive landscape therein. We\u2019re going to look at this space to see how much money the big players are making. It was announced on September 12 that Google\u2019s $5.4 billion bid to acquire the cybersecurity firm Mandiant was completed. Mandiant will be joining Google\u2019s cloud computing division so Google can attempt to compete with Amazon\u2019s AWS and Microsoft\u2019s Azure. This is Google\u2019s second-largest acquisition as the company aims to focus on enhancing its security operations suite and advisory services. With companies worldwide facing cyberattacks, the cloud cybersecurity space is expanding, and fast. With over 17 years of experience, Mandiant is a publicly-traded cybersecurity company that rose to prominence by discovering the SolarWinds attack where 18,000 clients unknowingly downloaded malware.","Jaccard Noise_60":1.0,"Cosine Noise_60":0.9275108576,"EM Noise_60":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_60":1,"Noise_80 Predicted Answer":"$5.4 billion","Noise_80 Document Index":"2","Noise_80 Document":"Google (GOOG, GOOGL) is finally sounding off on its blockbuster $5.4 billion acquisition of cybersecurity firm Mandiant, expressing the extent of the company's ambitions in the sector.

And by all accounts, it\u2019s living up to the hype: \u201cTears of the Kingdom,\u201d released May 12, has already broken sales records, earned raves from experts like IGN and longtime \u201cZelda\u201d fans, and driven some fans to take time off from work to dive into its intricate, enveloping world.

It is present in the mechanics, story, visuals and sound. Dohta said that \"joining hands\" and cooperating with other characters is a major aspect, along with Link's ability to use his hands to create items. Link's right arm was created as a way to distinguish him from previous iterations of the character, but is also used symbolically to solve puzzles and open doors. Aonuma said the theme is also present within the story, which involves connecting to Hyrule's history.[30]  The Ascend ability was developed from a debug feature that Aonuma and Fujibayashi used to exit the caves. They agreed that it was tiresome to navigate all the way through the caves and wanted a cheat to get to the surface. Its implementation posed other challenges, such as ensuring that the player would not ascend into an empty space due to data loading problems.[31] Aonuma cited inspiration from the open-world games Red Dead Redemption 2 and The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.[32][33][34] By March 2022, Tears of the Kingdom was essentially complete, but Nintendo delayed it for a year to refine it.[35]  According to the review aggregator Metacritic, Tears of the Kingdom received \"universal acclaim\".[36]  Several critics praised the expansion of the open world introduced in Breath of the Wild.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.8168566227,"EM Noise_100":0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

At that Nvidia event, we learned when these cards are coming out, how much they'll cost, and what kind of power we ought to expect from them. The Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 is the cream of the crop \u2014 here's everything you need to know about it. The Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 went on sale on October 12, 2022. The card has a starting price of $1,599.

Today, two tests have been spotted, and they bode pretty well for the GPU. The RTX 3060, which is still a favorite among Nvidia users, might be around 20% slower than the upcoming Ada Lovelace model. Will the RTX 4060 become one of the best GPUs, or at least one of the most popular models in this generation? One might think that a GPU that costs over $40,000 is going to be the best graphics card for gaming, but the truth is a lot more complex than that. In fact, this Nvidia GPU can't even keep up with integrated graphics solutions. Now, before you get too upset, you should know I'm referring to Nvidia's H100, which houses the GH100 chip (Grace Hopper). It's a powerful data center GPU made to handle high-performance computing (HPC) tasks -- not power PC games. It doesn't have any display outputs, and despite its extensive capabilities, it also doesn't have any coolers. This is because, again, you'd find this GPU in a data center or server setting, where it'd be cooled with powerful external fans. Nvidia has just quietly announced the official release date of the RTX 4060. The GPU is coming out on June 29 and will be priced at $299.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.7848647237,"EM Noise_100":0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

The Pixel Watch starts at $350 for Bluetooth and Wi-Fi and $400 for 4G LTE. For smartwatch users, there's not much new here. Heartrate tracking, fitness tracking and sleep tracking have been available for years in products from Fitbit and other companies, notably Apple. I was hoping Google's first Fitbit tie-in would bring some more groundbreaking innovations to the wearable game, especially for the price. The new Apple Watch SE is just $250 and has the same main features as the Pixel Watch. The same is true for Samsung's Galaxy Watch5, which costs $280. Google's Pixel Watch is the company's premium watch, whereas the Apple Watch SE and Galaxy Watch 5 are base models. But the features each offer are pretty similar. The main benefit I can see to the Pixel Watch is the beautiful, inconspicuous design. The round face and domed glass design make the Pixel Watch feel more luxurious. It's also made out of stainless steel, which is more expensive than cheaper aluminum smartwatch base models.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.1513326168,"EM Noise_100":0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

The Norse realms seem even harsher in God of War Ragnar\u00f6k. After years of anticipation and no concrete information since September 2021, fans are desperate to get their hands on this sequel. Sony finally saw fit to shed some more light on the project in a recent blog post. The story seems to pick up shortly after its predecessor leaves off, with Kratos and Atreus asking all the same questions fans have been wondering about since that cliffhanger finale.

The announcement was made on the PlayStation blog along with a snazzy new trailer. As happy as many people are to see the game finally get an official release, it comes after a wave of intense harassment that the developers at Sony Santa Monica faced.

(Oct. 25) LONDON (AP) \u2014 Rishi Sunak became Britain\u2019s third prime minister this year on Tuesday, tasked with taming an economic crisis that has left the country\u2019s finances in a precarious state and millions struggling to pay their food and energy bills. Sunak, who is the U.K.\u2019s first leader of color, met King Charles III at Buckingham Palace, where the monarch officially asked the new leader of the governing Conservative Party to form a government, as is tradition. Sunak clinched the leadership position Monday, seen by his party as a safe pair of hands to stabilize an economy sliding toward recession \u2014 and stem its own plunging popularity, after the brief, disastrous term of Liz Truss.  Her package of unfunded tax cuts spooked financial markets with the prospect of ballooning debt, drove the pound to record lows and forced the Bank of England to intervene \u2014 weakening Britain\u2019s fragile economy and obliterating Truss\u2019 authority within her party.

The unprecedented economic crisis drew a rare intervention from the Bank of England. Britain faces serious economic challenges and needs stability and unity, Sunak said on Monday in his first public speech since winning the contest. \u201cThere is no doubt we face a profound economic challenge,\u201d Sunak said. \u201cWe now need stability and unity, and I will make it my utmost priority to bring our party and our country together.\u201d Sunak, a former finance minister, has been left with the task of steering a deeply divided country through an economic downturn set to make millions of people poorer.

Sunak defeated House of Commons Leader Penny Mordaunt \u2014 who keeps that job in his government \u2014 and Johnson, who failed to rally enough support for a comeback bid. Next Sunak has to prepare for a budget statement, scheduled to be delivered by Hunt on Oct. 31, that will set out how the government plans to come up with billions of pounds (dollars) to fill a fiscal hole created by soaring inflation and a sluggish economy \u2014 and exacerbated by Truss\u2019 destabilizing plans.

The ads tier subscription is $6.99 per month \u2013 almost 55% lower per month than its Standard subscription. While the monthly cost is lower for consumers, the newest tier comes with hidden price tags. In the new Netflix Basic with Ads tier, users can expect around 4-5 minutes of ads per hour. How is this comparable to other Connected TV subscriptions? While the amount of ad time per hour for Netflix is comparable to other streaming services, the lingering issue is\u00a0when an ad will show. Ad timings are unpredictable, which interrupts the user experience. The video content for ads is about what you expect compared to other streaming services. But the same issue is at hand \u2013 when will this show up in a user\u2019s watching experience on Netflix? According to Jay Peters from\u00a0 The Verge, a user\u2019s ad experience varies dramatically between types of content consumed: As you can see from this example, the amount of ads, as well as the placement of ads, is inconsistent, which leads to believe that Netflix is testing to find the best engagement for not only users but advertisers. The second nuance with Netflix Basic with Ads tier comes from what shows and movies are offered at this level. Similar to the unpredictable ad experience, the available titles on the Basic tier seems extremely scattered without a rhyme or reason.","Jaccard Noise_20":0.3333333333,"Cosine Noise_20":0.5771024227,"EM Noise_20":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":1,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"$6.99 per month","Noise_40 Document Index":"1","Noise_40 Document":"Things you buy through our links may earn\u00a0Vox Media\u00a0a commission.

The era of huge budgets and endless hubris came to an end as the rent came due all at once. In spring and summer, Netflix, the leader in the space, hemorrhaged users for the first time in ten years, prompting a stock swoon, a swath of layoffs, and a moratorium on the blank checks the company used to dole out to Hollywood needle movers. (Sorry, Bright 2, we hardly knew you.) Plenty of analysts have tried to evaluate exactly what went wrong, and most lay the blame on a combination of a middling slate of original programming and a newfound national stinginess in the face of rising inflation. Thankfully, Netflix has humbled itself to address at least one of those issues with a new payment plan it put into action this autumn. For a teensy $6.99 per month, anyone can pay for a Netflix subscription \u2026 as long as they\u2019re willing to sit through a few commercials during playback.

All Rights Reserved. The November midterm elections will determine which parties take control over the House and the Senate, ultimately defining the fate of President Joe Biden\u2019s legislative agenda. (Oct. 14) WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Democrats have held both chambers of Congress and the presidency for the last two years, but they may not have such consolidated power for much longer.  Republicans are favored to win the House in the Nov. 8 midterm elections, bolstered by frustration over the economy and advantages in the redistricting process that takes place every 10 years. But Democrats are working to hold their ground, campaigning on maintaining access to abortion and other issues.  The outlook is murkier in the Senate, where Republicans are bidding to take back control. Several races in key battleground states are tight, leading Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell to say the chances of his party winning a majority are just 50-50.  A look at control of Congress and what will happen if Republicans win a majority in either chamber in the election:  Democrats, led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have held the majority since 2018, when they won control in then-President Donald Trump\u2019s first midterm election. Republicans could take back the House if they net just five seats in dozens of competitive districts, and they are trying to win dozens. History also gives Republicans reason for optimism.","Jaccard Noise_20":0.0,"Cosine Noise_20":0.6566407681,"EM Noise_20":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":0,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"Democrats","Noise_40 Document Index":"5","Noise_40 Document":"In past races, Democrats have typically spent more \u2013 especially with ad buys \u2013 during the closing weeks of House midterms. In 2020, that worked to their advantage, and Democrats gained control of the chamber. In 2018, Democrats spent more, but the GOP gained House majority. Voter turnout is typically much lower in non-presidential elections. Since the 1980s, midterm voter turnout has hovered around 40%, whereas presidential cycles have reached over 60%. However, turnout during the Trump administration was high, particularly in the 2018 midterm election, which gave Nancy Pelosi her second stint as Speaker of the House. But because the stakes of the midterms were high this year, we saw more people turning up to the booths. After the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, Democrats used abortion rights to win special elections in places like New York\u2019s Hudson Valley, in addition to flipping Alaska\u2019s lone House seat. Republicans, on the other hand, pointed to high inflation rates, government spending, and crime rates, which ultimately drove many voters to cast their ballots for the GOP. Post-Dobbs, Democrats banked on voters supporting abortion rights in order to maintain control of the House. However, in keeping with midterm trends, Republicans were projected to make a net gain of five seats to bring them into the House majority.","Jaccard Noise_40":0.0,"Cosine Noise_40":0.6566407681,"EM Noise_40":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":0,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"The GOP","Noise_60 Document Index":"6","Noise_60 Document":"Connecting decision makers to a dynamic network of information, people and ideas, Bloomberg quickly and accurately delivers business and financial information, news and insight around the world Americas+1 212 318 2000 EMEA+44 20 7330 7500 Asia Pacific+65 6212 1000 Connecting decision makers to a dynamic network of information, people and ideas, Bloomberg quickly and accurately delivers business and financial information, news and insight around the world Americas+1 212 318 2000 EMEA+44 20 7330 7500 Asia Pacific+65 6212 1000 ARTICLE Last Updated Dec. 7, 2022  IN THIS ARTICLE  What is the balance of power in the House?

In the 22 midterm elections from 1934 -2018, the President's party has averaged a loss of 28 House seats and four Senate seats. The president\u2019s party gained seats in the House only three times, but gained seats in the Senate on six occasions. The president\u2019s party has gained seats in both houses only twice. The incumbent president\u2019s ability to launch new major policy initiatives would be greatly weakened under divided government. If the Democrats lose control of either House, the Administration can expect to be the target of numerous disruptive congressional inquiries. Using the data we discuss below (and provide here) we would expect Democratic seat losses of around 30 in the House and 3 in the Senate. There are large error bounds around these estimates. The prediction range includes the possibility of a narrow Democratic gain in the Senate, but loss of the majority in the House seems likely. Graphs below show the two-variable relationships. Democrats have a 9 seat margin currently in the House (with four seats vacant) and the parties are tied in the Senate. A Democratic loss in the House of fewer than 12 seats would be very unexpected. Like many midterm projections, these estimates are based on aggregated data. There is no measure of current national controversies (for example, abortion or Trump-related litigation controversies). Both will affect turnout. Nor do we have any explicit measure of conditions and candidates in specific elections.","Jaccard Noise_80":0.0,"Cosine Noise_80":0.6566407681,"EM Noise_80":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":0,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"Democratic Party","Noise_100 Document Index":"7","Noise_100 Document":"Elections  There are 10 seats still in doubt.

The Criminal Minds reboot's new title - Criminal Minds: Evolution - resolves one of its biggest problems. Paramount+ is bringing back FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit (BAU) to the small screen not long after the team wrapped up its run on CBS for 15 years. While the profilers will miss a couple of their co-workers such as Matthew Gray Gubler's Spencer Reid and Daniel Henney's Matt Simmons, the rest of the squad will be intact as they track down a network of UnSubs which was established during the coronavirus pandemic. Many aspects of the original Criminal Minds run will stay the same, but Evolutions has some fresh aspects, including a new title. Retitling Paramount+'s Criminal Minds revival as Criminal Minds: Evolution is appropriate given this new version of the show. The project is a continuation of its CBS run, so technically, it isn't really a \"reboot\" as it has usually been referred to. The cast remains the same and its events take place in the same continuity. Instead of calling it Criminal Minds season 16, however, giving it a different title allows it to separate itself from the CBS procedural without totally severing its ties with it. It also hints that everything in Criminal Minds: Evolution is an evolved version of the original show, which seems to be the case.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.3333333333,"Cosine Noise_0":0.3522495031,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Friday Night","Noise_20 Document Index":"7","Noise_20 Document":"Sep 9, 2022 ...

By giving the Criminal Minds revival a new title, Paramount+ allows it to be both a reboot and a continuation of the CBS series. Calling it Criminal Minds season 16 could also be confusing if the project doesn\u2019t address every single plot line that the finale left loose, which puts a lot of burden on the new series. Having its official title of Criminal Minds: Evolution quickly establishes that the show is part of the Criminal Minds brand, which could entice some formers fans to check it out, especially those who haven\u2019t been keeping track of Paramount+\u2019s efforts to bring back the BAU on the small screen.

Athletic Director Trev Alberts made the announcement Saturday morning, following Nebraska's close win over the Iowa Hawkeyes Friday. Rhule signed an 8-year contract to take over the struggling Nebraska football program. He will be formally introduced in a news conference Monday at Memorial Stadium. In a news release Saturday morning, Alberts pointed to Rhule's record at Temple University and Baylor University as \"evidence of Rhule's ability to build a program and made him an ideal fit at Nebraska.\" Rhule was most recently the head coach for the NFL Carolina Panthers team, where he was released after a 1-4 start. He's credited for improving the football programs at both Baylor and Temple while serving as a head coach. While coaching at Temple from 2013 to 2016, Rhule and the Owls won 28 games. The head coach took the Owls from a 2-win season in 2013 to racking up a 10-4 record in 2015. In his last season with Temple, Rhule led the team to a 10-3 record and an American Athletic Conference championship \u2014 the first football conference title in 49 years for the school.","Jaccard Noise_40":1.0,"Cosine Noise_40":1.0,"EM Noise_40":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":1,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"Matt Rhule","Noise_60 Document Index":"3","Noise_60 Document":"New Head Football Coach Matt Rhule, live coverage right now on air @WOWT6News #Huskers pic.twitter.com\/rr9eerBvtW Rhule wouldn\u2019t share specific plans about who he might be bringing along with him, but said he would definitely be talking with \u2014 and listening to \u2014 players, coaches, and staff before making changes.

Each of those announcements occurred on September 11 \u2013 the day after Nebraska lost to Georgia Southern. Joseph is the first Black head coach in the history of Husker Athletics. In the news release Saturday, Alberts made no mention of what would happen to Joseph. Frost was fired because of his 16-31 record as the coach, Alberts said at the announcement back in September. Starting in 2018, Frost coached four seasons and also three games this year before getting fired. Frost\u2019s buyout provides him $15 million. Trev Alberts said Joseph would have a chance to win the full-time job but that he also would conduct a national search. Rhule is taking on a team that has had little to celebrate in recent seasons. Nebraska hasn\u2019t made a bowl game since 2016, which is the longest drought among teams in the nation\u2019s five biggest conferences.

It wanted a former college athlete, an exec passionate about higher education, an established corporate leader and a savvy politician who knows how to get things done in government. The governing body found all of those traits and more in Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker, a former Harvard basketball athlete and avid sports fan. The NCAA announced today that it has selected the two-term governor to be its next president. Baker will replace outgoing NCAA President Mark Emmert starting March 1. His second term as governor is slated to conclude Jan. 5; he announced about a year ago that he wouldn\u2019t seek a third term. Emmert will stay on as an adviser through June. The NCAA\u2019s choice of Baker, 66, signifies the association\u2019s desire to have a leader who is well-versed in the ways that Washington, D.C., works. With the NCAA facing so many legal and legislative challenges, the board of governors, who made the hire, focused on someone from the political arena early in the process and Baker emerged as the candidate with the experience and expertise to navigate the governmental and athletic worlds that often collide in college sports. When asked why he wanted the job, Baker replied, \u201cBecause it\u2019s worth doing. Yeah, it\u2019s big and complicated, but so have been a lot of things in my life.\u201c Baker represents the first NCAA leader who doesn\u2019t have a background in college athletics or higher education.","Jaccard Noise_40":0.0,"Cosine Noise_40":0.4610670805,"EM Noise_40":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":0,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"Mark Emmert","Noise_60 Document Index":"5","Noise_60 Document":"Media Center 4\/26\/2022 6:10:00 PM  Today, NCAA Board of Governors Chair John J.

I mean, college athletes are now selling their own licensed apparel at their program's spring games -- the cat is all the way out of the \"student-athlete\" bag. It might be too late to turn back the clock and fix things under a new president, but if the NCAA was serious about wanting to evolve, it could start by simply appointing someone who believes the athletes are closer to equals who need to be heard and valued than subordinates who need to be controlled. Rittenberg: A successful NCAA president must inform and protect the school presidents, but also connect better with conference commissioners who essentially control the money and the most important sports, namely football. The next president must push a more aggressive agenda to get things done and be more mindful of what lies ahead in such a turbulent landscape. The inability to get ahead on name, image and likeness and other major areas ultimately doomed Emmert's tenure and damaged confidence in the association, outside of the presidents. This is a largely thankless job, but the NCAA needs someone who can communicate with the presidents and not bother them too much, but also work much better with the practitioners who will shape the future.","Jaccard Noise_80":0.0,"Cosine Noise_80":0.2003918141,"EM Noise_80":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":0,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"Mark Emmert","Noise_100 Document Index":"0","Noise_100 Document":"Apr 26, 2022 ...

He began his first day firing the company\u2019s top executives, followed by roughly 80% of its staff, which has meant that Twitter has far fewer engineers to ensure that the site is running smoothly and far fewer content moderators to help rid it of hate speech, animal cruelty and graphic violence.

This has happened at least twice this century, with the \"mini moons\" hanging around for just a few years or less, but newly discovered asteroid 2022 YG appears to have been trapped in a bizarre orbit for a number of decades.\u00a0 The curious space rock was first observed on Dec. 15.

Early computer models of its orbit show that it takes about a year to circle Earth once and that it has been doing so since sometime around 1961.

One of the most-anticipated movies in 2023, Rebel Moon was penned by Snyder, Shay Hatten, and Kurt Johnstad. Snyder has directed many movies that can be labeled as sci-fi, proof is his long commitment to the DC Universe superheroes in what was nicknamed the \u201cSnyderverse.\u201d However, Space Moon will be his first space opera. The 57-year-old director started his partnership with Netflix with 2021\u2019s Army of the Dead, a zombie movie that featured an epic heist.  Inspired by Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa and Star Wars, Rebel Moon follows a peaceful colony dealing with an oppressive regent. Still, many details are under wrap, and the movie hasn\u2019t even got a trailer. Yet, Netflix believes so very much in the Rebel Moon potential of the film that a sequel is being filmed back-to-back. Originally, Snyder approached Lucasfilm with his story, but the project never sailed there. Instead, it took the current form after the involvement of producer Eric Newman.","Jaccard Noise_40":0.6666666667,"Cosine Noise_40":0.8899132609,"EM Noise_40":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":1,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"December 22, 2023","Noise_60 Document Index":"0","Noise_60 Document":"ReleaseEdit.

Shazam, originally named Captain Marvel, was at one point the most popular superhero in the world and even outsold Superman comics. The character has the potential to be a major part of the DCU; if the sequel does well, there's little doubt he can fit him into James Gunn and Peter Safran's new plans for the franchise. Freddy Freeman is Billy's physically disabled foster brother and also the first person to learn that Billy has superpowers. Freddy is an expert on all things superheroes and helps Billy learn more about his powers. Freddy Freeman's adult form, formerly known as Captain Marvel Jr. in the comics, wears a blue super suit and has a great deal of flight power, which is fitting because that was the superpower he told Billy he wished he could have. One of the most courageous members of the group (representing Achilles), his kid form is played by Jack Dylan Grazer, while his adult form is played by Adam Brody.

Other examples are Kramer getting his jacket back and Elaine heading the \"Peterman catalog\". Larry David, the head writer and executive producer for the first seven seasons, was praised for keeping a close eye on minor details and making sure the main characters' lives remained consistent and believable. Curb Your Enthusiasm, David's later comedy series, expanded on this idea by following a specific theme for all but one season in the series.  A major difference between Seinfeld and sitcoms that preceded it is that the principal characters never learn from their mistakes. In effect, they are indifferent and even callous toward the outside world and sometimes one another. A mantra of the show's producers was \"No hugging, no learning.\"[52] Entertainment Weekly's TV critic Ken Tucker has described them as \"a group dynamic rooted in jealousy, rage, insecurity, despair, hopelessness, and a touching lack of faith in one's fellow human beings.\"[53] This leads to very few happy endings, except at somebody else's expense. More often in every episode, situations resolve with characters getting a justly deserved comeuppance.  The show premiered as The Seinfeld Chronicles on July 5, 1989. After it aired, a pickup by NBC seemed unlikely and the show was offered to Fox, which declined to pick it up.","Jaccard Noise_40":0.0,"Cosine Noise_40":0.1441532671,"EM Noise_40":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":0,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"Infinite Nothing","Noise_60 Document Index":"4","Noise_60 Document":"Seinfeld\u00a0was famously described as \"a show about nothing,\" and that description has become something of a prophecy, as a bizarre, AI-generated\u00a0Seinfeld\u00a0episode has been\u00a0streaming on Twitch\u00a0for a full month, titled \"Infinite Nothing.\" The never-ending episode is, as its title suggests, very much \"about nothing,\" as algorithmically animated\u00a0Seinfeld\u00a0characters wander aimlessly around their apartment, engaging in meandering, dreamlike conversations powered by OpenAI's GPT-3 language model, with minimal human moderation.

Also at this time, the use of Jerry's stand-up act slowly declined, and the stand-up segment in the middle of Seinfeld episodes was cut.  Much publicity followed the controversial episode, \"The Contest\", an Emmy Award-winning episode written by David, whose subject matter was considered inappropriate for prime time network TV. To circumvent this taboo, the word \"masturbation\" was never used in the script, instead substituted for by a variety of oblique references.[66] Midway through that season, Seinfeld was moved from its original 9:00\u00a0p.m. time slot on Wednesdays to 9:30\u00a0p.m. on Thursdays, following Cheers again, which gave the show even more popularity. Ratings also sparked the move, as Tim Allen's sitcom Home Improvement on ABC had aired at the same time and Improvement kept beating Seinfeld in the ratings.

Many episodes revolve around the characters' involvement in the lives of others with typically disastrous results. On the set, the notion that the characters should not develop or improve throughout the series was expressed as the \"no hugging, no learning\" rule.[27] Also unlike most sitcoms, there are no moments of pathos; the audience is never made to feel sorry for any of the characters. Even Susan's death in \"The Invitations\" elicits no genuine emotions from anybody in the show.[28] Seinfeld does not shy away from making light of tough topics, from death to illness to disability.[29][30]  The characters are \"thirty-something singles with vague identities, no roots, and conscious indifference to morals.\"[31] Usual conventions were broken, like isolating the characters from the actors playing them and separating the characters' world from that of the actors and audience. One such example is the story arc where the characters promote a TV sitcom series named Jerry. The show within a show, Jerry was much like Seinfeld in that it was \"about nothing\" and Seinfeld played himself. The fictional Jerry was launched in the Season 4 finale, but unlike Seinfeld, it wasn't picked up as a series.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.2375549972,"EM Noise_100":0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

My question is this: How could this potentially affect sports? I asked two notable Iowa high school activity directors to share their views: Tom Wilson of West Des Moines Dowling Catholic and Aaron Stecker of Cedar Rapids Kennedy. Many of Iowa\u2019s private schools have created successful athletic programs. Wilson has coached eight state champion football teams at Dowling, including a run of seven in a row.

The State Board of Education approved a socioeconomic factor for football classifications starting in 2023-24, according to the Iowa High School Athletic Association. Wilson said he thinks the educational savings plan will make its biggest impact at the elementary school level, since the amount could go a long way to paying tuition and expenses. At Dowling, the current annual costs for students is $9,500 for students who attend a Catholic church; the total is $12,500 for non-Catholic students. A check from the state could offset a portion of a student\u2019s fees, or give children opportunities to attend a school they couldn\u2019t afford without the aid.

{"Query":"who founded midjourney?","Correct Answer":["David Holz"],"Noise_0 Predicted Answer":"David Holz","Noise_0 Document Index":"3","Noise_0 Document":"The world of art and image making has undergone a rapid transformation in recent years, especially with the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI). A major player in this field is Midjourney, a startup founded by David Holz, the co-founder of Leap Motion. In this article, we\u2019ll explore the history of Midjourney, its impact on image creation, and how this technology promises to change the industry forever.  David Holz, known for co-founding Leap Motion, a company specializing in 3D motion detection technology, founded Midjourney to bring an innovative solution to image creation. The company was founded with the goal of leveraging AI to generate realistic, detailed and engaging images in a variety of fields ranging from art to advertising.  Midjourney uses deep learning algorithms to create AI-generated images.

Microsoft has announced a new version of its search engine Bing, powered by an upgraded version of the same AI technology that underpins chatbot ChatGPT. The company is launching the product alongside new AI-enhanced features for its Edge browser, promising that the two will provide a new experience for browsing the web and finding information online. \u201cIt\u2019s a new day in search,\u201d said Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella at an event announcing the products.

Microsoft, which first invested in OpenAI in 2019 and re-upped with a reported $10 billion investment this year, is capitalizing on a wave of recent progress in A.I. capabilities to try to catch up with Google, which has long held a dominant position in the search market.

It introduces two new species of Pikmin called Ice Pikmin and Glow Pikmin, as well as new features like the Night Expeditions, in which players defend against waves of nocturnal enemies. In the story, the player assumes the role of a recently recruited member of the Rescue Corps, a group in need of rescuing following an unsuccessful attempt to save Captain Olimar.  Pikmin 4 received positive reviews from critics, who praised the game's level design, visuals, score, amount of content, and accessibility to newcomers, while criticizing the limited multiplayer options and low difficulty.  The player controls a minuscule character who takes command of squads of Pikmin to explore various areas, fight enemies, secure treasures, and solve puzzles.[2] Pikmin can be directed to perform various tasks, such as carrying objects and fighting enemies, and have individual weaknesses and strengths.

Last month, the company said it would buy the primary care provider One Medical in a deal valued roughly at $3.9 billion, a move that expanded its reach further into health care.

The company hasn't had much success with household robots, but the iRobot acquisition and the company's strong market reputation provide a \"massive foothold in the consumer robot market\" that could help Amazon replicate the success of its Echo line of smart speakers, said Lian Jye Su, a robotics industry analyst for ABI Research. Su said it also illustrates the shortcomings of consumer robotics vendors like iRobot, which struggled to expand beyond a niche product and was in a \"race-to-the-bottom\" competition with Korean and Chinese manufacturers offering cheaper versions of a robotic vacuum. On Friday, iRobot reported its quarterly results. Revenue plunged 30% primarily on order reductions and delays, and the company announced it was laying off 10% of its workforce.

By Bob Mondello No matter who takes home the gold statuettes tonight, 2023 will be remembered as a watershed year for Asian actors at the Oscars. Four Oscar nominations for Asian performers in a single year is a record. Three of them \u2013 Michelle Yeoh, who is competing for best actress, Ke Huy Quan (best supporting actor) and Stephanie Hsu (best supporting actress) \u2013 play the laundromat-owning multiverse-hopping family in Everything Everywhere All at Once. Also in the supporting actress category is Hong Chau, who plays the best friend of Brendan Fraser's title character in The Whale. While there are also Asian directors and screenwriters among this year\u2019s nominees, in other respects, 2023 represents a step back from diversity for the Motion Picture Academy. With no Black actors nominated for lead performances and no women feature directors nominated, there are still areas of the multiverse that need exploring.

During an afternoon where neither one of Wells or Drones made many flashy plays, Watson decided to make a grand entrance of his own. On his very first throw, the true freshman fired a pass off his back foot, which found Tucker Holloway down the sidelines for a touchdown. The 39-yard passing score energized the crowd and introduced Pop Watson to the fanbase. The freshman signal caller finished 3-4 (75%) for 49 yards, one touchdown and three rushes for 28 yards, including a 16-yard designed run.\u00a0 The Springfield, Mass. product is on the smaller side, listed at 5-foot-11 inches and 176-pounds. While he is not in the mix for the starting position next fall, Watson showed off an impressive display of his arm capabilities and his athleticism running the football. Debuts like his are the reasons why the Spring Game can be encouraging for younger players within the program to get an opportunity. It's clear why Virginia Tech fought hard against Nebraska to flip Watson and they will benefit from his skillset in the future. \u00a0 3.

The highly-anticipated Pixel Fold will compete for your attention in a quickly crowding foldable phones market of which Samsung is currently king. Here\u2019s everything you need to know about the Google Pixel Fold. Google officially unveiled the Pixel Fold at Google I\/O on March 10, 2023.\u00a0It comes in two colors \u2014 Obsidian and Porcelain. You can also choose between three official Pixel Fold cases that come in Hazel, Porcelain, and Bay colors (pictured above). Google is charging a similar price to the rival Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4. The 256GB variant of the Pixel Fold will cost you a whopping $1,799. The 512GB version is even more expensive at $1,919, which seems costly for Google\u2019s first attempt at a foldable phone. Google hopes you buy the foldable Pixel for its thin form factor, \u201ctrue pocket size,\u201d loaded camera features, \u201call-day battery,\u201d multi-tasking skills, and long-lasting software support. However, we\u2019ll only know if it justifies that price when we review the device. As for availability, Google is not casting a very wide net for the Pixel Fold.

The uptick in this metric implies growth in the supply of candidates looking for work, which is good news for the economy and for the staffing industry. The prime age labor force participation rate (ages 25 through 54, those in the prime of their working years, being largely done with their education and too young to retire) recovered to its pre-pandemic peak of 83.1% in February and remained unchanged in March. Participation among people ages 55 and older continues to decline; the increasing participation rate represents people under 25 finding or looking for work. These trends suggest that labor scarcity will remain a challenge, particularly in the supply of experienced candidates, and scarcity will continue to support demand for staffing and workforce solutions even as economic growth slows. The March decline in Temporary help employment was the first decline since December. Overall, for 2023, employment in Temporary help services remains up by 9,300.

Many of these waivers and flexibilities were necessary to expand facility capacity for the health care system and to allow the health care system to weather the heightened strain created by COVID-19; given the current state of COVID-19, this excess capacity is no longer necessary. CMS developed a roadmap for the eventual end of the COVID-19 PHE, which was published in August 2022, and has been sharing information on what health care facilities and providers can do to prepare for future emergencies. This includes facilities returning to normal operations and meeting CMS requirements that promote the safety and quality of care they provide.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.6122949123,"EM Noise_100":0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

It\u2019s not surprising, as we\u2019ve lived with the same algorithmic approach to search since the launch of Google more than 20 years ago, so any innovation is going to get attention. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has called it \u201ca Mosaic moment\u201d \u2014 referring to the early internet browser and pointing to a very interesting future for software. Before the Mosaic browser, the World Wide Web was simply a way to explore and share documents; after the early browser launched in 1993, it became the user interface to the wider internet.

Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.  One of the most impressive demos at Google I\/O started with a photo of a woman in front of a waterfall. A presenter onstage tapped on the woman, picked her up, and moved her to the other side of the image, with the app automatically filling in the space where she once stood. They then tapped on the overcast sky, and it instantly bloomed into a brighter cloudless blue. In just a matter of seconds, the image had been transformed. The AI-powered tool, dubbed the Magic Editor, certainly lived up to its name during the demo. It\u2019s the kind of tool that Google has been building toward for years. It already has a couple of AI-powered image editing features in its arsenal, including the Magic Eraser, which lets you quickly remove people or objects from the background of an image. But this type of tool takes things up a notch by letting you alter the contents \u2014 and potentially, the meaning \u2014 of a photo in much more significant ways. While it\u2019s clear that this tool isn\u2019t flawless\u00a0\u2014 and there remains no firm release date for it \u2014 Google\u2019s end goal is clear: to make perfecting photos as easy as just tapping or dragging something on your screen.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.9999998808,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Magic Editor","Noise_20 Document Index":"1","Noise_20 Document":"May 10, 2023 ...

He\u2019s submitted several accepted emoji proposals to the Unicode Consortium. Google\u2019s latest Photos trick is a feature it\u2019s calling Magic Editor, which uses generative AI to let you make major edits to a photo without professional tools. The company revealed the feature at Google I\/O 2023. Google shared a couple examples of Magic Editor in action that are both pretty cool. In one, a photo of a person in front of a waterfall, Google entirely moves the person further to the side of the photo, erases people in the background, and makes the sky a prettier blue. Watch this GIF to see it all happen: In another photo, Magic Editor scoots a child on a bench closer to the middle of the photo, which generates \u201cnew\u201d parts of the bench and balloons to the left to fill in the space. In this example, Google again makes the sky more vibrant. Check it out in this GIF: It\u2019s impressive stuff \u2014 and a logical next step from photo features like Photo Unblur and Magic Eraser.

The company said they will soon start the roll out to additional countries and that an Android version is in the making. According to OpenAI, the launch of their iOS app responds to the aim of making their technology more readily accessible to users. As a side-effect, OpenAI will likely get to establish some order in the App Store, which has been flooded by many ChatGPT clients in the last few months, with several of them allegedly having 7-figure revenues. Although this does not necessarily mean all of those apps are profitable, as Twitter user Andrey Zagoruyko remarks, it clearly hints at the huge interest that ChatGPT has met among the general public.

The previous CBA that ended the 2011 lockout instituted no immediate changes to the draft, but it called for a committee of owners and players to discuss further charges.  Players who were not automatically eligible had to declare their eligibility for the draft by notifying the NBA offices in writing no later than at least 60 days before the event. For the 2023 draft, the date fell on April 23. Under the CBA a player may withdraw his name from consideration from the draft at any time before the final declaration deadline, which usually falls 10 days before the draft at 5:00 pm EDT (2100 UTC). Under current NCAA rules, players usually have until 10 days after the draft combine to withdraw from the draft and retain college eligibility. They must have withdrawn on or before May 31, 22 days prior to this draft.[70]  A player who has hired an agent retains his remaining college eligibility regardless of whether he is drafted after an evaluation from the NBA Undergraduate Advisory Committee.

Historically, Prime Day has been a chance for Amazon to heavily promote its own products, like its Alexa-enabled devices. Those gadgets usually make the retailer\u2019s list of Prime Day bestsellers each year. But for the past few years, Amazon has invested more heavily in spotlighting marketplace sellers in their deals. And it\u2019s paying off for third-party merchants participating in the sale. For the past several years, a Digital Commerce 360 analysis shows the share of marketplace sales is growing on Prime Day. Third-party merchants\u2019 sales accounted for 37.2% of all Prime Day sales through Amazon in 2022, up from 36.0% in 2021 and 35.1% in 2020.  Amazon Prime Day 2023 will be Tuesday, July 11, and Wednesday, July 12. We\u2019ll update this page regularly with updates. A second Prime Day event will likely fall in October. Dates for Amazon Prime Day in the past: Up until 2022, Amazon Prime Day was once a year in the summer. In 2022, the retail giant added another Prime Day event in October.","Jaccard Noise_20":0.4,"Cosine Noise_20":0.7623080015,"EM Noise_20":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":1,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"July 11","Noise_40 Document Index":"6","Noise_40 Document":"By Madison Flager and Meaghan Kenny All products featured on Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveler are independently selected by our editors.

Like previous years, 2023 Prime Day took place over a two-day span, Tuesday, July 11 and Wednesday, July 12. Amazon Prime Day dates for 2024 have not yet been announced. According to Amazon, the event originally started as a summer savings event to celebrate Amazon's birthday, which launched in July 2015. Due to the pandemic, the retailer pushed Prime Day 2020 to October and then moved back to the summer months with Prime Day 2021 and Prime Day 2022 falling in June and July. However, in October 2022, the retailer introduced a second two-day sale event that year: \"Prime Early Access Sale.\" This gave Amazon Prime members another chance to score savings ahead of the Black Friday and Cyber Monday shopping weekend.

{"Query":"Who was the MVP of Super Bowl 2022?","Correct Answer":["Cooper Kupp"],"Noise_0 Predicted Answer":"Kupp","Noise_0 Document Index":"7","Noise_0 Document":"So it was that Kupp hauled in the game-winning 1-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Matthew Stafford with 1:25 left and became the eighth wide receiver to win Super Bowl MVP -- and the first since Julian Edelman in Super Bowl LIII. Kupp, who was 7-1 to win MVP at Caesars Sportsbook, finished with eight catches for 92 yards and two scores. The second touchdown capped a drive in which Kupp, with the help of Stafford and some savvy tweaks from Rams coach Sean McVay, took over the game. After a quick start, Kupp, who also won the NFL's receiving triple crown by leading the league in receptions, yards and receiving touchdowns, didn't get the ball much. Fellow wideout Odell Beckham Jr. suffered a left knee injury with 3:50 remaining in the first half, and with Beckham out of the game, the Bengals threw everything they had at slowing Kupp.  \"Whatever it is, I just want to execute my job to the best of my ability,\" Kupp said. \"I trust that as the game goes on, I will have opportunities, as well, and I just want to stay ready for those things, stay locked in.\" In their first season as teammates, Matthew Stafford and Cooper Kupp connected for 22 TDs, including the playoffs. It was the second most by a QB-receiver duo in a season in NFL history.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.5,"Cosine Noise_0":0.6573181152,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":0,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Cooper Kupp","Noise_20 Document Index":"1","Noise_20 Document":"Feb 13, 2022 ...

Tom Brady is the only player to have won five Super Bowl MVP awards (four with the New England Patriots and one with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers); Joe Montana won three and four  other players\u2014Bart Starr, Terry Bradshaw, Eli Manning, and Patrick Mahomes\u2014have won the award twice.[8] Starr and Bradshaw are the only ones to have won it in back-to-back years. The MVP has come from the winning team every year except 1971, when Dallas Cowboys linebacker Chuck Howley won the award despite the Cowboys' loss in Super Bowl V to the Baltimore Colts.[9] Harvey Martin and Randy White were named co-MVPs of Super Bowl XII, the only time co-MVPs have been chosen.[10][11] Including the Super Bowl XII co-MVPs, seven Cowboys players have won Super Bowl MVP awards, the most of any NFL team. Quarterbacks have earned the honor 32 times in 57 games (and 58 awards).[12]  From Super Bowl I to Super Bowl XLIX the Super Bowl MVP won a new car from General Motors as a part of their MVP award. However since Hyundai became the official vehicle partner of the NFL from the 2015 NFL season onward no new car has been awarded to the Super Bowl MVP since Super Bowl 50.[13]","Jaccard Noise_60":0.0,"Cosine Noise_60":0.3463293016,"EM Noise_60":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_60":0,"Noise_80 Predicted Answer":"Mahomes","Noise_80 Document Index":"0","Noise_80 Document":"\"It hasn't even sunk in,\" Mahomes said after completing 21 of 27 passes for 182 yards and three touchdowns and winning Super Bowl MVP honors for the second time. \"I appreciate it because of the failure of losing the Super Bowl (in the 2020 campaign) and the AFC Championship Game (last season). It gives you greater appreciation for being a champion.\" Mahomes acknowledged that there was a huge difference between his reaction to winning this title and his first championship, a victory over San Francisco in Super Bowl LIV. Mahomes compared that first accomplishment to a wide-eyed kid taking home a prize from the fair. There was a whirlwind of success, accompanied by an offseason of celebrating and an attempt at a repeat that ended with that blowout loss to Tampa Bay in Super Bowl LV. Then came an overtime loss to Cincinnati in last year's AFC Championship Game, a defeat that had plenty to do with Mahomes playing his worst half of football in a second-half meltdown against the Bengals. Mahomes grew from all those moments in ways that weren't that visible when this regular season began. There was so much attention paid to the trade that sent Hill to Miami and all the blockbuster personnel moves made by the rest of the AFC West that it seemed as if the Chiefs were more vulnerable than ever. That was the first mistake made by all the doubters. They couldn't see that Mahomes is usually at his best when others are predicting his downfall.","Jaccard Noise_80":0.0,"Cosine Noise_80":0.2909983993,"EM Noise_80":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":0,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"Jerry Rice","Noise_100 Document Index":"5","Noise_100 Document":"Some of Kupp's many achievements: Became only the second player to win the receiving triple crown, NFL Offensive Player of the Year and Super Bowl MVP, joining Jerry Rice. A notable difference: Rice accomplished all of those things in a whole career, while Kupp did it in one season.  Set a record for receptions (33) and tied for the second-most receiving yards (478) and receiving touchdowns (6) in a postseason in NFL history. Caught a touchdown in each of the Rams' four postseason games, making him the second player in league history to do that in a single postseason, along with former Arizona Cardinals wideout Larry Fitzgerald. Joined former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Joe Montana as the only players to win Offensive Player of the Year and Super Bowl MVP in the same season. Became the first player to lead the league in receiving and win a Super Bowl since Rice in 1994. When it was over and his vision had become reality, Kupp struggled to find words on the podium. Even as he sat with his son and had more time to reflect, he was still overcome by the emotions of his own manifestation.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.2939629257,"EM Noise_100":0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}
