What microchip shortage? EV maker Tesla, which it should be pointed out produces its own chips in-house, seems not to have been bothered by supply-chain issues all that much in 2021, delivering 936,172 vehicles in the year just ended, according to a report by finance news outlet Finbold. That represents a healthy 87 percent increase over 2020, when the company handed over 499,550 Teslas to customers. Even better for the company, it ended the year with a bang, racking up a record number of sales in the last quarter of 2021, or 308,600 units. Most of that total consisted of Model 3 and Model Y models, no surprise. It\u2019s the sixth consecutive quarter that it breaks its record for sales. In 2019, the automaker delivered 367,500 units, so annual sales growth, while not exponential, is clearly accelerating. The company has said in the past that one its main goals is to attain 50 percent sales growth year after year. Once upon a time, Tesla struggled mightily to hit its delivery targets, but no more. There\u2019s also no sign of that growth slowing down any time soon, even as all-electric rivals join the market by the month. Projections made by Finbold put estimated sales for 2022 at over 1.5 million units, for an increase of close to 65 percent.

As revealed by SteamDB, Lost Ark passed Counter-Strike: Global Offensive's all-time peak of 1,308,963 players to secure the #2 spot. Considering these all-time peaks tend to happen around a game's release, it may be quite an uphill battle to take down PUBG's record of 3,257,248 players at one time. That aside, it's an impressive feat for the MMO that is developed by Smilegate and Tripod Studio and published by Amazon Game Studios. This accomplishment shouldn't come as too much of a surprise as Lost Ark had already become one of Steam's biggest-ever games before it even went free-to-play.

Amazon\u2019s recently-published online game Lost Ark has broken several playtime records on the Steam digital storefront. Lost Ark, developed by Smilegate RPG, is a massively-multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) that originally launched in South Korea in late 2019. Players enter the world of Arkesia as young warriors, mages, martial artists, and magic-users, who\u2019ve been chosen by prophecy to search for artifacts capable of saving the world from an awakening force of chaos. Upon its launch on Feb. 11, Lost Ark rapidly climbed Steam\u2019s charts to hit an all-time peak of 1,325,305 players on Feb. 12, as shown by independent trackers like SteamDB. This is the second-highest number for concurrent players ever tracked on Steam, behind the record of 3.26 million that was set in 2018 by PlayerUnknown\u2019s Battlegrounds, and the highest number period for any MMORPG on Steam. This also made Lost Ark the highest-played game on Steam in the 24 hours following its debut.

What\u2019s more, it also features a powerful cast, led by Gillian Anderson in one of her best roles. As compelling as Anderson is, she is matched by Jamie Dornan as the serial killer, who\u00a0exudes his familiar charm and charisma.

Russia's President Vladimir Putin has given varying public explanations for why he launched the invasion. Here are the reasons Putin gave, how they match with reality, and the other likely reasons why Russia sent its armed forces into an independent, sovereign nation. Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union, before declaring itself an independent country, cementing the move in a referendum days before the USSR collapsed in December 1991. The country has maintained its independence ever since. But Putin still refers to Ukraine as Russian, and denies it's a nation in its own right. He told then-US President George W. Bush in 2008 that Ukraine wasn't even a country. Stephen Hall, a Russian politics expert at the University of Bath in the UK, said many Russians still hold this view, and that \"it isn't just the Kremlin.\" Hall said Russia sees Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, as the \"mother of Russian cities,\" and for Putin he can't have that being outside his own country. Hall added that Russia needs to claim Ukraine in order to back up its argument to being a great power that has existed for millennia. Without it \"Russia can't claim a thousand years of history because Kyiv was already in existence 1,200 years ago, when Moscow was a forest,\" he said.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.6666666667,"Cosine Noise_0":0.8160431981,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Thursday","Noise_20 Document Index":"5","Noise_20 Document":"Russia launched an invasion of Ukraine on Thursday, sending troops into the ex-Soviet nation from three fronts and firing missiles on several locations near the capital, Kyiv, in a broad attack that has drawn deep condemnation from world leaders.

Russian troops quickly reach Kyiv\u2019s outskirts, but their attempts to capture the capital and other cities in the northeast meet stiff resistance. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy records a video outside his headquarters to show he is staying and remains in charge.","Jaccard Noise_60":1.0,"Cosine Noise_60":0.9552589655,"EM Noise_60":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_60":1,"Noise_80 Predicted Answer":"February 24, 2022","Noise_80 Document Index":"6","Noise_80 Document":"Jump to        Russia surprised the world on February 24, 2022, by invading Ukraine, starting a brutal battle that is still raging today. Russia's President Vladimir Putin has given varying public explanations for why he launched the invasion. Here are the reasons Putin gave, how they match with reality, and the other likely reasons why Russia sent its armed forces into an independent, sovereign nation. Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union, before declaring itself an independent country, cementing the move in a referendum days before the USSR collapsed in December 1991. The country has maintained its independence ever since. But Putin still refers to Ukraine as Russian, and denies it's a nation in its own right. He told then-US President George W. Bush in 2008 that Ukraine wasn't even a country. Stephen Hall, a Russian politics expert at the University of Bath in the UK, said many Russians still hold this view, and that \"it isn't just the Kremlin.\" Hall said Russia sees Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, as the \"mother of Russian cities,\" and for Putin he can't have that being outside his own country. Hall added that Russia needs to claim Ukraine in order to back up its argument to being a great power that has existed for millennia. Without it \"Russia can't claim a thousand years of history because Kyiv was already in existence 1,200 years ago, when Moscow was a forest,\" he said.","Jaccard Noise_80":0.6666666667,"Cosine Noise_80":0.8160431981,"EM Noise_80":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":1,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"April 2014","Noise_100 Document Index":"2","Noise_100 Document":"In March, Russia organised a controversial referendum and annexed Crimea. This was followed by the outbreak of the war in Donbas, which began in April 2014 when armed Russia-backed separatists seized Ukrainian government buildings, proclaiming the independent Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic.[31][32] Russian troops were involved in the conflict.[33][34][35] The Minsk agreements signed in September 2014 and February 2015 were a bid to stop the fighting, but ceasefires repeatedly failed.[36] A dispute emerged over the role of Russia: Normandy Format members France, Germany, and Ukraine saw Minsk as an agreement between Russia and Ukraine, whereas Russia insisted Ukraine should negotiate directly with the two separatist republics.[37][38] In 2021, Putin refused offers from Zelenskyy to hold high-level talks, and the Russian government endorsed an article by former president Dmitry Medvedev arguing that it was pointless to deal with Ukraine while it remained a \"vassal\" of the United States.[39]  The annexation of Crimea led to a new wave of Russian nationalism, with much of the Russian neo-imperial movement aspiring to annex more Ukrainian land to create Novorossiya (New Russia).[40] Analyst Vladimir Socor argued that Putin's 2014 speech after the annexation was a \"manifesto of Greater-Russia Irredentism\".","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.614918232,"EM Noise_100":0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

{"Query":"What chip does the iPhone 14 have?","Correct Answer":["A15"],"Noise_0 Predicted Answer":"A16 Bionic chip","Noise_0 Document Index":"4","Noise_0 Document":"Earlier this week, Qualcomm announced its latest Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 mobile chip and platform, promising to \"revolutionize flagship smartphones\" with \"groundbreaking\" experiences. The new chip is expected to launch in flagship Android smartphones later this year, but benchmarks suggest it cannot compete with Apple's A16 Bionic chip, which powers iPhone 14 Pro models. While the latest chip won't officially ship in smartphones for a few months, Geekbench scores for the chip have already been spotted in an unreleased Android handset. According to the results (via DealNTech), the latest Snapdragon 8 chip scored 1483 in single-core and 4709 in multi-core. The A16 Bionic scored 1874 in single-core and 5372 in multi-core. For comparison, the A15 Bionic chip, found in the iPhone 13 Pro and the lower-end iPhone 14 models, also scored higher than Qualcomm's latest chip with 1709 in single-core compared to 1483. In a press release for the new chip, Qualcomm said it will \"define a new standard for connected computing, intelligently engineered with groundbreaking AI across the board to enable extraordinary experiences.\" Qualcomm's senior vice president and general manager of mobile handsets, Chris Patrick, said, \"Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 will revolutionize the landscape of flagship smartphones in 2023.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.5923784971,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":0,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"A16 processor","Noise_20 Document Index":"2","Noise_20 Document":"By  Mitchell Clark Apple has announced that the regular iPhone won\u2019t be getting a new processor this year \u2014 instead, the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus will be powered by Apple\u2019s A15 Bionic chip, the same chip that\u2019s in the iPhone 13 Pro \u2014 though it does have a bit more grunt than the A15 that was in the regular iPhone 13 and the $429 iPhone SE from earlier this year, thanks to an extra GPU core. This is the first time that Apple\u2019s not updating to a new processor for one of its flagship iPhones since the 2008 iPhone 3G, which featured virtually the same internals as the original iPhone. The iPhone 14 Pro, meanwhile, has an A16 processor, which the company says is more power efficient, even when doing intensive tasks. The raw specs of the new chip are similar, though \u2014 like the A15 in the regular 14, it has a six-core CPU, a five-core GPU, and a 16-core Neural Engine. The new version just has better cores, according to Apple.  The decision not to update the chipset for the standard iPhone 14 isn\u2019t exactly a surprising one. Analysts like Ming-Chi Kuo and reporters like Mark Gurman have been predicting the move for months, and the chip shortage isn\u2019t quite over yet.

And while elementary education is hardly a war zone, younger students likely don\u2019t treat their devices with as much care as adults. Microsoft talked with school administrators, teachers and IT professionals working with students ranging in age from kindergarten to eighth grade. It quickly became apparent that three key items \u2014 the screen, keyboard and battery \u2014 were the most commonly damaged or broken components on classroom laptops, especially in devices that also went home with students. Those three components made up 85 percent of all repair orders, and the repair process itself was also a detriment to education. Normally, broken units must be shipped to a factory or repair center that might take a week or longer to ship the device back \u2014 meaning broken laptops were not available to students for extended periods. The shipping costs also were often the responsibility of the school.

She originally enrolled at Temple University to improve her singing skills, but eventually switched to musical theater. Once she finished her studies, she enrolled at the Yale School of Drama, graduating in 2011. Randolph has showcased her singing talent in a number of productions, mostly plays. She was even nominated for a Tony Award for her performance in the 2012 Broadway production of Ghost: The Musical.

Here\u2019s how it works. The M2 chip is here, ushering in the second generation of Apple's bespoke silicon The Apple M2 chip was unveiled at Apple's WWDC 2022 keynote on June 6, and it's the inaugural chip in Apple's second generation of bespoke silicon. This is significant because the M2 is an evolution of the remarkable M1 chip that debuted in 2020, and it powers Apple's new 13-inch MacBook Air 2022 and MacBook Pro 2022. These are successors to two of the best MacBooks on the market, so it's exciting to see what an M2 injection can do. The new Apple M2 chip debuted in two new laptops: the 13-inch MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, which launched in the Summer of 2022. The M2 chip is available in either the 13-inch MacBook Air 2022 (starting price: $1,199) or the MacBook Pro 2022 ($1,299), so you'll need to pay over $1k to get yourself an M2-powered MacBook.  It's also available in the Mac mini M2, a cheaper and more powerful version of Apple's pint-sized Mac. Apple's new M2 chip is configurable with an 8-core CPU and up to a 10-core GPU.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":1.0,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"June 6, 2022","Noise_20 Document Index":"3","Noise_20 Document":"Apple M2 is a series of ARM-based system on a chip (SoC) designed by Apple Inc. as a central processing unit (CPU) and graphics processing unit (GPU) for its Mac desktops and notebooks, and the iPad Pro tablet. It is the second generation of ARM architecture intended for Apple's Mac computers after switching from Intel Core to Apple silicon, succeeding the M1. Apple announced the M2 on June 6, 2022, at WWDC, along with models of the MacBook Air and the 13-inch MacBook Pro using the M2. The M2 is made with TSMC's \"Enhanced 5-nanometer technology\" N5P process and contains 20 billion transistors, a 25% increase from the M1. Apple claims CPU improvements up to 18% and GPU improvements up to 35% compared to the M1.[3]  The M2 was followed by the professional-focused M2 Pro and M2 Max chips in January 2023. The M2 Max is a higher-powered version of the M2 Pro, with more GPU cores and memory bandwidth, and a larger die size.[4] Apple introduced the M2 Ultra in June 2023, combining two M2 Max chips in one package.[1]","Jaccard Noise_20":0.6666666667,"Cosine Noise_20":0.836009264,"EM Noise_20":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":1,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"June 2022","Noise_40 Document Index":"3","Noise_40 Document":"Apple in June 2022 unveiled the M2, its next-generation Apple silicon chip that followed the M1 chip. This guide highlights everything you need to know about the M2 chip, from performance improvements to extra features.    The M2 is Apple's next-generation System on a Chip (SoC) developed for use in Macs and iPads. It marks Apple's continued work to transition away from the Intel chips that were used in Macs up until 2020. As a \"System on a Chip,\" the M2 integrates several different components, including the CPU, GPU, unified memory architecture (RAM), Neural Engine, Secure Enclave, SSD controller, image signal processor, encode\/decode engines, Thunderbolt controller with USB 4 support, and more, all of which power the different features in the Mac. Before Apple silicon, Macs used multiple chips for CPU, I\/O, and security, but Apple's effort to integrate these chips is the reason why the M2 is much faster and more efficient than Intel chips. The unified memory architecture that Apple has included is also a major factor because all of the technologies in the M2 are able to access the same data without having to swap between multiple pools of memory. Built into the M2 chip, the unified memory architecture means the CPU, GPU, and other processor components don't need to copy data between one another, and are able to access the same data pool.","Jaccard Noise_40":0.3333333333,"Cosine Noise_40":0.7838338614,"EM Noise_40":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":0,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"June 2022","Noise_60 Document Index":"3","Noise_60 Document":"When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission.

Update July 18: There could be an M3 iMac by the end 2023.

In a newsletter, Gurman indicated that Apple will launch an M3 iMac, as well as an M3 MacBook Pro and MacBook Air in the fall of 2023. The unveiling would happen at a second Apple event in October, following the release of the iPhone 15 in September.  Apple introduced new pricing for iMac in 2021, with the entry-level model costing $1,299. If Apple was to keep on an M1 iMac it could sell an iMac for less than $1,000. If it does that the starting price of the M3-powered range could actually increase, although, unless there\u2019s a significant redesign like the MacBook Air\u2013which isn\u2019t anticipated\u2013we expect the next model to cost the same. When Apple added the M2 Pro and M2 Max processors to MacBook Pro and Mac mini in January 2023, it also bumped pricing for the existing iMacs in countries outside the U.S. For example, in the U.K., each iMac model now costs \u00a3150 more even though it hasn\u2019t been updated.\u00a0 Since Apple has adjusted prices in line with exchange rate fluctuations we don\u2019t expect the pricing to increase again.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.5499382019,"EM Noise_100":0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

Commentators noted the clash with the Christian Christmas season was likely to cause disruption, whilst there was concern about how short the tournament was intended to be.[375] FIFA executive committee member Theo Zwanziger said that awarding the 2022 World Cup to Qatar was a \"blatant mistake\".[376]  Frank Lowy, chairman of Football Federation Australia, said that if the 2022 World Cup were moved to November and thus upset the schedule of the A-League, they would seek compensation from FIFA.[377] Richard Scudamore, chief executive of the Premier League, stated that they would consider legal action against FIFA because a move would interfere with the Premier League's popular Christmas and New Year fixture programme.[378] On 19 March 2015, FIFA sources confirmed that the final would be played on 18 December.[379]","Jaccard Noise_40":1.0,"Cosine Noise_40":0.9951483607,"EM Noise_40":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":1,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"18 December","Noise_60 Document Index":"2","Noise_60 Document":"244] Morocco earned 4th place, a record for the team and the best World Cup finish of any African or Arab nation.[245]  The final was played on 18 December between Argentina and France.

A few minutes later, France were awarded a penalty as Randal Kolo Muani was brought down in the penalty area by Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi.

Overcoming a history of buckling under the pressure of late-round Grand Slam tennis, Sabalenka, the powerful 24-year-old from Belarus, came from behind to beat Elena Rybakina of Kazakhstan 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 in the women\u2019s singles final of the Australian Open on Saturday. In a matchup of two of the biggest hitters in the sport, Sabalenka was a little more fearless and a few clicks more clinical than Rybakina in the crucial moments to cap off a dominant summer of tennis in Australia. It was Sabalenka\u2019s first Grand Slam title in a rocky career that has included the kind of error-ridden, big-moment meltdowns from which some players almost never recover. Instead, the match proved a microcosm of Sabalenka\u2019s career \u2014 a shaky start, filled with ill-timed double faults followed by a steadying midmatch recovery before a final-set display of raw power and precision that her opponent could not answer.

Still, the result was more decisive than the final polling averages that suggested Macron would win by a margin of 10 to 12 percentage points. The difference may be partly explained by late-deciding voters. Macron\u2019s polling lead had been increasing in the days before the runoff, and France\u2019s ban on publishing new polls after Friday night would have prevented fully capturing that surge. \u201cThe result is very disappointing for [Le Pen],\u201d said Vincent Martigny, a political scientist at the University of Nice. \u201cShe ended up very far from power.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.5,"Cosine Noise_100":0.8041411638,"EM Noise_100":0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}
{"Query":"What is the megapixel in main camera on the iPhone 14 Pro?","Correct Answer":["48"],"Noise_0 Predicted Answer":"48","Noise_0 Document Index":"9","Noise_0 Document":"I ended up with hundreds of photos and dozens of video clips on the 1TB iPhone 14 Pro review sample that Apple had lent me. The iPhone 14 Pro has three rear cameras: a main wide-angle camera, an ultrawide and a telephoto camera with 3x optical zoom. The lens on the main camera has a wider focal length, going from a 26mm equivalent on previous iPhone models to a 24mm one. It isn't drastically different, but it helps get more of the scene into the frame.   Just a cat under mixed lighting, as captured by the iPhone 14 Pro. The main camera also gets a new,\u00a0larger, 48-megapixel sensor. Though more megapixels doesn't necessarily mean better photos, Apple divides the pixels into groups of four and combines the four in each group into one larger pixel. This technique is called pixel binning, and it's been used on Android phones for years. The results are brighter photos that have less image noise (and as a bonus, less noise-reduction blur).\u00a0Apple's new imagining pipeline, called the Photonic Engine, takes things further and helps improve color accuracy and protect details.

We previously took a look at the technical readout of the iPhone 14 Pro, offering us a chance to look at the camera hardware changes. Our key takeaway was that there are indeed some major changes, even if just on paper. The rear camera bump is almost all-new: the iPhone 14 Pro gains larger sensors in its ultra-wide and main (wide) cameras, but Apple also promises leaps in image quality through improved software processing and special silicon. However, what caught everyone\u2019s eye first was the opener of Apple\u2019s presentation of iPhone 14 Pro: a striking visual change. The iPhone\u2019s recognizable screen cutout or \u2018notch\u2019 had all but disappeared, tucking its camera and sensor hardware into a small yet dynamic \u2018island\u2019. The user interface adapts around it; growing and shrinking with the screen cutout in an absolute feat of design. What\u2019s more impressive to us, however, was miniaturizing the complex and large array of sensors and camera needed for Face ID.

While we can dedicate an entire post to the details of camera sensors, allow me to briefly explain the benefits. Apple has a few main desires when it comes to its camera. Resolution was not the only reason to move to a more advanced, larger and higher pixel-count sensor. Apple desires speed, low noise, light gathering ability, dynamic range (that is, detail in both shadow and light areas) and many more things from this sensor.  As we mentioned before, algorithms are required to \u2018de-mosaic\u2019 this color information. In terms of sheer speed, a Quad Bayer sensor can quickly combine these four \u2018super subpixels\u2019 of single color into one, creating a regular 12 megapixel image.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.692504406,"EM Noise_100":0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

It would cost Apple a fortune to ship 79 pounds of equipment to individual homes all over the country, even with corporate discounts.

Yet Apple offers free shipping both directions with your $49 rental, plus a dedicated support team to validate your parts and facilitate returns.

Party members also have the ability to change their character class, granting them access to different abilities; raising a Hero's affinity with the party will unlock their class for use.

Horses and chimpanzees are now often placed on opposite sides of a perceived line between accepted and unacceptable animal use. Most horses are domesticated and have worked for humans for thousands of years. Their careers, reproduction and social lives are largely controlled by humans. In contrast, although individual chimpanzees have been held captive, their species remains wild.","Jaccard Noise_40":0.0,"Cosine Noise_40":0.3791771531,"EM Noise_40":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":0,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"Annie G","Noise_60 Document Index":"6","Noise_60 Document":"Reporters at the time called the feat a \u201cgreat success\u201d and debated over who deserved more credit\u2014Muybridge for devising the setup or Stanford for financing it.

The field constructed for the movie, which has been operated as a tourist destination since 1989, could not be brought to MLB game standards without permanently altering major features of the property and destroying its movie authenticity, so it was decided to build a separate playing facility at a distance of approximately 500\u00a0ft (150\u00a0m) in the cornfields. The new field is in the property of the Ameskamp family, who used to own the left and center field of the 1988 Field of Dreams (the rest was owned by the Lansing family) before selling it to the Lansing family in 2007.

Is it worth $15,000? For years now, Musk has stated that Tesla would keep gradually increasing the price of its Full Self-Driving (FSD) package as functionality improves leading to the actual final form of the product, which is, as its name suggests, the capacity to fully drive autonomously.  However, the feature hasn\u2019t lived up to its name so far. It has been in beta for two years now, and it is still far from self-driving. Technically, the system is able to both activate and attempt to drive in most areas, including across intersections, but the responsibility remains with the driver, who needs to be paying attention at all times and be ready to take control. Many see the willingness to take responsibility for the system as the most important step companies developing self-driving systems can take toward achieving this goal. Tesla has made it clear that it is not there yet and participating in the FSD Beta comes with a bunch of warnings that make it clear the responsibility is still with the driver. But Tesla sees every new FSD update as a step closer to the goal, and it believes that some of those updates even warrant price increases for the package.

Williams edged finalists Max Duggan of TCU, C.J. Stroud of Ohio State and Stetson Bennett IV of Georgia -- all quarterbacks -- to become the Trojans' first Heisman winner since running back Reggie Bush, who was later forced to vacate his 2005 award. Williams passed for 4,075 yards, 37 touchdowns and just four interceptions while completing 66.1% of his passes this season. He guided USC to an 11-2 record and appearance in the Pac-12 Championship Game where he played through injuries in a loss to Utah. His victory gives USC eight Heismans, most among any program in the nation. However, given the Heisman Trust and NCAA no longer recognize Bush as having won the trophy in 2005, USC will be listed with seven Heismans, tying it for most all-time with Notre Dame, Ohio State and Oklahoma.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.9999999404,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Caleb Williams","Noise_20 Document Index":"2","Noise_20 Document":"Dec 11, 2022 ...

Born and raised in Memphis, Henry  is no stranger to the ever-changing weather of the Mid-South having experienced everything from Ice Storm 94 to the Super Tuesday tornado outbreak in February 2008. Believe it or not, Henry was terrified of thunderstorms until he was seven years old.  That's when his cousin took him outside during a storm (highly advise against that now) and explained to him what was causing all of the scary noise.  It was from that point that his fear became a fascination and now a career! While a junior in high school in Memphis, Henry began shadowing the weather team at CBS affiliate WREG-TV.  He mainly spent his time shadowing Todd Demers on the morning newscast.  He arrived at the station at 4:30 a.m. when his school schedule would allow and spent as much time at WREG as time allowed.  Henry credits this experience with jump starting his career. Henry attended the University of Missouri where he was a member of the Mizzou Storm Chase Team, chasing storms all across the plain states.

Mandatory Credit: Kayla Wolf-USA TODAY Sports It\u2019s a different situation for the Oklahoma football opponent this Saturday. After the firing of Scott Frost, Mickey Joseph will step into Nebraska\u2019s interim head coach role. Joseph played quarterback at Nebraska and got the reigns to the offense in 1991. Joseph led the Cornhuskers to an 8-0 start in the 1991 season but fell to Colorado a week later. The Sooners faced the Cornhuskers in Norman for the season finale, which was a devastating event for Joseph. The signal caller broke his leg early in the first quarter, ending his junior season.

The CFP has featured a four-team field since it first debuted in the 2014 season. But the playoff is soon going to triple in size, as 12 teams will battle it out for the national championship. So, with more games across more rounds, what is the schedule for the expanded CFP going to look like? And how exactly will the new format work? With the schedule set for the first two 12-team CFPs, here's what to know: The playoff will expand to 12 teams beginning with the 2024 season. So the upcoming 2023 campaign will still feature a four-team CFP field. Under the new format, the six highest-ranked conference champions will receive automatic bids. The field will then be filled out with the six highest-ranked teams remaining. The four highest-ranked conference champions receive a first-round bye to the quarterfinals. In the first round, the matchups are No. 5 vs. No. 12, No. 6 vs. No. 11, No. 7 vs. No. 10, and No. 8 vs. No. 9. The first-round games are not played at neutral sites, with the lower seed having home-field advantage instead.

Just like before, the new model increases the screen size of the standard one, but keeps the majority of the other technical features in place. It fits in that awkward space between the cheaper iPhone 14 and the slightly more expensive, but superior Pro model. But is there any real reason to buy it? The iPhone 14 Plus is wider, taller, and heavier than the iPhone 14, and the only dimension that stays the same is the thickness at 7.8mm. Made from aluminum and glass, it\u2019s a step down in luxury from the stainless steel and glass Pro models, but with this comes the advantage of low weight. At 203 grams, the iPhone 14 Plus can\u2019t be called light, but it\u2019s lighter than the iPhone 14 Pro and only a few grams heavier than the Samsung Galaxy S22+. My usual iPhone of choice is the iPhone 14 Pro, and I\u2019ve been consistently surprised at how light the iPhone 14 Plus feels when I pick it up, despite the larger screen and body, as well as the scant 3-gram real-world difference between them.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.3333333333,"Cosine Noise_100":0.781891644,"EM Noise_100":0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

This is the winsome yet disturbing journey at the center of Susie Searches.\u00a0 Kiersey Clemons stars as Susie Wallis, a socially awkward college student with a mind for solving mysteries. Naturally, she has her own true crime podcast called Susie Searches, so when fellow student\/meditation influencer Jesse (Alex Wolff) goes missing, her interest in cracking the case isn't exactly selfless. If she finds the internet-adored victim, she and her podcast could score the validation she desperately craves.

Points are awarded based on how far a player advances in tournaments and the category of those tournaments. The ATP has used a computerized system for determining the rankings since August 23, 1973.[2] Starting in 1979, an updated rankings list is released at the beginning of each week.

Since the introduction of the rankings, the method used to calculate a player's ranking points has changed several times. As of 2019, the rankings are calculated by totaling the points a player wins in his best eighteen tournaments, subject to certain restrictions. For top players the counting tournaments are the four Grand Slam tournaments, the eight mandatory ATP Masters tournaments, the non-mandatory ATP Masters 1000 event in Monte-Carlo, the player's best four eligible ATP Tour 500 tournaments and his best two results from ATP Tour 250 tournaments.","Jaccard Noise_80":1.0,"Cosine Noise_80":0.9999999404,"EM Noise_80":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":1,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"Andy Murray","Noise_100 Document Index":"5","Noise_100 Document":"Holger Rune Denmark 2,888 12.

Breath of the Wild is considered one of the greatest video games of all time. Journalists described it as a landmark in open-world design for its emphasis on experimentation, physics-based sandbox, and emergent gameplay. Numerous developers cited Breath of the Wild as inspiration, and it is a popular point of comparison among open-world games.

Breath of the Wild is an open world action-adventure game. Players are tasked with exploring the kingdom of Hyrule while controlling Link. Breath of the Wild encourages nonlinear gameplay, which is illustrated by the game's lack of defined entrances or exits to areas,[1] scant instruction given to the player, and encouragement to explore freely.[2] Breath of the Wild introduces a consistent physics engine to the Zelda series, letting players approach problems in different ways rather than trying to find a single solution.[3] The game also integrates a \"chemistry engine\" that defines the physical properties of most objects and governs how they interact with the player and one another.","Jaccard Noise_20":1.0,"Cosine Noise_20":1.0,"EM Noise_20":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":1,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom","Noise_40 Document Index":"1","Noise_40 Document":"By  Jay Peters, a news editor who writes about technology, video games, and virtual worlds.

For these papers, the authors may provide an author response but not revise their paper (with the exception of adding the required \u201climitations\u201d section, if it was missing from the ARR submission; see below). This year, some of the reviews, author responses and meta reviews will be made publicly available. Our motivation is to provide increased transparency in the review process, to foster more accountability for reviewers and higher quality reviews as well as enabling peer review research by providing an open collection of papers and reviews. We will follow a process where only reviews, author responses and meta reviews of accepted papers and opt-in rejected papers (where opting in is done by authors) will be made publicly available after the acceptance notifications. We will use the OpenReview platform, which is also currently used by the ACL Rolling Review as well as other related conferences and is well suited to this type of process.

Hard-right leader Giorgia Meloni was sworn in as Italy\u2019s first female prime minister amid looming questions over her coalition partners\u2019 stance towards Russia. The 45-year-old leader recited the ritual oath of office before Italian President Sergio Mattarella on Saturday after her party Brothers of Italy won more than 25 percent of the vote in snap elections in late September. She pledged to act \u201cin the exclusive interests of the nation\u201d \u2013 a promise then repeated by her 24 ministers, six of them women. The ceremony took place a day after Meloni along with her coalition partners \u2013 hardliner Matteo Salvini of the League party and Forza Italia\u2019s TV tycoon Silvio Berlusconi \u2013 unveiled their cabinet. The government is expected to face confidence votes in parliament next week. Forza Italia\u2019s Antonio Tajani is now the country\u2019s foreign minister. He has a long history with European institutions and was president of the European Parliament in 2017. The economy ministry will be in the hands of League\u2019s Giancarlo Giorgetti who is considered relatively pro-Europe, and one of the most moderate among party members.

After a week of infighting which overshadowed the negotiations, Meloni\u2019s warring coalition put forward a united front, backing Meloni to lead the country during formal talks with President Sergio Mattarella, on Friday. Later on Friday Mattarella asked Meloni to form a government.\u00a0 Meloni, after arriving for talks in a Fiat 500, accepted unconditionally, a spokesman for the president\u2019s office said. The right-wing coalition emerged triumphant from the election, with 44 percent of the vote, led by Meloni\u2019s Brothers of Italy party, which took 26 percent. But even before a government could be cobbled together, rivalry emerged inside the coalition, with allies arguing over Meloni\u2019s unwillingness to accommodate Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s preferred nominations in her cabinet.

Tetsuya Yamagami was arrested immediately after allegedly shooting Abe with a handmade gun as the former leader was making a campaign speech in July outside a train station in Nara in western Japan.  Later that month, Yamagami was sent to an Osaka detention center for a nearly six-month mental evaluation, which ended Tuesday. Yamagami is now back in police custody in Nara. Prosecutors said results of his mental evaluation showed he is fit to stand trial. Yamagami was also charged with violating a gun control law, according to the Nara District Court. Police have said Yamagami told them that he killed Abe, one of Japan\u2019s most influential and divisive politicians, because of Abe\u2019s apparent links to a religious group that he hated. In his statements and in social media postings attributed to him, Yamagami said he developed a grudge because his mother had made massive donations to the Unification Church that bankrupted his family and ruined his life. One of his lawyers, Masaaki Furukawa, told the Associated Press on Thursday that Yamagami was in good health during his mental evaluation in Osaka when he was only allowed to see his sister and three lawyers.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":1.0000001192,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Tetsuya Yamagami","Noise_20 Document Index":"3","Noise_20 Document":"Illustration of Japan\u2019s former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.

After receiving criticism, he published an apology video on YouTube.[283]  Several media outlets misidentified the video game developer Hideo Kojima as the assassin.[284][285][286] The misreporting allegedly stemmed from jokes on the online message board 4chan and Twitter that were taken as fact and subsequently published by the far-right French politician Damien Rieu\u00a0[fr],[287][288] the Greek news outlet ANT1, and the Iranian website Mashregh News.[284][289] ANT1 additionally reported that the suspect was \"passionate about Che Guevara\".[290] ANT1 uploaded the broadcast to its YouTube account, but later removed it.[291] Rieu took down the original tweet and issued an apology.","Jaccard Noise_60":0.5,"Cosine Noise_60":0.8389334679,"EM Noise_60":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_60":0,"Noise_80 Predicted Answer":"Yamagami","Noise_80 Document Index":"0","Noise_80 Document":"Aug 26, 2022 ...

Nobusuke Kishi, his maternal grandfather, was Prime Minister of Japan from 1957 to 1960, and like Abe, was the target of an assassination attempt.

Roads were closed around the Nippon Budokan Hall, where the event was held. Some 20,000 police were mobilized to prevent the sort of security lapses which allowed Abe's suspected killer to walk behind him at a July 8 campaign event and shoot him twice with a homemade shotgun.

The good news is that a third season has not only been confirmed but is very much on it's way. Here's everything we know, from expected release date to trailer and more. Good news,  Derry Girls fans. We finally have a release date for the third and final series. And it's soon! Mark it in your calendars and clear your diaries: The third and final series of #DerryGirls starts Tuesday 12th April. Channel 4 announced the news with another first look clip at the show, and oh it looks so good! One reply from a fan summed up our reaction nicely: \"Thank God we\u2019ve got a date!!!! Need to take a days annual leave!\" Yes! Finally! Our first look at the cast back in action for the third and final time dropped in mid-March 2022, and it's so nice to see them back to their usual mischief.

It's had a strong history of success in motorsports, correctly predicting seven winners during the 2021 NASCAR season and its projected leaderboards have forecasted winners across multiple racing formats. The model has been scorching hot when it comes to picking Formula 1 race events dating back to 2021. It nailed both of Leclerc's wins in 2022, and at the 2021 Mexican Grand Prix, the model was strongly backing Verstappen as its top pick. The result: Verstappen dominated the field and ran away with a surprise victory. The model followed that up by calling Verstappen's win at the Rolex Emilia Romagna GP in April and then nailed his wins again each of the last two weeks in Belgium and the Netherlands. Anyone who followed the model's lead on those plays has seen huge returns Now, the model has dialed in on the 2022 Formula 1 Japanese Grand Prix and just released its coveted picks and leaderboard projections.

Dwayne Johnson is poised to play Black Adam for the DCEU, a role he's been officially attached to since 2014.\u00a0Black Adam, which was recently rescheduled for July 2022, will mark his debut in the franchise.\u00a0Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra, the film will tell the supervillain-turned-anti-hero's origin story. Additionally, it will feature the big screen debut of the Justice Society of America; how exactly they will collide with Black Adam remains to be seen. Black Adam has been in the works for years, but it has suffered more than a few setbacks. A great deal of progress was made in 2020, but the coronavirus pandemic forced the start of filming to be delayed. Luckily, that period of waiting has finally come to an end, as\u00a0Black Adam began filming only days ago. Johnson confirmed the news on social media, along with his excitement at finally playing the DC character. He'll be joined by the likes of Pierce Brosnan (Dr. Fate), Aldis Hodge (Hawkman), and Shahi, whose role up until now has remained a mystery.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":1.0,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Sarah Shahi","Noise_20 Document Index":"3","Noise_20 Document":"Adrianna Tomaz   Real name Adrianna Tomaz   Alias(es) Nassan[1]Addy[2]   Species Human   Nationality  Kahndaqi   Gender Female   Title(s) Professor (formerly)   Affiliation(s) Kahndaqi University (formerly)   Status Alive    Appearances  Film(s) Black Adam   Comic(s) Black Adam - The Justice Society Files: HawkmanBlack Adam - The Justice Society Files: CycloneBlack Adam - The Justice Society Files: Atom SmasherBlack Adam - The Justice Society Files: Doctor Fate    Actor(s)  Portrayed by Sarah Shahi     Adrianna Tomaz is a former professor at Kahndaqi University and a freedom fighter who led the resistance in Kahndaq.

After weeks of discussion, during which Adrianna changed the way Adam looked at the world, Adam retrieved the magical amulet of Isis from the tomb of his wife and children, and asked Captain Marvel to confer its power on Adrianna. The Amulet of Isis had long ago belonged to another of the wizard Shazam's champions, Queen Pharoah Hatshepsut of the 15th Dynasty, who had used it to bring peace to her kingdom. Upon Hatshepsut's death the amulet became dormant.  Upon holding the amulet and speaking \"I am Isis\", Adrianna was transformed and instilled with the powers of the goddess. She and Adam then began traveling the Middle East and freeing enslaved children, hoping to find Isis' kidnapped brother. In Week Sixteen of the series, Adam proposes to Isis and the two are wed by Captain Marvel, with several other Marvel Family members (Mary Marvel, Captain Marvel Jr., Tawky Tawny the tiger and Uncle Dudley) present as members of the wedding party. It is suggested that the presence of Isis is having a calming influence on Black Adam, transforming him from the ruthless dictator he was prior to her arrival into a more benevolent figure.  Adrianna finally locates Amon, who has been tortured and crippled by Whisper A'Daire for refusing to join Intergang.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.2386903167,"EM Noise_100":0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

It made an overpriced GPU suddenly appear much more desirable than it ever should have been. Now, the question is, was this Nvidia\u2019s plan all along, or did it simply overestimate the enthusiasm people would have for the 4080? Considering the fact that Nvidia is planning to strategically cut the MSRP of the RTX 4080 soon, it might be that it never intended for the 4080 to serve as a crutch for the sales of the 4090. Nvidia also has some serious competition on the horizon.

With the upcoming price cut, the RTX 4080 might become a more worthwhile contender. For now, if you manage to spot the 4090 for $1,600, it is a better deal \u2014 but only if you can make use of it. If you\u2019re a casual gamer, save your money and get the 4080 without worrying about benchmarks and comparisons.

In the latest leadership contest, Mr Sunak racked up the support of his fellow MPs early, and fast. He crossed the 100 nominations he needed long before the deadline - including from MPs that had previously backed Truss or Boris Johnson. He clashed with the former PM during the previous leadership race, claiming her plan to borrow money during an inflation crisis was a \"fairytale\" that would plunge the economy into chaos. His parents came to the UK from east Africa and are both of Indian origin. Mr Sunak was born in Southampton in 1980, where his father was a GP and his mother ran a pharmacy. He went to the boarding school Winchester College, then studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Oxford, and business at Stanford in America. He is now the first British Asian prime minister. Mr Sunak was first elected as an MP in 2015 - for Richmond in north Yorkshire - but rose quickly, and was made finance minister - or chancellor - in February 2020 under Boris Johnson.

Not only is fan favorite David Tennant returning to the franchise for a series of specials, but Ncuti Gatwa has been cast as the Fifteenth Doctor, the first black actor to play the iconic hero. While little is known about the new Doctor, the BBC did announce that Millie Gibson has been cast as Ruby Sunday, the Doctor's new companion. Much attention has been paid to Tennant's return and Gatwa's casting, but Gibson is an exciting choice for the franchise. The companion is just as important for Doctor Who as the Doctor himself, so the person cast in the role takes on a big responsibility. At just 18 years old, she will be the youngest person to be cast as a companion and was only a one-year-old when the series was revived in 2005. Is the young star ready for such a major role? Her casting might be the key to understanding the new direction for the series. The Doctor's companion is an important role in the series, but this is a performance on a television series.

Would it be Ralph Lauren, the quintessential American designer, who invited Naomi to their Fall\/Winter 2022 fashion show? Would it be Valentino, who dressed Naomi for President Biden's inauguration night last year? Or perhaps Reem Acra, a favorite of her grandmother, First Lady Jill Biden, or maybe her former employer Tom Ford (she interned for the brand in college)? Now we know: Naomi Biden wore Ralph Lauren at her South Lawn wedding ceremony. She looked elegant in a long-sleeved gown, with a long veil and train. She kept her accessories simple, wearing a pair of Tiffany diamond and pearl drop earrings, and carried a bouquet of white flowers. Her wedding band was Tiffany as well\u2014as was Neal's band. He paired it with a Schlumberger single daisy brooch. First Lady Jill Biden's outfit kept to her classic style: she wore a teal wool crepe coat and a blue silk chiffon dress designed by Reem Acra.

It has been a while since the profilers' last on-screen case, but the characters' stories continued during that period. Granted that revival retcons the Criminal Minds finale in several ways, it's essentially the same thing. That being said, Paramount+ just cannot simply use the title Criminal Minds season 16 because the project is different in a couple of significant ways from its original run. That includes veering away from its episodic storytelling format to a more serialized one, not to mention being darker and more disturbing than CBS' iteration. By giving the Criminal Minds revival a new title, Paramount+ allows it to be both a reboot and a continuation of the CBS series. Calling it Criminal Minds season 16 could also be confusing if the project doesn\u2019t address every single plot line that the finale left loose, which puts a lot of burden on the new series. Having its official title of Criminal Minds: Evolution quickly establishes that the show is part of the Criminal Minds brand, which could entice some formers fans to check it out, especially those who haven\u2019t been keeping track of Paramount+\u2019s efforts to bring back the BAU on the small screen.

Fans didn\u2019t have to wait long for news of a revival, as the team couldn\u2019t stay away from a new series premiering this Fall on\u00a0Paramount+.

Hoffa, the general president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, said in a telephone interview with NBC News. \"The Republicans weren\u2019t going to do it. The Teamsters' Central States pension fund, covering nearly 400,000 workers and retirees, is the marquee beneficiary of pension provisions attached to the larger relief bill. But labor leaders say as many as 200 plans will be shored up, providing direct benefit to as many as 1.5 million people in the short term, and many more overall. \"That means the difference between eating and not eating, and having a good retirement and one where you\u2019re basically out there working trying to survive,\" Hoffa said. \"The No. 1 priority, we've solved it.\" This account of the Teamsters' drive to save retirement plans for millions of pensioners is drawn from interviews with several of the union's officials, congressional sources and the public record. It begins with one Hoffa, the late Teamsters chief James R. Hoffa, and the Central States pension fund he started.","Jaccard Noise_60":0.3333333333,"Cosine Noise_60":0.5008574724,"EM Noise_60":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_60":0,"Noise_80 Predicted Answer":"$36 billion","Noise_80 Document Index":"3","Noise_80 Document":"Biden prodded Congress to pass legislation forcing a settlement in a long-running dispute between rail companies and workers, heading off a strike that could have upended the economy just before the holidays. While the agreement included wage increases, schedule flexibility and an additional paid day off, several rail unions had rejected it because it lacked paid sick leave. A move to add seven days of paid sick leave failed in Congress before Mr. Biden signed the bill. The showdown over the rail settlement left Mr. Biden in the awkward position of forcing a deal over the objections of some union members even though he had promised to be the \u201cthe most pro-union president you\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d The pension rescue plan announced on Thursday put him back in the more comfortable stance of allying himself with organized labor, a key constituency of the Democratic Party. The $36 billion, drawn from the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan passed last year, will go to the Central States Pension Fund, which is largely made up of Teamster workers and retirees. The fund has been the largest financially distressed multi-employer pension plan in the nation. As a result of shortfalls, pensioners were facing 60 percent cuts over the next few years, but the White House said the federal funding will now ensure full benefits through 2051.","Jaccard Noise_80":1.0,"Cosine Noise_80":0.9140014648,"EM Noise_80":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":1,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"tens of billions of dollars","Noise_100 Document Index":"6","Noise_100 Document":"\"We have a defined challenge to our country that we should not be facing, because it's just not fair and it's just not right,\" Pelosi told the crowd, according to The Detroit News. Every time she saw Hoffa in recent years, she would greet him with the word \"pensions\" before he could get it out. When Democrats took control of the House in 2019, Pelosi moved the loan-program bill through the House. But it was dead on arrival in the Senate, where then-Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., opposed the costly fix. Then, when Democrats won power in the Senate in January on the strength of a pair of run-off election victories in Georgia, the dynamics of the pension issue changed dramatically. Instead of asking unions to address their pension liabilities through a loan program, Democrats saw an opportunity to inject tens of billions of dollars of relief into the multiemployer pensions to keep them solvent for the next few decades. Biden, who framed much of his campaign around rebuilding unions as a path to strengthening the middle class, was on board. Hoffa spoke to him repeatedly about the issue during the 2020 election cycle. \"He said 'I'll be there,'\" Hoffa said. \"He was very well aware of it.\" But Democrats hold very thin margins in the House and Senate.

{"Query":"Who is the new president of the NCAA?","Correct Answer":["Charlie Baker"],"Noise_0 Predicted Answer":"Baker","Noise_0 Document Index":"9","Noise_0 Document":"The NCAA had four major priorities in it search for a new president to look after college athletics. It wanted a former college athlete, an exec passionate about higher education, an established corporate leader and a savvy politician who knows how to get things done in government. The governing body found all of those traits and more in Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker, a former Harvard basketball athlete and avid sports fan. The NCAA announced today that it has selected the two-term governor to be its next president. Baker will replace outgoing NCAA President Mark Emmert starting March 1. His second term as governor is slated to conclude Jan. 5; he announced about a year ago that he wouldn\u2019t seek a third term. Emmert will stay on as an adviser through June. The NCAA\u2019s choice of Baker, 66, signifies the association\u2019s desire to have a leader who is well-versed in the ways that Washington, D.C., works. With the NCAA facing so many legal and legislative challenges, the board of governors, who made the hire, focused on someone from the political arena early in the process and Baker emerged as the candidate with the experience and expertise to navigate the governmental and athletic worlds that often collide in college sports. When asked why he wanted the job, Baker replied, \u201cBecause it\u2019s worth doing. Yeah, it\u2019s big and complicated, but so have been a lot of things in my life.\u201c Baker represents the first NCAA leader who doesn\u2019t have a background in college athletics or higher education.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.5,"Cosine Noise_0":0.8922551274,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":0,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Charlie Baker","Noise_20 Document Index":"5","Noise_20 Document":"Mar 14, 2023 ...

The inequities between the men and women were obvious and stark, which put the NCAA into damage-control mode. At that point, those in the women's basketball world had to question if Emmert was very sincere in his concern, but there was a \"better-late-than-never\" sentiment. And the NCAA's decision to commission the so-called Kaplan report, which did a deep dive into inequities in all men's and women's NCAA championships, was an important step because it didn't pull any punches about how significant those issues have been. The report also said the NCAA has been selling women's sports short regarding potential television revenue. When it's time to negotiate TV rights again, rather than selling multiple championships in a bargain bundle, the NCAA needs to think bigger about the worth of each championship and how best to maximize revenue from it. Also, the NCAA has to show more leadership regarding the inclusion of transgender athletes in competition. As with so many things, the NCAA has been behind on this.

When COVID-19 hit the Big East, the conference was fully insured against loss thanks to her leadership. Like all these candidates, she is qualified.

Or at least try to. As the rest of my colleagues have put it, this NCAA has done nearly everything in its power to look slow and incompetent the past few years. Their way of handling nearly every major issue college athletics has faced has been, at best, archaic, and at worst, willfully malicious.

The company has also faced criticism for its handling of the situation and the toxic work environment that allegedly exists within the company. This has resulted in significant public backlash, with some fans and employees calling for boycotts and protests. Alegre\u2019s departure from Activision to Yuga Labs may be seen as a positive move for those who are critical of Activision\u2019s leadership and culture. It\u2019s worth noting that the gaming industry and the NFT space have both been the subject of intense scrutiny and controversy in recent years. The allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination at Activision Blizzard have been a particularly significant source of controversy in the gaming industry. Meanwhile, the NFT space has faced criticism for its environmental impact and the high levels of speculation and price volatility surrounding some NFTs. Furthermore, the recent fake news surrounding Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) highlights the need for responsible and informed reporting in the NFT space. Given these issues, the appointment of Alegre as Yuga Labs\u2019 CEO marks an interesting new phase for the company. As Yuga Labs continues to expand its presence in the NFT gaming space, it will be important for the company to navigate these complex issues with transparency and responsibility.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.5,"Cosine Noise_100":0.8304985762,"EM Noise_100":0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

Big Screen History, Explained Billy Batson is played by Asher Angel while the superhero adult form of Shazam is played by Zachary Levi. The character wears his comic book character's signature red outfit with a white cape and lightning bolt on his chest. Shazam, originally named Captain Marvel, was at one point the most popular superhero in the world and even outsold Superman comics. The character has the potential to be a major part of the DCU; if the sequel does well, there's little doubt he can fit him into James Gunn and Peter Safran's new plans for the franchise. Freddy Freeman is Billy's physically disabled foster brother and also the first person to learn that Billy has superpowers. Freddy is an expert on all things superheroes and helps Billy learn more about his powers. Freddy Freeman's adult form, formerly known as Captain Marvel Jr. in the comics, wears a blue super suit and has a great deal of flight power, which is fitting because that was the superpower he told Billy he wished he could have. One of the most courageous members of the group (representing Achilles), his kid form is played by Jack Dylan Grazer, while his adult form is played by Adam Brody. A notable thing about Freddy Freeman is, while originally under the name Captain Marvel Jr., was the favorite superhero of rock icon Elvis Presley.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.2978718877,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":0,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Asher Angel","Noise_20 Document Index":"4","Noise_20 Document":"Now streaming on: \u201cShazam!

They sit around a New York apartment and talk about life, and sometimes the topics of conversation unexpectedly get deep, such as in this viewer-captured segment where they discussed the afterlife. Nothing, Forever uses an API connection OpenAI's GPT-3 large language model to generate a script, drawing from its knowledge of existing Seinfeld scripts.

(Microsoft won\u2019t say which version of OpenAI\u2019s software is running under Bing\u2019s hood, but it\u2019s rumored to be based on GPT-4, a yet-to-be released language model.) Microsoft, which first invested in OpenAI in 2019 and re-upped with a reported $10 billion investment this year, is capitalizing on a wave of recent progress in A.I. capabilities to try to catch up with Google, which has long held a dominant position in the search market. (And which has been spooked by all the recent ChatGPT hoopla into releasing new A.I. tools of its own.) Microsoft eventually plans to incorporate OpenAI\u2019s technology into many of its products. But the Bing relaunch is especially momentous for Microsoft, which has struggled to gain a foothold in search for years. If it works, it could chip away at Google\u2019s dominance and some of the more than $100 billion in annual search advertising revenue that comes with it.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.2609081566,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":0,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"AI","Noise_20 Document Index":"7","Noise_20 Document":"These will pop up when you search for facts that Bing knows the answer to.

Pikmin 4 is set to launch for the Nintendo Switch on July 21 and marks the newest numbered entry in the real-time strategy series in over ten years, making its release quite the big deal for hardcore fans. Instead of playing as Captain Olimar (who most people know from Super Smash Bros. at this point) or any of his space explorer comrades, gamers will get to customize their own character (a series first). There are not too many options available, but it's still a step forward in terms of a character creator in a Nintendo first-party title. Pikmin 4 comes out in a couple of days and retails for $59.99, the same price as most other major games on the Switch. People who decided to pre-order the game digitally via the Switch eShop are probably wondering just when they'll be able to actually boot the game and start playing --that's where this guide comes into play.

That second clip introduces some of the sequel\u2019s new features. Pikmin 4 will introduce a new ice Pikmin type that\u2019s capable of freezing water, giving all Pikmin safe passage. The biggest revelation, though, is that the game will feature an adorable dog-like companion that can aid Captain Olimar. In the trailer, we see it dragging an item back to Olimar\u2019s ship all by itself, seemingly confirming that it has the power of 10 Pikmin. Elsewhere, we see it barreling into obstacles to open up new parts of the world. That aspect is a major departure for the series and should make it stand apart from previous entries.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy Check out what's clicking on FoxBusiness.com. Amazon is drawing criticism for its plan to acquire Roomba maker iRobot for $1.7 billion in an effort to expand its footprint in the home devices and consumer robotics markets. Ron Knox, a senior researcher at the Institute for Local Self Reliance, has called on regulators to challenge the deal, calling it the \"most dangerous, threatening\" acquisition in the e-commerce behemoth's history. In a lengthy Twitter thread on Aug. 5, Knox argued that the deal would take Amazon's biggest rival out of the market and allow it to beat the remaining competition through predatory pricing. \"Jeff Bezos has said that Amazon wants to buy its way to dominance. By snatching up Roomba and pairing it with its vast monopoly power fueled by its Prime system, it would do just that,\" he said. \"There may be other smart vacuums today, but there won't be once Amazon owns Roomba.","Jaccard Noise_20":1.0,"Cosine Noise_20":1.0,"EM Noise_20":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":1,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"Amazon","Noise_40 Document Index":"0","Noise_40 Document":"Aug 5, 2022 ...

This year, that includes both hardware and software \u2014 and, as you might imagine, lots and lots of talk about AI. Here's everything you need to know. At I\/O, Google not only fully revealed its next midrange phone, the Pixel 7a, but also surprise-announced that the phone is available to purchase \u2014 not preorder \u2014 right now, for $499. The phone shares a lot of DNA with the $600 Pixel 7, including its Tensor G2 chipset, eight gigs of RAM, and design, which is nearly indistinguishable from its more expensive cousin. If you're interested to learn more, we've got a full review for you to check out. Interestingly, the Pixel 6a will remain on offer at a lower price point: $350. As anticipated, Google showed off its first foldable at I\/O this year.

Google Pixel Fold, which has a 7.6-inch display when unfolded, is also outfitted with Google Tensor G2 and adapts to how you want to use it.   The 2023 Google I\/O event also focused heavily on integrating generative AI into Google's existing products and LLM-driven new apps and functionalities.   In addition to Smart Reply and Smart Compose, Gmail will have a Help Me Write feature that helps you write complete emails in just a few seconds. Google Maps now includes an immersive view for route previews by bike, car, or on foot.   Google Photos offers a Magic Editor with advanced editing capabilities to remove unwanted objects from images, change backgrounds, and even center out-of-frame images.

The updates, announced at its annual Google I\/O developer conference, come as the company is simultaneously trying to push beyond its core advertising business with new devices while also racing to defend its search engine from the threat posed by a wave of new AI-powered tools.            In a sign of where Google\u2019s focus currently lies, the company spent more than 90 minutes teasing a long list of new AI features before mentioning hardware updates.           Here\u2019s what Google announced at the event.           Google became the latest tech company to unveil a foldable smartphone. Like other foldables, the $1799 Pixel Fold features a vertical hinge that can be opened to reveal a tablet-like display. But Google calls the Fold the thinnest foldable on the market.            \u201cIt took some clever engineering work redesigning components like our speakers, our battery and haptics,\u201d said George Hwang, a product manager at Google, on a call ahead of the announcement. The company packed a Pixel phone into a less than 6 mm body \u2013 about two thirds of the thickness of its other Pixel phones.","Jaccard Noise_60":1.0,"Cosine Noise_60":1.0,"EM Noise_60":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_60":1,"Noise_80 Predicted Answer":"Galaxy Z Fold 4","Noise_80 Document Index":"5","Noise_80 Document":"6-inch screen is bright and easy on the eyes \u2014 it\u2019s more than nice enough to take in your daily allotment of YouTube videos and e-books, not to mention running two apps side by side.

This time, Google made one surprising change to the formula: it stuck a higher-resolution main camera sensor in the back, so expect slightly more detailed photos.

Workers will be happy that unemployment remains low, and those out of work are still able to find jobs quickly. Employers will be pleased that labor force participation continues to grow, particularly for prime-age workers. And policymakers at the Federal Reserve will be comforted by the gradual cooldown in the pace of hiring. The US labor market is on a smooth trajectory, but turmoil in the financial market could cause turbulence. This labor market continues to work for workers. Unemployment is very low, but the continued progress in enticing people into the workforce is perhaps more encouraging. The labor force participation rate for workers ages 25 to 54 hit a level previously seen in March 2008, and the last time the employment rate for these workers was this high was May 2001. The number of workers who were unemployed because they had recently lost a job dropped in April, reversing a concerning rise seen in recent months. Payroll job gains continued to moderate, with the three-month moving average ticking down to 222,000 in April, less than half of what it was a year ago. The slowing job gains might concern some people, but this rate of growth is well above the level needed to keep the unemployment rate steady.

{"Query":"What is the name of Google's AI image editing tool?","Correct Answer":["Magic Editor"],"Noise_0 Predicted Answer":"Magic Editor","Noise_0 Document Index":"3","Noise_0 Document":"In addition to new smart devices, Google teased a new AI-enhanced Magic Editor tool at this year\u2019s annual I\/O conference. Though we only got a sneak peek, the results are impressive and prove that an era of advanced image manipulation for the masses isn\u2019t far off, thanks to AI. Of course, AI-powered image editing is nothing new for Google. Handy tools like the Magic Eraser, for removing unwanted distractions, and Photo Unblur, for enhancing soft\/blurred shots, have been around for several years. And Google has been leveraging AI to help organize and surface images in users\u2019 libraries since 2015. But the Magic Editor takes AI-enhanced manipulation a leap further. Not only can users select and edit subjects (similar to using a mask in Lightroom\/Capture One) but with a few taps of the screen you can easily scale and reposition subjects in the frame. The demo also shows the tool's ability to expand an image\u2019s composition through generative AI. Of course, the results aren\u2019t perfect. In the example with the balloons, for instance, the portion of the bench created using generative AI shows a noticeable red tint. Similarly, in the waterfall demo, the area under the subject\u2019s arm shows an obvious repeating pattern in the rocks. These criticisms aside, the power of this tool to dramatically reshape image editing on the fly can\u2019t be understated.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.9999998808,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Magic Editor","Noise_20 Document Index":"6","Noise_20 Document":"There have long been discussions about how far a photo can be edited before it\u2019s no longer a photo, and Google\u2019s tools push us closer to a world where we tap on every image to perfect it, reality or not. Samsung recently brought attention to the power of AI-\u201cenhanced\u201d photos with \u201cSpace Zoom,\u201d a feature that\u2019s supposed to let you capture incredible pictures of the Moon on newer Galaxy devices. In March, a Reddit user tried using Space Zoom on an almost unsalvageable image of the Moon and found that Samsung appeared to add craters and other patches that weren\u2019t actually there. Not only does this run the risk of creating a \u201cfake\u201d image of the Moon, but it also leaves actual space photographers in a strange place, as they spend years mastering the art of capturing the night sky, only for the public to often be presented with fakes. To be fair, there are a ton of similar photography-enhancing features that are built in to smartphone cameras. As my colleague Allison Johnson points out, mobile photography already fakes a lot of things, whether it\u2019s by applying filters or unblurring a photo, and doctored images are nothing new. But Google\u2019s Magic Editor could make a more substantial form of fakery easier and more attractive.","Jaccard Noise_20":1.0,"Cosine Noise_20":0.9999998808,"EM Noise_20":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":1,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"Magic Editor","Noise_40 Document Index":"0","Noise_40 Document":"May 10, 2023 ...

The Apple Vision Pro headset will reportedly be sold in Apple stores with a fitting appointment.  Apple will initially require customers to make an in-store appointment to buy the $3,500 Vision Pro so the headset can be fitted properly and customers can be taught how to use it, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. The headset is designed to wrap around the head and keep out light and the many variables involved in fitting the mask\u2014including multiple head straps, different sized light seals and optional prescription lenses\u2014necessitate the individualized approach, Bloomberg reported. Apple will sell the device at all of its U.S. stores, though the company will reportedly begin the rollout in larger areas like New York and Los Angeles early next year. Bloomberg reports that most stores will only have one or two demo devices due to limited supply and high cost of headsets. The Vision Pro will also go on sale online in its U.S. web store at some point in early 2024, Bloomberg reported, and the complexities of its sale mean the company does not expect to partner with third-party resellers until at least 2025.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.8875223994,"EM Noise_100":0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

Vision Pro marks the company's first entrance into a new product category since the 2015 Apple Watch, with the device introduced at WWDC 2023 in June. A launch is set for early 2024, which means January to late April. While the Apple Vision Pro is definitely a headset, Apple does not use that word when referring to it. Instead, Apple calls it a spatial computer because of its ability to blend digital content with the physical world.  Apple Vision Pro is a mixed reality headset that displays augmented reality content overlaid on world around you, and immersive entirely virtual content, but it's worth noting that the headset is not see through. Everything you see is digital. For augmented reality content that does not make your surroundings disappear, Apple uses cameras that map out what's in front of you, translating that into a digital image augmented by virtual elements.  For a virtual reality experience, Apple shuts off those cameras and can make it seem like you are completely isolated from what's going on around you, allowing you to focus solely on what's being displayed on the headset's screens. This shift between the \"real\" and the \"immersive\" can be controlled with an on-device Digital Crown.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.6666666667,"Cosine Noise_0":0.7481936812,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Vision Pro","Noise_20 Document Index":"7","Noise_20 Document":"CUPERTINO, California, June 5 (Reuters) - Apple (AAPL.O) on Monday unveiled a costly augmented-reality headset called the Vision Pro in its riskiest bet since the introduction of the iPhone more than a decade ago, barging into a market dominated by Meta (META.O). At its annual developer conference, Apple also introduced a raft of new products and features, including a 15-inch MacBook Air, a powerful chip called M2 Ultra, improvements to its iOS software and a long-awaited tweak to prevent its autocorrect from annoyingly changing a common expletive to \"ducking\". The Vision Pro will start at $3,499, more than three times the cost of the priciest headset in Meta's line of mixed and virtual reality devices. The headset will test a market crowded with devices that have yet to gain traction with consumers and put it in direct competition with Facebook-owner Meta after years of clashes between the companies over issues like user privacy and control of developer platforms. Apple emphasized the novelty of the headset's augmented reality features as well as the sports and entertainment partnerships it would offer. The device will use a new chip called R1 that will process information from its sensors in less time than the blink of an eye, Apple said. But the announcements failed to excite Wall Street, which had bid up Apple shares to a record high ahead of the launch. The stock was largely flat in post-market trading.","Jaccard Noise_20":1.0,"Cosine Noise_20":0.9999999404,"EM Noise_20":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":1,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"Apple Reality Pro","Noise_40 Document Index":"0","Noise_40 Document":"Sep 4, 2022 ...

[1\/4]People use cameras as Apple's Vision Pro headsets are on display at Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference at the company's headquarters in Cupertino, California, U.S. June 5, 2023. REUTERS\/Loren Elliott Investors will want to know the overlap between Apple's view of the virtual reality market and that of Meta, which currently controls nearly 80% of the market for AR\/VR devices, according to market research firm IDC. Meta Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has outlined his vision for using headsets to dip in and out of a \"metaverse\" where people can meet virtually to work, play and spend. Apple executives eschewed the term. \"The core difference to me is Zuckerberg is trying to create a virtual world that he wants us to be in, and it seems to me that Apple wants to keep us still anchored in our world and just augment it,\" said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at Creative Strategies. In addition to Meta, Sony Group Corp (6758.T) and ByteDance-owned Pico both produce virtual reality devices. IDC said all these companies sold a total of 8.8 million headsets last year. Apple said it has been working with Adobe (ADBE.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) to put their apps on the new headset, as well as Unity (U.N), a technology company that works with game developers.","Jaccard Noise_60":1.0,"Cosine Noise_60":0.9999999404,"EM Noise_60":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_60":1,"Noise_80 Predicted Answer":"Apple Vision Pro","Noise_80 Document Index":"4","Noise_80 Document":"That's because Apple ditches controllers entirely with the Apple Vision Pro, instead using the headset's many sensors and cameras to allow you to control the device using just your eyes, hands and voice. And these intuitive controls are meant to feel natural as well. Apple says all it takes is turning your head to shift the focus of the display, or a simple tap of your fingers to simulate a mouse click. You can even keep your hands in a natural position rather than holding them in front of you when making gestures. Glancing at a search bar and speaking will even allow you to type into the search bar for easy use. Aside from these new methods of controlling the mixed reality headset, there are two familiar features. First, Siri is back, giving you Apple's famous voice assistant right out of the box. Second, the headset does work with a range of Bluetooth products. In addition to supporting controllers like the PS5 DualSense, it also supports the Apple Magic Keyboard, Mouse and Trackpad in case you don't want to rely on hand gestures or a virtual keyboard.  According to reports, the Apple VR\/AR mixed reality headset \u2014 which we now know as the Apple Vision Pro \u2014 was designed to be a precursor to Apple Glass.\u00a0 And now that we've officially seen the Vision Pro, it's clear that Apple wanted to have a true mixed reality device rather than a VR headset.","Jaccard Noise_80":0.6666666667,"Cosine Noise_80":0.7481936812,"EM Noise_80":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":1,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"Apple Watch","Noise_100 Document Index":"5","Noise_100 Document":"According to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple is planning to announce its first headset as soon as January next year, with potential features including two 4K micro-OLED displays, 15 optical modules, two main processors, Wi-Fi 6E connectivity, eye tracking, object tracking, and hand gesture controls.

After completing Paulson\u2019s memoir, Ryder decamped to Southeast Asia, where she served as a journalist for The Economist and The Wall Street Journal. From there she transitioned into venture capital, another industry where being able to spot the trends with staying power has outsized importance. Her experience on the VC side of the table would come in handy when she would later pitch investors on the idea that would become Maven. As Maven\u2019s business has scaled, Ryder\u2019s storytelling impulses have served her well, whether it\u2019s attracting talent and investors, closing sales, or building a brand identity. All of these functions require Ryder to build a compelling narrative around the need for better healthcare options for women and their families.

Having a child was a monumental event, she believed, affecting a woman\u2019s body, their personal life, and their professional life.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.5,"Cosine Noise_100":0.7620055079,"EM Noise_100":0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}
