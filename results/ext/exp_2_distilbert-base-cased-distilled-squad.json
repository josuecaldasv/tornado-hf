That show also focuses primarily on surgeons rather than emergency medicine or any other department, and features a parent\/child dynamic that is fundamental to the series. Admittedly, Shaun and Glassman on The Good Doctor aren\u2019t technically father and son, but that family element is there. Plus, there's Shaun and Lea, unless their big fight results in a break for good. Griff seems a little less inclined to fully support Sam than Glassman is for Shaun, though!\u00a0 With Sophia Bush the forefront of the show and her character in the title that\u2019s a play on words (\u201cGood Sam\u201d for \u201cGood Samaritan\u201d), there are clear parallels between Good Sam and ABC\u2019s Grey\u2019s Anatomy, which of course stars Ellen Pompeo as Meredith Grey. In addition to the female lead, the two shows share a focus on surgery. That said, Grey\u2019s has been running for 18 seasons so far, so its characters have far more history than even what the pilot exposited about Sam.\u00a0 With Sam revealing early on that she had heart surgery as a child, it\u2019s easy to make a comparison to Ryan Eggold\u2019s Max Goodwin over on NBC, although Max\u2019s struggles with his health happened in the first season of New Amsterdam rather than decades in the past.","Jaccard Noise_40":0.0,"Cosine Noise_40":0.7328847647,"EM Noise_40":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":0,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"ensemble show","Noise_60 Document Index":"4","Noise_60 Document":"That said, Sam and Max have a position of authority in common (or did before Max\u2019s latest big decision), even though the NBC show focuses on multiple different departments in one hospital rather than just surgery.\u00a0 The comparisons between Good Sam and The Resident \u2013 which is Fox\u2019s only medical drama \u2013 are a little fewer and farther between, although there was a strong family dynamic central to The Resident up until Emily VanCamp\u2019s departure and her character's death. Still, there are a lot of found family members on the show, and its success proves that a network doesn\u2019t need multiple medical TV shows to enjoy a long run.\u00a0 Arguably the medical drama with the fewest similarities to Good Sam is also one of the biggest on television: NBC\u2019s Chicago Med. The One Chicago series mostly centers the medical action on the emergency department, although surgery and psych are also important to the storytelling. Med is more of an ensemble show, compared to Good Sam with Sophia Bush as the clear lead. It\u2019s also a spinoff, which fundamentally sets it apart from the other shows in the genre.\u00a0 So, does Good Sam have what it takes to become the next medical TV show hit and follow in the footsteps of those that are already successful? Only time will tell on that front, but Sophia Bush has proven herself as a strong TV actor thanks to One Tree Hill and then Chicago P.D. In an interesting twist, Good Sam is actually airing up against Chicago P.D.","Jaccard Noise_60":0.0,"Cosine Noise_60":0.090307638,"EM Noise_60":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_60":0,"Noise_80 Predicted Answer":"adventure comedies","Noise_80 Document Index":"9","Noise_80 Document":"If Kermit the Frog making his way to Hollywood by way of a swamp in Florida, meeting Fozzie, Gonzo, and Miss Piggy along the way, and featuring cameos by Steve Martin, Richard Pryor, and Mel Brooks doesn\u2019t do anything for you, then I just don\u2019t know what will. \u00a0 The Coen Brothers have had a number of hits, but this 1930s reimagining of The Odyssey is one of the most clever and original adventure comedies of all time. The cast is stacked, the cinematography is well-crafted, and the soundtrack will get stuck in your head all day. \u00a0 This one\u2019s basically just a modern update to Planes, Trains, and Automobiles, but Robert Downey Jr. and Zach Galifianakis still bring a lot of humor and even a little bit of heart. Plus, it was directed by Todd Philips, who made Joker, which is a very different and much darker film, making Due Date all the more interesting. \u00a0 Okay, yes, this one feels a little unorthodox; but when you think about it, \u2018The Wizard of Oz\u2019 is kind of the first cross-country adventure film ever made (not to mention the first one made in color).

Marshall, Omar Maskati, Davi Santos, Michael Stahl-David) round out the secondary characters, most notably Marshall, who plays Dr. Lex Trulie, her best friend hiding a huge secret. Overall, Good Sam riffs on what CBS is known for -- comforting problem-of-the-week dramas -- and adds a new level of spice and interest to the proceedings.

Then, in 2003, Carolyn Bertozzi proposed that click chemistry could be used in studies of biological systems to make it easier to observe vital cellular processes without interfering with them. Bertozzi called this \u201cbioorthogonal\u201d chemistry in a paper\u00a0she and her colleagues published that year. The term has since been\u00a0widely-adopted term in the field. The ability to perform complex reactions in living systems without interfering with natural biological reactions made it possible to study molecules and cellular processes in cells and inside complex organisms such as zebra fish, rather than in laboratory dishes. It has already helped scientists understand an important protein processing reaction called glycosylation, helped to develop molecular imaging molecules that could detect disease in living organisms, and opened up the possibility of selectively delivering drugs to particular tissues in the body. These findings have \u201cled to a revolution in how chemists think about linking molecules together and how to do it in living cells,\u201d \u00c5qvist said. Today\u2019s announcement marks the second time that Sharpless has won a Nobel Prize in Chemistry.

Additionally, in the first three days of its launch, Lost Ark gained over 4.7 million new registered players in the West. Original story: Following its official free-to-play launch on February 11, Lost Ark has already become Steam's second most-played game of all time by concurrent players with an all-time peak of 1,325,305 people. As revealed by SteamDB, Lost Ark passed Counter-Strike: Global Offensive's all-time peak of 1,308,963 players to secure the #2 spot. Considering these all-time peaks tend to happen around a game's release, it may be quite an uphill battle to take down PUBG's record of 3,257,248 players at one time.

Amazon\u2019s recently-published online game Lost Ark has broken several playtime records on the Steam digital storefront. Lost Ark, developed by Smilegate RPG, is a massively-multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) that originally launched in South Korea in late 2019. Players enter the world of Arkesia as young warriors, mages, martial artists, and magic-users, who\u2019ve been chosen by prophecy to search for artifacts capable of saving the world from an awakening force of chaos. Upon its launch on Feb. 11, Lost Ark rapidly climbed Steam\u2019s charts to hit an all-time peak of 1,325,305 players on Feb. 12, as shown by independent trackers like SteamDB. This is the second-highest number for concurrent players ever tracked on Steam, behind the record of 3.26 million that was set in 2018 by PlayerUnknown\u2019s Battlegrounds, and the highest number period for any MMORPG on Steam. This also made Lost Ark the highest-played game on Steam in the 24 hours following its debut. Additionally, Lost Ark was popular among livestreamers and their audiences on Amazon\u2019s Twitch online broadcasting platform.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.6666666667,"Cosine Noise_100":0.7872266173,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

It's yet more history for Diggins who also claimed Team USA's first gold in the sport with Kikkan Randall in the PyeongChang 2018 team sprint. Incredibly, she had suffered from food poisoning on the eve of her final event of the Games. She told Olympics.com that she did not carry much confidence into the race, saying, \"If I'm being honest, 24 hours ago I felt really bad and I just laid in bed yesterday mostly and ate food and drank sport drinks. \"But it worked and I think maybe because it's been so cold and so hard, maybe extra rest is what I needed.\" Given that less-than-ideal preparation, it was perhaps no surprise that Diggins collapsed immediately after crossing the line.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":1.0,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"silver","Noise_20 Document Index":"6","Noise_20 Document":"Jessie Diggins turned herself inside out to win the silver medal in the women\u2019s 30k freestyle Sunday - her second medal of the 2022 Olympic Winter Games.

It\u2019s been a near ever-present in the steam charts\u00a0since its release in February and you\u2019d certainly be hard pushed to find a better Game of the Year contender outside FromSoftware\u2019s latest action RPG. But despite many fans diving back into the game over and over again (there is 6 endings after all), most of the community are desperate to see what the developer does with the game next, especially with regards to more post-launch content. At this point, nothing has been officially announced with both FromSoftware and Publisher Bandai Namco avoiding any concrete answers on the future of the game. That being said, FromSoftware does have a history of releasing DLC for their previous titles. Dark Souls 1-3, Bloodborne and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice all received hefty post-launch support and content updates. There have also been hints in press releases, with one including a quote from Bandai Namco Entertainment President and CEO Yasuo Miyakawa which talks about \u201cexpanding the brand beyond the game itself\u201d. Clearly Bandai Namco know they need to capitalise on a game as significant as Elden Ring, and you would imagine one of the easiest ways to do that would be via post launch content.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.5,"Cosine Noise_100":0.8393336535,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

But Apple didn't detail how much faster it is than last year's A15, and it's not likely to major a big speed boost. The A16 Bionic, built on a 4-nanometer process, sports a faster design with six CPU cores -- the same combination of two powerful and four efficient cores Apple has used for years. Apple didn't say how much faster the A16's high-performance cores are compared with those on the A15, but they use 20% less power, which helps battery life. For the four efficiency cores, Apple didn't offer any comparisons to the A15. \"I think the A16 is very incremental over the A15,\" said\u00a0Anshel Sag, an analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy. Instead of processor speed, Apple \"focused explicitly on camera performance and battery life.\" Without big manufacturing process improvements that shrink transistors, the core data processing circuitry on a chip, designers have a harder time adding features that increase the transistor total.

This guide highlights everything you need to know about the M2 chip, from performance improvements to extra features.    The M2 is Apple's next-generation System on a Chip (SoC) developed for use in Macs and iPads. It marks Apple's continued work to transition away from the Intel chips that were used in Macs up until 2020. As a \"System on a Chip,\" the M2 integrates several different components, including the CPU, GPU, unified memory architecture (RAM), Neural Engine, Secure Enclave, SSD controller, image signal processor, encode\/decode engines, Thunderbolt controller with USB 4 support, and more, all of which power the different features in the Mac. Before Apple silicon, Macs used multiple chips for CPU, I\/O, and security, but Apple's effort to integrate these chips is the reason why the M2 is much faster and more efficient than Intel chips. The unified memory architecture that Apple has included is also a major factor because all of the technologies in the M2 are able to access the same data without having to swap between multiple pools of memory. Built into the M2 chip, the unified memory architecture means the CPU, GPU, and other processor components don't need to copy data between one another, and are able to access the same data pool.","Jaccard Noise_40":0.3333333333,"Cosine Noise_40":0.7838338614,"EM Noise_40":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":0,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"June 6, 2022","Noise_60 Document Index":"0","Noise_60 Document":"Text of this article June 6, 2022 PRESS RELEASE Apple unveils M2, taking the breakthrough performance and capabilities of M1 even further M2 delivers new levels of power-efficient performance and capabilities to the completely redesigned MacBook Air and updated 13-inch MacBook Pro CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA\u00a0Apple today announced M2, beginning the next generation of Apple silicon designed specifically for the Mac.\u00a0Built using second-generation 5-nanometer technology, M2 takes the industry-leading performance per watt of M1 even further with an 18 percent faster CPU, a 35 percent more powerful GPU, and a 40 percent faster Neural Engine.1 It also delivers 50 percent more memory bandwidth compared to M1, and up to 24GB of fast unified memory.

Apple introduced new pricing for iMac in 2021, with the entry-level model costing $1,299. If Apple was to keep on an M1 iMac it could sell an iMac for less than $1,000.

Verne returned the dig later when he pointed out that he used gun cotton to send his men to the Moon, an actual substance. \"Can Mr. Wells show me some 'cavourite'?\", he asked archly.

A little meta here, but sometimes recognition breeds recognition with award shows \u2014 and going into the voting, no artist was more recognized in the nominations at this year\u2019s Grammys than Jon Batiste. The singer\/songwriter\/instrumentalist scored a staggering 11 nods for the evening, including an additional Big Four nomination in song of the year (for \u201cFreedom\u201d), and genre nods that ranged from best R&B performance to best improvised jazz solo to to best American roots song. Such a large number of nominations (three more than any other artist on Sunday) is bound to grab attention, and perhaps a number of ballots from future voters who might\u2019ve otherwise not been familiar: If you\u2019re doing some light research but don\u2019t have time to check out all the nominees you don\u2019t already know, you\u2019d be more likely to check out the artist with 11 nominations than one with just a handful (or only the one, in the case of Taylor Swift and Evermore).

Twitter invited Musk to join its board of directors, an offer he initially accepted before declining. On April 14, Musk made an unsolicited offer to purchase the company, to which Twitter's board initially responded with a \"poison pill\" strategy to resist a hostile takeover, before unanimously accepting Musk's buyout offer of $44\u00a0billion on April 25. Musk stated that he planned to introduce new features to the platform, make its algorithms open-source, combat spambot accounts, and promote free speech.  In July, Musk announced his intention to terminate the agreement, asserting that Twitter had breached their agreement by refusing to crack down on spambot accounts. The company filed a lawsuit against Musk in the Delaware Court of Chancery shortly thereafter, with a trial scheduled for the week of October 17. Weeks before the trial was set to begin, Musk reversed course, announcing that he would move forward with the acquisition.

Mr. Musk, who is one of Twitter\u2019s most active users and has more than 109 million followers, began accumulating shares in the company this year. In April, he struck the deal to buy the company for $44 billion and said he would lift Twitter\u2019s content moderation policies, eliminate spam, add new features and provide more transparency about the algorithms used to promote content. \u201cTwitter has tremendous potential \u2014 I look forward to working with the company and the community of users to unlock it,\u201d he said in a statement in April. But, within weeks, he began questioning the deal. Mr. Musk lashed out at the Twitter executives responsible for content decisions and accused the company of failing to accurately count the spam accounts on its platform. When Parag Agrawal, Twitter\u2019s chief executive, tried debunking Mr. Musk\u2019s claims, Mr. Musk responded by tweeting a poop emoji. By July, Mr. Musk had decided that he no longer wanted to own Twitter, arguing that he had been misled about the amount of spam on the platform. He announced his intent to abandon the acquisition. Twitter sued Mr. Musk to force him to carry out the agreement. The company accused Mr. Musk of trying to back out of the deal because the economic downturn had caused a decline in his personal wealth. Mr. Musk had agreed to personally provide roughly $33 billion of the $44 billion deal.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.9033486843,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"$44 billion","Noise_20 Document Index":"6","Noise_20 Document":"Oct 7, 2022 ...

A group of banks, including Morgan Stanley and Bank of America, signed on earlier this year to loan $12.5 billion that Musk needed to buy Twitter and take it private. Solid contracts with Musk bound the banks to the financing, although changes in the economy and debt markets since April have likely made the terms less attractive.

Billionaire Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal said Friday that he and his Kingdom Holding Company rolled over a combined $1.89 billion in existing Twitter shares, making them the company\u2019s largest shareholder after Musk. Another equity investor, the cryptocurrency exchange Binance, confirmed Friday that it put in $500 million.  The more equity investors kicked in for the deal, the less Musk would have had to pay on his own. Most of Musk\u2019s wealth is tied up in shares of his electric car company.

It was a match of historic proportions for both players: Nadal was attempting to surpass an all-time record of 20 major men's singles titles, shared with rivals, Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer, by winning a record 21st major title, and to become the fourth man to complete the double career Grand Slam (after Roy Emerson, Rod Laver, and Novak Djokovic), while Medvedev was seeking to become the first man in the Open Era to win his first two major titles at consecutive events (having won the 2021 US Open title).  Nadal defeated Medvedev, 2\u20136, 6\u20137(5\u20137), 6\u20134, 6\u20134, 7\u20135, in 5 hours and 24 minutes to win his second Australian Open title, and a then all-time record 21st major men's singles title. This was the second-longest major final in history after the 2012 Australian Open final, in which Nadal also participated.[1] Nadal became the first player in the Open Era to win an Australian Open final after losing the first two sets, and the first to do so since Emerson in 1965.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.2794936895,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":0,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Rafael Nadal","Noise_20 Document Index":"0","Noise_20 Document":"Rafael Nadal defeated Daniil Medvedev in the final, 2\u20136, 6\u20137(5\u20137), 6\u20134, 6\u20134, 7\u20135 to win the men's singles tennis title at the 2022 Australian Open.","Jaccard Noise_20":1.0,"Cosine Noise_20":1.0,"EM Noise_20":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":1,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"Rafael Nadal","Noise_40 Document Index":"0","Noise_40 Document":"Rafael Nadal defeated Daniil Medvedev in the final, 2\u20136, 6\u20137(5\u20137), 6\u20134, 6\u20134, 7\u20135 to win the men's singles tennis title at the 2022 Australian Open.[1] It was his second Australian Open title and 21st major singles title overall, surpassing the all-time record he had jointly held with Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic.[2][3] Nadal became the fourth man, after Roy Emerson, Rod Laver, and Djokovic, to achieve the double career Grand Slam, and the second in the Open Era.[4] He also became the first man in the Open Era to win an Australian Open final after losing the first two sets.[5] This marked the third consecutive year a man trailed by two sets in a major final yet rallied to win, following Djokovic's two-set comeback at the 2021 French Open and Dominic Thiem's at the 2020 US Open.[6]  Djokovic was the three-time reigning champion,[7] but did not compete after his visa was cancelled shortly before the tournament began due to an intervention from Australia's Immigration Minister Alex Hawke, citing risks to public health and good order in Australia.[8] That meant Nadal was the only former champion (2009) to compete in the tournament, with both Federer and Stan Wawrinka sidelined by injury.","Jaccard Noise_40":1.0,"Cosine Noise_40":1.0,"EM Noise_40":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":1,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"Blake: Djokovic","Noise_60 Document Index":"3","Noise_60 Document":"Jan 15, 2023 ...

By Matthew Futterman WIMBLEDON, England \u2014 The opponents and details change from year to year, but the bottom line has remained the same. With his trademark steeliness, Novak Djokovic defeated Nick Kyrgios in the men\u2019s final at Wimbledon on Sunday to win his 21st Grand Slam singles title. Djokovic seized control of the match late in the third set, then used his signature mix of steady power and relentless discipline to keep Kyrgios at bay to win, 4-6, 6-3, 6-4, 7-6 (3), in 3 hours 1 minute. The victory gave Djokovic his seventh singles title at Wimbledon and his fourth in a row. He secured the trophy he cherishes more than any other with his 28th consecutive match win at Wimbledon. It was his 32nd Grand Slam final.

Yesterday, we posted\u00a0our Tesla Q1 2022 earnings preview\u00a0with Wall Street expectations and crowdsourced expectations. The Wall Street consensus for this quarter was $17.659 billion in revenue and earnings of $2.26 per share.

Warner Bros. Discovery board member John Malone told CNBC in 2021 he'd \"like to see CNN evolve back to the kind of journalism that it started with, and actually have journalists, which would be unique and refreshing.\" But CNN journalists argued this was a straw man. They claimed they weren't advocating for anything other than truth. Several took offense to Malone's comments as a slight to their journalistic skills. CNN can change the tone of its programming around Trump, who is the front-runner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination. It can tone down hyperbole and rhetoric around his lies and exaggerations, depending on the situation. Still, that's not a business strategy. CNN+ may have been doomed to be nothing more than a fledgling streaming service. But it represented hope for how a brand could transition toward the future. A successful leader of CNN will need to figure out a way to boost ratings with compelling programming while also fostering new digital businesses that bring in revenue and younger audiences. It's possible CNN+ would have never taken off, and Licht would have spent the past year doubling down on a flawed concept that his Discovery bosses never liked \u2014 which probably would have led to his firing anyway. Investors thumbed their nose at increased spending on streaming services last year, so any plan around CNN+ needed to emphasize its long-term appeal.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.4605569839,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

For years now, Musk has stated that Tesla would keep gradually increasing the price of its Full Self-Driving (FSD) package as functionality improves leading to the actual final form of the product, which is, as its name suggests, the capacity to fully drive autonomously.  However, the feature hasn\u2019t lived up to its name so far. It has been in beta for two years now, and it is still far from self-driving. Technically, the system is able to both activate and attempt to drive in most areas, including across intersections, but the responsibility remains with the driver, who needs to be paying attention at all times and be ready to take control. Many see the willingness to take responsibility for the system as the most important step companies developing self-driving systems can take toward achieving this goal. Tesla has made it clear that it is not there yet and participating in the FSD Beta comes with a bunch of warnings that make it clear the responsibility is still with the driver. But Tesla sees every new FSD update as a step closer to the goal, and it believes that some of those updates even warrant price increases for the package.

However, it remains to be seen whether the AI boom will become the future of the technology industry or if it will only be a passing trend because many of these companies are increasing their profits thanks to AI. The MATANA group is composed of the six largest and most influential technology companies: Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA), and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN).

Additionally, Alphabet has diversified its business beyond searches, expanding into areas such as digital advertising, cloud services, and artificial intelligence (IA).

While investigating the events that led to their mentor's demise, the heroes become embroiled in an ancient conflict between two secret organizations fighting for control of Gotham: the Court of Owls and the League of Shadows.

Outside of the story, players are able to complete side missions to unlock additional content and collectible items. A cooperative online multiplayer mode is also included, allowing two players to play through the single-player campaign together while progressing in their own game.

{"Query":"Who stars as Susie Wallis in Susie Searches?","Correct Answer":["Kiersey Clemons"],"Noise_0 Predicted Answer":"Sophie Kargman","Noise_0 Document Index":"5","Noise_0 Document":"festivals Toronto Film Festival  Ryan Coleman @repulsivecream Share this Share this Sophie Kargman attempts to expand her 2020 short film into a feature-length picture, with mixed results. Midway through the world premiere screening of Susie Searches, I sat as hot, electric colors slashed across the screen, as zany, canned sound effects erupted from the speakers, and as lines with clear comic intent left the mouths of characters and seemed to freeze mid-air, shiver, and falter over a silent, stone-faced audience. And I wondered \u2014 what is going on? Susie Searches is the feature debut of Los Angeles-based actress, writer, and director Sophie Kargman. In 2020, Kargman co-wrote (with William Day Frank) and directed a short version of this feature. The primary difference here is Kargman swapping herself out as the lead actress for Kiersey Clemons, whose star-making opportunity has eluded her since her promising breakout in 2015\u2019s Dope. Now, we know why. As you might expect of a film with a character\u2019s name in the title, Susie Searches is all about Susie Wallis, a bright college student whose compulsive meticulousness and true crime obsession have left her friendless.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.5125677586,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":0,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Kiersey Clemons","Noise_20 Document Index":"2","Noise_20 Document":"Sep 9, 2022 ...

Everyone wants to be a hero. But what lengths might one go to get there? This is the winsome yet disturbing journey at the center of Susie Searches.\u00a0 Kiersey Clemons stars as Susie Wallis, a socially awkward college student with a mind for solving mysteries. Naturally, she has her own true crime podcast called Susie Searches, so when fellow student\/meditation influencer Jesse (Alex Wolff) goes missing, her interest in cracking the case isn't exactly selfless. If she finds the internet-adored victim, she and her podcast could score the validation she desperately craves. Whether she's squeezing the sheriff (Jim Gaffigan) for clues, eying a convenient creep (Ken Marino) as a suspect, or scouting out evidence, Susie is on a mission to save the day\u2026and promote herself.\u00a0 Forget the hardscrabble detectives of film noir; Susie has more in common with Oliver Putnam than she does Sam Spade. Rather than a gun and a trench coat, she carries a big smile smacked with colorful braces and a disarming demeanor that tends to make people underestimate her.

The announcement of Tears of the Kingdom under the name \"Breath of the Wild 2\" which Nintendo Called at the time \"The Sequel to Breath of the Wild\" was celebrated by fans across the world as Breath of the Wild was one of the most popular games on the Nintendo Switch and was known throughout the gaming community, especially after winning the Game of the Year award at the 2017 Japan Game Awards.[13] Many fans speculated about whether Princess Zelda would be a playable character or if multiplayer would be added, but when asked, Aonuma declined to answer.[14]  When the title of Tears of the Kingdom was revealed during the September 13, 2022 Nintendo Direct, many fans were unsure whether the name referred to tears as in crying, or tears as in rips.[15] Nintendo cleared up the confusion a few days later and confirmed that the name refers to tears as in crying.","Jaccard Noise_60":1.0,"Cosine Noise_60":0.9871771336,"EM Noise_60":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_60":1,"Noise_80 Predicted Answer":"May 12","Noise_80 Document Index":"5","Noise_80 Document":"May 20, 2023 ...

Behind the scenes, the sequel was written by Jen D'Angelo and was originally set to be directed by Adam Shankman. Following a scheduling conflict (thanks to Shankman's work on Disenchanted), Anne Fletcher took over but Shankman stayed on as executive producer. Along with the official announcement in May 2021, we got our first plot details about what we can expect from the sequel. \"Three young women accidentally bring the Sanderson Sisters back to modern-day Salem and must figure out how to stop the child-hungry witches from wreaking a new kind of havoc on the world,\" it reads. This does sound a little bit like the book sequel that was released in July 2018 which centred on Max and Allison's daughter Poppy, her friend Travis and a girl called Isabella who Poppy has a crush on. In order to impress Isabella, Poppy sneaks into the Sanderson house during a blood moon and accidentally brings the sisters back to life. It's unclear if this is exactly what will happen in the movie sequel, so might end up being non-canon.

Disney released the first trailer for the highly-anticipated sequel in late June and if you weren't aware of the demand for the movie, the trailer notched up more than 40 million views in its first 24 hours.

As mentioned above, the first trailer for Hocus Pocus 2 arrived on June 28, 2022 and while it was low on plot, it was high on spookiness. The trailer teased the return of the Sanderson Sisters and featured other classic Hocus Pocus items such as the Black Flame Candle.  Disney then revealed the second trailer for Hocus Pocus 2 on September 9, 2022 and it was more plot-focused than the teaser.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.25,"Cosine Noise_100":0.7884168625,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

The 45-year-old leader recited the ritual oath of office before Italian President Sergio Mattarella on Saturday after her party Brothers of Italy won more than 25 percent of the vote in snap elections in late September. She pledged to act \u201cin the exclusive interests of the nation\u201d \u2013 a promise then repeated by her 24 ministers, six of them women. The ceremony took place a day after Meloni along with her coalition partners \u2013 hardliner Matteo Salvini of the League party and Forza Italia\u2019s TV tycoon Silvio Berlusconi \u2013 unveiled their cabinet. The government is expected to face confidence votes in parliament next week. Forza Italia\u2019s Antonio Tajani is now the country\u2019s foreign minister. He has a long history with European institutions and was president of the European Parliament in 2017.

At the time, there were 87 total members in the group, and a lawsuit filed by a Norwegian reporter, Kjersti Flaa, who had thrice been denied admittance to the group, accused members of accepting \u201cthousands of dollars in emoluments\u201d from members of the industry who were campaigning for recognition at the Globes. (A lawyer for the association said the lawsuit was a \u201ca transparent attempt to shake down the H.F.P.A. based on jealousy,\u201d The Los Angeles Times reported.) One story of wooing voters became emblematic of a reputation for accepting lavish perks. The Netflix comedy series \u201cEmily in Paris,\u201d which was the subject of lackluster reviews, received two nominations after dozens of association members flew to Paris to visit the \u201cEmily\u201d set and were put up by the Paramount Network at a five-star hotel. There was also scrutiny over how much members were paid for their involvement. According to filings from the tax year ending in June 2019, the nonprofit paid more than $3 million in salaries and other compensation to members and staff.

Here\u2019s how it works Home \/ Features \/ Google Pixel Watch 2: the features we want from a smartwatch successor  The first Pixel Watch was a solid start - but there's room for improvement Android fans had a lot to like about the Google Pixel Watch when it landed in October 2022: a minimal design, slick Fitbit integration, and the best version of the firm\u2019s Wear OS software to date. Google\u2019s first wearable effort wasn\u2019t perfect, though. Battery life was a real downer, and the \u201cone size fits all\u201d approach was off-kilter with the rest of the smartwatch world. That leaves plenty of areas for a Pixel Watch 2 to improve upon. At the time of writing there\u2019s still a fairly long wait before a successor is set to turn up \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t look to the future, or come up with a laundry list of things we\u2019d like to see make the cut by the time it does. Google hasn\u2019t said anything official about a second Pixel Watch. At the annual I\/O event in May 2023, it quickly breezed over WearOS to leave more time to focus on AI, coding and other upcoming hardware like the Pixel Fold smartphone.

In addition, the usual crew of third-party vendors will release their own spins on the 4090, so look for versions to come from companies like Gigabyte, MSI and PNY. So what do you get for all that money? For starters, you get one of the biggest GPUs we've ever seen, built on Nvidia's Lovelace architecture and sporting 76 billion transistors. That's nearly three times the 28 billion transistors on the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090, which translates to greater potential power. You also get 16,384 CUDA cores, which are basically parallel processors that run Nvidia's Compute Unified Device Architecture (the aforementioned CUDA). These are the workhorses which do the heavy lifting of rendering graphics on your PC, and the 4090 has nearly 6,000 more than the old Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090.\u00a0 That means we should see significantly improved performance when gaming on a 4090, which can achieve boost clock speeds of 2.52 GHz.  Memory-wise, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 ships with 24GB of DDR6X RAM that we believe will be as fast as 21Gbps.\u00a0 A graphics card's main feature is to draw images onscreen as fast and beautiful as possible, and the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 is no exception.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.2955928445,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

Here's what the subscription plan offers and whether you should sign up for YouTube Premium. If you love watching videos on YouTube, you might have considered subscribing to YouTube Premium. But is YouTube Premium worth it? Let's take a look at what YouTube Premium offers, what you should know about the service, and how to decide if it's worthwhile for you. YouTube Premium (formerly YouTube Red) costs $11.99 per month, after a one-month free trial. If you're sure about the service and want to commit for a year, there's an annual plan available for $119.99. That's two months of savings for paying upfront.  There are also two other plans available for families and students. The Family plan for YouTube Premium costs $22.99 per month. It allows you to add up to five other people (six total members) who are at least 13 years old and live in your household so they get the same benefits. Per YouTube's terms, these people must live at the same address as you. If you're a student who can provide verification (required each year), the price of the Student YouTube Premium plan is $6.99 per month instead. Whether the cost of Premium is worth it or not depends on how many of YouTube Premium's benefits you use.

Being a YouTube Premium member still has some perks in regards to Originals, though. In addition to ad-free access, subscribers get access to bonus content like deleted scenes and director's cuts. Have a look at the YouTube Originals channel to see what's available. Some videos, marked as Premium, are only available for subscribers. Whether you're interested in anything on offer is a different story. A YouTube Premium subscription also includes access to YouTube Music Premium. If you're not familiar, YouTube Music is Google's music streaming service. It replaced Google Play Music, which was retired in late 2020. Like Spotify and other music streaming platforms, YouTube Music is available for free. With YouTube Music Premium, you also get ad-free access, the ability to play music in the background, and the option to download music for offline listening.

In the latest leadership contest, Mr Sunak racked up the support of his fellow MPs early, and fast. He crossed the 100 nominations he needed long before the deadline - including from MPs that had previously backed Truss or Boris Johnson. He clashed with the former PM during the previous leadership race, claiming her plan to borrow money during an inflation crisis was a \"fairytale\" that would plunge the economy into chaos. His parents came to the UK from east Africa and are both of Indian origin. Mr Sunak was born in Southampton in 1980, where his father was a GP and his mother ran a pharmacy. He went to the boarding school Winchester College, then studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Oxford, and business at Stanford in America. He is now the first British Asian prime minister. Mr Sunak was first elected as an MP in 2015 - for Richmond in north Yorkshire - but rose quickly, and was made finance minister - or chancellor - in February 2020 under Boris Johnson.

Hunt's role as a stabilizing force may help him retain the role that he was appointed to by Truss.

Schumer speaks after Dems projected to keep control of Senate  The 2022 midterm elections shaped up to be some of the most consequential in the nation's recent history, with control of Congress at stake. All 435 seats in the House and 35 of 100 seats in the Senate were on the ballot, as well as several influential gubernatorial elections in battleground states like Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Democrats were defending their narrow majorities in both chambers and retained control of the Senate, though control of the House isn't yet clear. But a Republican flip of the lower chamber would be enough to curtail most of President Joe Biden's legislative agenda and would likely result in investigations against his administration and even his family. Republican Juan Ciscomani will win in his election bid to represent Arizona's 6th Congressional District, ABC News can report, defeating Democrat Kirsten Engel and flipping a House seat for Republicans from retiring Democratic Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick. With 99% of the expected vote in, Ciscomani is leading Engel by 3,502 votes, 50.5%-49.5%. Ciscomani, a longtime aide to Republican Gov.

Not only is fan favorite David Tennant returning to the franchise for a series of specials, but Ncuti Gatwa has been cast as the Fifteenth Doctor, the first black actor to play the iconic hero. While little is known about the new Doctor, the BBC did announce that Millie Gibson has been cast as Ruby Sunday, the Doctor's new companion. Much attention has been paid to Tennant's return and Gatwa's casting, but Gibson is an exciting choice for the franchise. The companion is just as important for Doctor Who as the Doctor himself, so the person cast in the role takes on a big responsibility. At just 18 years old, she will be the youngest person to be cast as a companion and was only a one-year-old when the series was revived in 2005. Is the young star ready for such a major role?

This is notable for several reasons, but the biggest is that the companion is usually the audience avatar.

Handout \/ Getty Images  On November 19, 2022, Naomi Biden married Peter Neal on the South Lawn of the White House, making it the first wedding held at the presidential residence in almost a decade. Their wedding venue wasn\u2019t the only show-stopping detail that gained media recognition: President Joe Biden\u2019s granddaughter donned an outfit for her big day that made bridal fashion history, and everyone took note.\u00a0   The blushing bride radiated timeless elegance in a custom long-sleeve Chantilly lace wedding dress with a mock neck and organza floral embroidery made by Ralph Lauren. Although her dress resembled the bridal silhouettes that Nicky Hilton, Pippa Middleton, and Grace Kelly wore, what really took her ensemble to the next level was a sweeping cathedral-length veil made of silk organza, featuring a custom Chantilly lace border and embroidery.

Granted that revival retcons the Criminal Minds finale in several ways, it's essentially the same thing. That being said, Paramount+ just cannot simply use the title Criminal Minds season 16 because the project is different in a couple of significant ways from its original run. That includes veering away from its episodic storytelling format to a more serialized one, not to mention being darker and more disturbing than CBS' iteration. By giving the Criminal Minds revival a new title, Paramount+ allows it to be both a reboot and a continuation of the CBS series. Calling it Criminal Minds season 16 could also be confusing if the project doesn\u2019t address every single plot line that the finale left loose, which puts a lot of burden on the new series. Having its official title of Criminal Minds: Evolution quickly establishes that the show is part of the Criminal Minds brand, which could entice some formers fans to check it out, especially those who haven\u2019t been keeping track of Paramount+\u2019s efforts to bring back the BAU on the small screen. Overall, despite the series of changes coming the BAU's way, it's all for the better.","Jaccard Noise_20":0.0,"Cosine Noise_20":0.4334653616,"EM Noise_20":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":0,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"Criminal Minds: Evolution","Noise_40 Document Index":"1","Noise_40 Document":"Paramount+'s new Criminal Minds series is Criminal Minds: Evolution.

Memphis Depay is fit again and is expected to start as one of the two strikers. The question is whether Van Gaal chooses Steven Bergwijn as a second striker and uses Gakpo as attacking midfielder, or uses Gakpo as that second striker just like he did against Qatar. If Van Gaal takes the latter approach, Steven Berghuis and Davy Klaassen could provide an offensive impulse in midfield, leaving De Jong free to create and pick his passes. The fitness of the teams is also an important factor. Van Gaal indicated previously that his team is fit just in time for the knockout phase, having been able to rest some key players against Qatar. Meanwhile, the US are coming off a grueling game against Iran, in which Pulisic hobbled off with a \"pelvic contusion\" -- he's day-to-day in terms of being ready for Saturday -- and most of US coach Gregg Berhalter's best players put in heavy work.

The preview may look like a candy-colored dreamland\u2014but after she's leaves Barbieland, Barbie (and... Ken) go on an epic adventure to the human world in search of true happiness.  Barbie is Gerwig's latest directorial endeavor, which she wrote alongside her partner, Noah Baumbach.

While they might share similar physical attributes - long blonde hair, blue eyes, a wide smile - Robbie and Barbie also share somewhat similar career trajectories.  After all, Barbie has been known to have more than 150 careers on her CV, from registered nurse to rock star, veterinarian to aerobics instructor, pilot to police officer.

The company has also faced criticism for its handling of the situation and the toxic work environment that allegedly exists within the company. This has resulted in significant public backlash, with some fans and employees calling for boycotts and protests. Alegre\u2019s departure from Activision to Yuga Labs may be seen as a positive move for those who are critical of Activision\u2019s leadership and culture. It\u2019s worth noting that the gaming industry and the NFT space have both been the subject of intense scrutiny and controversy in recent years. The allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination at Activision Blizzard have been a particularly significant source of controversy in the gaming industry. Meanwhile, the NFT space has faced criticism for its environmental impact and the high levels of speculation and price volatility surrounding some NFTs. Furthermore, the recent fake news surrounding Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) highlights the need for responsible and informed reporting in the NFT space.

But it\u2019s also symbolic of del Toro\u2019s wider work to date \u2013 the perfect example of his passion for stories which illuminate our humanity, even in the face of dehumanising oppression.

An asteroid just spotted for the first time seems to have been circling Earth for decades.\u00a0 Our planet has a pretty permanent relationship with the moon, but occasionally Earth's gravity can also capture small asteroids that then spend a period of time orbiting us as a sort of temporary satellite. This has happened at least twice this century, with the \"mini moons\" hanging around for just a few years or less, but newly discovered asteroid 2022 YG appears to have been trapped in a bizarre orbit for a number of decades.\u00a0 The curious space rock was first observed on Dec. 15. Interestingly, one of the first people to spot it was amateur astronomer Gennadiy Borisov of Crimea, who is also known for discovering the first known interstellar comet, which now bares his name.\u00a0 Asteroid 2022 YG, as it has initially been cataloged, looks to be between 52 and 98 feet (16 to 30 meters) in diameter. Early computer models of its orbit show that it takes about a year to circle Earth once and that it has been doing so since sometime around 1961. Run the simulation into the future, and it looks as though the asteroid will continue to act as a quasi-satellite until 2181 when it may finally break free from Earth's gravitational hold.","Jaccard Noise_60":1.0,"Cosine Noise_60":1.0,"EM Noise_60":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_60":1,"Noise_80 Predicted Answer":"Dr. Berdeu","Noise_80 Document Index":"4","Noise_80 Document":"Anthony Berdeu from the National Astronomical Research Institute of Thailand and colleagues used images from the Very Large Telescope (V.L.T.) in Chile to take a closer look at Elektra, and they found evidence for a previously hidden moon inside the orbits of the other two. \u201cThis is the first asteroid with three moons,\u201d Dr. Berdeu said. \u201cWe are pretty confident. It\u2019s quite exciting.\u201d Their results were published Tuesday in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics. At a paltry one mile across, the moon would be slightly smaller than its siblings at 1.2 and 3.7 miles across. It swings around Elektra once every 16 hours at a distance of only 220 miles. To an observer standing on the third moon\u2019s surface, Elektra would loom large in the sky. Dr. Berdeu says he was able to find the moon using a new algorithm to eke out its extremely faint light in images taken by the V.L.T. The data reduction techniques employed by the algorithm allowed for a sharper image of Elektra and its surroundings. Dr. Yang, who was not involved in this paper, said that she and other astronomers had \u201cbeen trying to look for quadruple systems for a while,\u201d and that her team also saw tantalizing hints of this third moon in their studies of 130 Elektra.","Jaccard Noise_80":0.0,"Cosine Noise_80":0.3098330498,"EM Noise_80":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":0,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"AdrienCoffinet","Noise_100 Document Index":"7","Noise_100 Document":"A new co-orbital asteroid for Earth? @AdrienCoffinet noticed that newly-discovered asteroid 2022 YG has been circling Earth as a quasi asteroid since 1961 and will continue to do so until 2181.

Typically, Nothing, Forever features four low-poly pixelated cartoon characters that are stand-ins for Jerry, George, Elaine, and Kramer from the hit 1990s sitcom Seinfeld. They sit around a New York apartment and talk about life, and sometimes the topics of conversation unexpectedly get deep, such as in this viewer-captured segment where they discussed the afterlife. Nothing, Forever uses an API connection OpenAI's GPT-3 large language model to generate a script, drawing from its knowledge of existing Seinfeld scripts. Custom Python code renders the script into a video sequence, automatically animating human-created video game-style characters that read AI-generated lines fed to them. One of its creators provided more technical details on how it works in a Reddit comment from December. As a new media experiment, the faux-Seinfeld stream often feels awkward and unfunny, but it's still interesting because viewers never know what the characters will talk about next.","Jaccard Noise_80":1.0,"Cosine Noise_80":1.0,"EM Noise_80":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":1,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"Seinlanguage","Noise_100 Document Index":"0","Noise_100 Document":"Many terms were coined, popularized, or re-popularized in the series' run and have become part of popular culture,[35] including \"Yada, yada, yada\",[36] \"No soup for you!\", \"Master of my domain\", and \"Not that there's anything wrong with that.\"  The lexicon of Seinfeldian code words and recurring phrases that evolved around particular episodes is referred to as Seinlanguage, which is also the title of Jerry Seinfeld's best-selling book on humor.[33] These terms include \"man hands\", \"shrinkage\", \"regift\", and \"double dip\".  A signature of Seinfeld is its theme music. Composed by Jonathan Wolff, it consists of distinct solo sampled electric bass riffs that open the show and connect the scenes, often accompanied by beatboxing.[37] The bass music eventually replaced the original piano\/synth music by Jep Epstein when it was played again after the first broadcast of the pilot episode. The show lacked a traditional title track and the riffs were played over the first moments of dialogue or action. They vary throughout each episode and are played in an improvised funk style, matching the timing of Seinfeld's stand-up comedy delivery or transitions in the editing. An additional musical theme with an ensemble, led by a synthesized mid-range brass instrument, ends each episode.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.2564151883,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

In February, the US Copyright Office Review Board rejected [PDF] a second request to grant copyright to a computer-generated landscape titled \"A Recent Entrance to Paradise\" because it was created without human authorship.

Pikmin 4 is set to launch for the Nintendo Switch on July 21 and marks the newest numbered entry in the real-time strategy series in over ten years, making its release quite the big deal for hardcore fans. Instead of playing as Captain Olimar (who most people know from Super Smash Bros. at this point) or any of his space explorer comrades, gamers will get to customize their own character (a series first). There are not too many options available, but it's still a step forward in terms of a character creator in a Nintendo first-party title. Pikmin 4 comes out in a couple of days and retails for $59.99, the same price as most other major games on the Switch. People who decided to pre-order the game digitally via the Switch eShop are probably wondering just when they'll be able to actually boot the game and start playing --that's where this guide comes into play.

Amazon is drawing criticism for its plan to acquire Roomba maker iRobot for $1.7 billion in an effort to expand its footprint in the home devices and consumer robotics markets. Ron Knox, a senior researcher at the Institute for Local Self Reliance, has called on regulators to challenge the deal, calling it the \"most dangerous, threatening\" acquisition in the e-commerce behemoth's history. In a lengthy Twitter thread on Aug. 5, Knox argued that the deal would take Amazon's biggest rival out of the market and allow it to beat the remaining competition through predatory pricing. \"Jeff Bezos has said that Amazon wants to buy its way to dominance. By snatching up Roomba and pairing it with its vast monopoly power fueled by its Prime system, it would do just that,\" he said. \"There may be other smart vacuums today, but there won't be once Amazon owns Roomba.","Jaccard Noise_20":1.0,"Cosine Noise_20":1.0,"EM Noise_20":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":1,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"Amazon","Noise_40 Document Index":"0","Noise_40 Document":"Aug 5, 2022 ...

LLaMA comes in four size variants: 7B, 13B, 33B, and 65B parameters. The paper shows that training smaller foundation models on large enough tokens is desirable, as it requires less computing power and resources. The 65B parameter models have been trained on 1.4 trillion tokens, while the LLaMA 7B model has been trained on 1 trillion tokens. Just a few weeks after the release of LLaMA, the open-source community embraced it by creating an optimized version and expanding its use cases. Now, you can fine-tune LLaMA using LoRA (reduces the number of trainable parameters for fine-tuning) and train a chatbot with Stanford Alpaca. Lightning AI has also joined the trend by providing an open-source, from-scratch rewrite of LLaMA called Lit-LLaMA.

On July 18, 2023, in partnership with Microsoft, Meta announced Llama 2, the next generation of LLaMA. Meta trained and released Llama 2 in three model sizes: 7, 13, and 70 billion parameters.","Jaccard Noise_60":0.5,"Cosine Noise_60":0.7716036439,"EM Noise_60":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_60":1,"Noise_80 Predicted Answer":"lit_llama","Noise_80 Document Index":"6","Noise_80 Document":"import LLaMA, LLaMAConfig  # initialize configs  lora_dropout = 0.05  config = LLaMAConfig.from_name(\"7B\")  config.block_size = block_size  # initlize model with LoRA  with lora(r=lora_r, alpha=lora_alpha, dropout=lora_dropout, enabled=True):  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 model = LLaMA(config)  # mark only LoRA injected layers for training  mark_only_lora_as_trainable(model)   from lit_llama.model import LLaMA, LLaMAConfig  # initialize configs  lora_dropout = 0.05  config","Jaccard Noise_80":0.0,"Cosine Noise_80":0.4268268943,"EM Noise_80":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":0,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"model import Block","Noise_100 Document Index":"6","Noise_100 Document":"# Load model configs  \u00a0 \u00a0 config = LLaMAConfig.from_name(\"7B\")  \u00a0 \u00a0 config.block_size = block_size  \u00a0 \u00a0 config.vocab_size = 100\u00a0 # from prepare_shakespeare.py  \u00a0 \u00a0 # \u26a1\ufe0f\u26a1\ufe0f\u26a1\ufe0f\u26a1\ufe0f\u26a1\ufe0f initialize model \u26a1\ufe0f\u26a1\ufe0f\u26a1\ufe0f\u26a1\ufe0f\u26a1\ufe0f  \u00a0 \u00a0 with fabric.device:  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 model = LLaMA(config)  \u00a0 \u00a0 # \u26a1\ufe0f\u26a1\ufe0f\u26a1\ufe0f\u26a1\ufe0f\u26a1\ufe0f Setup model and optimizer for distributed training \u26a1\ufe0f\u26a1\ufe0f\u26a1\ufe0f\u26a1\ufe0f\u26a1\ufe0f  \u00a0 \u00a0 model = fabric.setup_module(model)  \u00a0 \u00a0 optimizer = torch.optim.AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=learning_rate, weight_decay=weight_decay, betas=(beta1, beta2))  \u00a0 \u00a0 optimizer = fabric.setup_optimizers(optimizer)  \u00a0 \u00a0 train(fabric, model, optimizer, train_data, val_data)   from lightning.fabric.strategies import FSDPStrategy  import torch  from torch.distributed.fsdp.wrap import transformer_auto_wrap_policy  from lit_llama.model import Block, LLaMA, LLaMAConfig  def main():","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.179834038,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

Hokie Hi weekend featured Friday and Saturday celebrations with an evening tribute to the fallen 32 from April 16th 2007.  The morning on Saturday was the 3.2 mile Run and Walk for Remembrance, and the crowd there was estimated to be 15,000 or so.  The weather in Blacksburg not only cooperated, it assisted by being comfortably warm, without being hot, and a light breeze was blowing.  It was a magnificent way to honor the fallen and celebrate their memories as Hokies.

On his very first throw, the true freshman fired a pass off his back foot, which found Tucker Holloway down the sidelines for a touchdown. The 39-yard passing score energized the crowd and introduced Pop Watson to the fanbase.

But those countries are something India is not: rich. Even the lower- to middle-income countries with Apple stores, such as Brazil, Thailand and Turkey, have per-capita incomes several times higher than India\u2019s.

This year, that includes both hardware and software \u2014 and, as you might imagine, lots and lots of talk about AI. Here's everything you need to know.

The phone shares a lot of DNA with the $600 Pixel 7, including its Tensor G2 chipset, eight gigs of RAM, and design, which is nearly indistinguishable from its more expensive cousin.

What I loved about it and what I will say and what I think about, again, the power of the play is that you don't see the perpetrator. You don't see Julian. You don't see the physical assault take place. But it's all about language and stillness and her telling you what it is that she's experiencing. You know, it's incredibly intimate and exposing. And I think the way in which the assault is depicted is very rare. And I think in a way, that's what makes it all the more powerful.","Jaccard Noise_80":0.0,"Cosine Noise_80":0.3509363234,"EM Noise_80":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":0,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"Suzie Miller","Noise_100 Document Index":"5","Noise_100 Document":"The production has grossed close to $1 million for several weeks of its run, with an average ticket price hovering around $150 and capacity close to 100 percent.  \tThe recoupment comes a week after Comer won the Tony Award for best lead actress in a play.

Schwarzer and Schwarzer (1996), p. 107) noted that \u201cCoping with an adversity includes innumerous ways of dealing with diverse person-environment transactions. Thus, coping does not represent a homogeneous concept. Instead, it is a diffuse umbrella term.\u201d This line of reasoning is reflected in the Coping Circumplex Model (CCM), which is based on the concept of bipolar problem coping and emotion coping dimensions as well as on the idea of a circular continuum of coping styles. The term \u201ccircumplex\u201d was introduced by Guttman (1954), being derived from the expression \u201ccircular order of complexity.\u201d A circumplex model should meet the following criteria (Gurtman, 1994): (1) Differences between variables are represented by two and only two dimensions; (2) Each variable equidistant from the center of the circle; (3) All variables are uniformly distributed within the hypothetical circle (they are evenly spaced). Furthermore, all possible rotations of the circumplex represent the construct equally well (Larsen and Diener, 1992; Acton and Revelle, 2004). Within a circumplex, variables form a circular continuum with an arbitrary number of constructs.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.1059467345,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

Koch believes the economy is headed into a credit crunch, in part fueled by the rolling banking crisis that continues to unfold. As that lending plays out, Koch thinks it could begin to weigh on the commercial real estate market. \"[Regional banks] have this dual pressure from both deposit outflow and their commercial real estate exposure, and that's going to put pressure on those banks,\" she explained. \"It's going to put pressure on their ability to extend credit, which in turn is going to put pressure on the economy and jobs.

We plan to give select Pixel phones early access later this year.          Since its launch in 2015, Google Photos has used AI to help you get the most out of your memories \u2014 from automatically organizing and resurfacing your photos to helping you edit them with advanced tools like Magic Eraser and Photo Unblur. Today at I\/O, we gave a sneak peek of Magic Editor, a new experimental editing experience that uses generative AI to help you reimagine your photos and make editing even easier. With Magic Editor, you\u2019ll be able to make complex edits without pro-level editing skills. Using a combination of AI techniques, including generative AI, it will help you make edits to specific parts of an image \u2014 like the subject, sky or background \u2014 so you have even more control over the final look and feel of your photo. Sometimes the difference between a so-so picture and the perfect shot comes down to getting the framing just right. Magic Editor will help you improve the overall composition of your photo by allowing you to reposition the subject of your shot to the best spot. For example, if you\u2019re trying to get the perfect photo from your time at a popular waterfall, you could remove the bag strap you forgot to take off. You could also make the sky brighter and less cloudy, so it matches how you remember that day.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.3983299434,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":0,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"inpainting","Noise_20 Document Index":"1","Noise_20 Document":"Masked region and Imagen Editor\u2019s results for \u201ca bouquet of red flowers,\u201d \u201ctwo trees,\u201d \u201can Imagen Editor sign,\u201d \u201ca bush with green leaves,\u201d and \u201ca bush without leaves\u201d Technically called inpainting, the process Google\u2019s new tool uses is like an image restoration or something we can best describe as the confluence of Google AI and Adobe Photoshop\u2019s Content Aware Fill. The researchers developed new encoders for Imagen Editor and also included an object detector module in the AI to compensate for incomplete or inaccurate masks. The research also includes a tool called EditBench to evaluate results of text-guided inpainting. Based on a 240-image dataset, the benchmark evaluated edits on both human-made and AI-generated images on parameters like the modified objects, their attributes like shape, size, number, and suitability for the scene. Google observed that object masking helps improve image-text alignment, making Imagen Editor better than alternatives like DALL-E 2 and StableDiffusion in all the categories EditBench tested. Unfortunately, Google has unspecified concerns related to the responsible use of AI, and that\u2019s why it won\u2019t be releasing Imagen Editor to the public.

Now, Google is sharing research showcasing Imagen Editor, where textual prompts and a little sketching can suffice to perform local edits on photos.

To address this, Google recently shared research for Imagen Editor and EditBench, utilities currently in beta, but capable of guiding edits with text prompts. Instead of creating fresh images using a prompt, Imagen Editor needs a photo that must be edited, a text prompt from the user defining the change, and a masked region defining where the edit needs to be applied.

Apple Vision Pro is Apple's augmented and virtual reality headset, a device that has been in development for more than a decade. Vision Pro marks the company's first entrance into a new product category since the 2015 Apple Watch, with the device introduced at WWDC 2023 in June. A launch is set for early 2024, which means January to late April. While the Apple Vision Pro is definitely a headset, Apple does not use that word when referring to it. Instead, Apple calls it a spatial computer because of its ability to blend digital content with the physical world.  Apple Vision Pro is a mixed reality headset that displays augmented reality content overlaid on world around you, and immersive entirely virtual content, but it's worth noting that the headset is not see through. Everything you see is digital. For augmented reality content that does not make your surroundings disappear, Apple uses cameras that map out what's in front of you, translating that into a digital image augmented by virtual elements.  For a virtual reality experience, Apple shuts off those cameras and can make it seem like you are completely isolated from what's going on around you, allowing you to focus solely on what's being displayed on the headset's screens. This shift between the \"real\" and the \"immersive\" can be controlled with an on-device Digital Crown.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.6666666667,"Cosine Noise_0":0.7481936812,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Apple Vision Pro","Noise_20 Document Index":"4","Noise_20 Document":"3 days ago ...

Amazon said Prime members ordered more than 100 million items from merchants during the Early Access sale. Prime Day, which features deals on many products on Amazon.com, began in 2015 as a celebration of Amazon\u2019s 20th year in business. It turned into a summer sales holiday designed to drum up additional business for Amazon \u2014 and the retailer\u2019s marketplace sellers \u2014 before the holiday shopping season. In recent years, other large retailers have offered promotions on their own websites around Prime Day to take advantage of the additional online shoppers. Amazon Prime Day takes place in more than 20 countries, including: Digital Commerce 360 estimates Amazon\u2019s sales on Prime Day hit $12.09 billion globally during the manufactured retail holiday, which spanned July 12 and 13. That\u2019s up 8.1% year over year from the same shopping spree in 2021, which ran from June 21 through 22. In 2021, Prime Day sales reached $11.19 billion and represented a 7.7% increase over Amazon\u2019s 2020 event.   Prime Day 2021 fell less than a year after the 2020 sales event, which contributed to the slowdown in growth from 45.1% earlier in the pandemic.
