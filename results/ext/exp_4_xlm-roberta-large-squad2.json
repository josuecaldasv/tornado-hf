In support of boycotts of the HFPA by various media companies, actors, and other creatives over its lack of action to increase the membership diversity of the organization, the Golden Globes' regular broadcaster NBC declined to televise the 79th Golden Globe Awards.

The films Belfast and The Power of the Dog were tied for the most nominations, at seven each. The latter tied with Steven Spielberg's West Side Story and HBO's drama Succession with the most awards of the night, with three each.

Intended to resemble ordinary eyeglasses and for a 2024 release, it was canceled in early 2023.  Following the highly publicized failure of Google Glass smartglasses in 2013, Google executives were initially disinclined to re-enter the field of wearable AR technology. However, by 2021, work had begun on a new AR headset, later reported to be codenamed Project Iris. After going through numerous iterations, Google unveiled a version of Iris at the 2022 Google I\/O keynote before publicly testing prototype models later that year. The following year, Google was reported to have abandoned the project in the midst of company-wide layoffs and internal turmoil.

Additionally, in the first three days of its launch, Lost Ark gained over 4.7 million new registered players in the West. Original story: Following its official free-to-play launch on February 11, Lost Ark has already become Steam's second most-played game of all time by concurrent players with an all-time peak of 1,325,305 people. As revealed by SteamDB, Lost Ark passed Counter-Strike: Global Offensive's all-time peak of 1,308,963 players to secure the #2 spot. Considering these all-time peaks tend to happen around a game's release, it may be quite an uphill battle to take down PUBG's record of 3,257,248 players at one time. That aside, it's an impressive feat for the MMO that is developed by Smilegate and Tripod Studio and published by Amazon Game Studios. This accomplishment shouldn't come as too much of a surprise as Lost Ark had already become one of Steam's biggest-ever games before it even went free-to-play.  As with many MMOs or online games, there were some server issues as millions of players attempted to play Lost Ark at once.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.6666666667,"Cosine Noise_100":0.7819951177,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

But Apple didn't detail how much faster it is than last year's A15, and it's not likely to major a big speed boost. The A16 Bionic, built on a 4-nanometer process, sports a faster design with six CPU cores -- the same combination of two powerful and four efficient cores Apple has used for years. Apple didn't say how much faster the A16's high-performance cores are compared with those on the A15, but they use 20% less power, which helps battery life. For the four efficiency cores, Apple didn't offer any comparisons to the A15. \"I think the A16 is very incremental over the A15,\" said\u00a0Anshel Sag, an analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy. Instead of processor speed, Apple \"focused explicitly on camera performance and battery life.\" Without big manufacturing process improvements that shrink transistors, the core data processing circuitry on a chip, designers have a harder time adding features that increase the transistor total.

The slap was in response to Rock's joke about Smith's wife Jada Pinkett Smith's shaved head, which she had been shaving since 2021 due to alopecia areata. Smith returned to his seat and shouted profanity at Rock, who briefly responded, but completed his presentation without further interruption.  Later that evening, Smith won Best Actor and apologized to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and other nominees, but not to Rock, in his acceptance speech. The next day, he issued an apology to Rock and the Academy through social media. Smith resigned his Academy membership on April 1, facing a potential suspension or expulsion, and was banned from attending Academy events for 10 years, effective April 8.  Live television broadcasts in the United States mostly muted the incident due to federal censorship laws.

It is the second generation of ARM architecture intended for Apple's Mac computers after switching from Intel Core to Apple silicon, succeeding the M1. Apple announced the M2 on June 6, 2022, at WWDC, along with models of the MacBook Air and the 13-inch MacBook Pro using the M2. The M2 is made with TSMC's \"Enhanced 5-nanometer technology\" N5P process and contains 20 billion transistors, a 25% increase from the M1. Apple claims CPU improvements up to 18% and GPU improvements up to 35% compared to the M1.[3]  The M2 was followed by the professional-focused M2 Pro and M2 Max chips in January 2023. The M2 Max is a higher-powered version of the M2 Pro, with more GPU cores and memory bandwidth, and a larger die size.[4] Apple introduced the M2 Ultra in June 2023, combining two M2 Max chips in one package.[1]","Jaccard Noise_0":0.6666666667,"Cosine Noise_0":0.8112046719,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Summer 2022.","Noise_20 Document Index":"2","Noise_20 Document":"Trusted Reviews is supported by its audience.

The M2 chip is built upon the new second-generation 5nm architecture, with Apple claiming it offers an 18% CPU performance increase on the existing M1 processor.  But just because this is Apple\u2019s latest chip for Macs, it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the most powerful.

Keep reading on for everything you need to know about the new M2 chip.  The Apple M2 chip debuted inside both the MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro, both of which launched in Summer 2022.  At launch, the cheapest device with the M2 will be the MacBook Air at $1199\/\u00a31249 \u2013 and at that price, you only get an 8-core GPU.

It\u2019s a thrill to read this novel, which punctures, urgently and humanely, the technocrat fantasy that space might save us; it brilliantly vivifies the terrors of love and surveillance and ambition, the dream and impossibility of escape.","Jaccard Noise_60":0.6666666667,"Cosine Noise_60":0.7638559341,"EM Noise_60":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_60":1,"Noise_80 Predicted Answer":"March 29, 2022","Noise_80 Document Index":"6","Noise_80 Document":"First published March 29, 2022 ...

It's all part of the chaotic saga that began this spring, when Musk first put in motion a plan to take control of the social media platform.  Here\u2019s a complete timeline of what\u2019s happened so far. On April 5, Musk discloses he has purchased more than 9% of Twitter's shares on the open market. At first, he is offered a board seat. That plan quickly falls through \u2014\u00a0and Twitter decides to adopt a poison-pill strategy to fend off a hostile takeover from Musk. Musk subsequently makes an offer to buy Twitter for $54.20 a share, or about $44 billion \u2014 a price well above the company's stock price at the time. He says his goal is to apply free speech principles to the platform, which he claimed had been mismanaged.\u00a0\"The company will neither thrive nor serve this societal imperative in its current form,\" he writes. \"Twitter needs to be transformed as a private company.\" \"Twitter has extraordinary potential.

Musk had begun buying shares of the company in January 2022, becoming its largest shareholder by April with a 9.1\u00a0percent ownership stake. Twitter invited Musk to join its board of directors, an offer he initially accepted before declining. On April 14, Musk made an unsolicited offer to purchase the company, to which Twitter's board initially responded with a \"poison pill\" strategy to resist a hostile takeover, before unanimously accepting Musk's buyout offer of $44\u00a0billion on April 25. Musk stated that he planned to introduce new features to the platform, make its algorithms open-source, combat spambot accounts, and promote free speech.  In July, Musk announced his intention to terminate the agreement, asserting that Twitter had breached their agreement by refusing to crack down on spambot accounts. The company filed a lawsuit against Musk in the Delaware Court of Chancery shortly thereafter, with a trial scheduled for the week of October 17. Weeks before the trial was set to begin, Musk reversed course, announcing that he would move forward with the acquisition. The deal was closed on October 27, with Musk immediately becoming Twitter's new owner and CEO.

Arguably the most anticipated Grand Slam on the tennis calendar, the Melbourne tournament has everything and this year won't be different. Ranging from interactive activities to some of the biggest names in the world, the Australian Open doesn't disappoint. Looking back, the 2022 event was nothing short of outstanding. Australian Ash Barty broke a 44-year-old record to claim her first Grand Slam on her home turf. While Rafael Nadal - who notched his 21st Grand Slam - remarkably came back from two sets to love to defeat 2021 US Open (tournament before Aus Open) champion Daniil Medvedev. Here's how it played out. Barty came into the tournament ranked no.1 in the world and knew what it took to win a Grand Slam. Having previously won at Wimbledon (2021) and the French Open (2019), the Queenslander wanted to take home the prize that meant the most: a trophy on her home soil. Despite the pressure of expectation to take out the 2022 championship, Barty's form never wavered throughout the two weeks, resulting in no sets lost. In the final, the Australian came up against American, Danielle Collins, who she had the reign over in previous battles.","Jaccard Noise_80":1.0,"Cosine Noise_80":1.0,"EM Noise_80":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":1,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"Nadal","Noise_100 Document Index":"7","Noise_100 Document":"Even in her loss to Gauff in Auckland, Kenin looked strong.

It would be very exciting to see Korda insert himself among the younger set of men who dominated play at last year's US Open. Shriver: Taylor Fritz has a good chance to be first American men's winner of a major for 20 years. He has played a lot of tennis without much of an offseason, but I hear that after Australia he will take a break. Winning his first major would make the break extra sweet! I need to disclose a conflict: I have joined Donna Vekic's team as an advisory coach. Here in Melbourne, it happens she is on the other side from Swiatek, has a good draw and is playing well. After watching her win six matches in a row in San Diego and knowing how well she has prepared while having a wonderful team around her, Vekic is my outside women's pick. Stubbs: Stan Wawrinka.

Tall and slim in build and impeccable in dress, Mr. Hatch had a gentlemanly demeanor but behind it wielded strong views, high energy and a love for legislative give-and-take that made him a force on Capitol Hill. When he retired in 2019, at the end of his seventh term, he chaired the powerful tax-writing Finance Committee and by virtue of his seniority was Senate president pro tempore. By the end of his tenure, Mr. Hatch had sponsored or co-sponsored 790 pieces of legislation that became law, more than any other senator in office at the time, according to Library of Congress data. He achieved that record in part through his willingness to work with liberal Democrats. \u201cHe was a tough partisan, a solid conservative, but he could make strategic alliances to get legislation passed,\u201d former Senate historian Donald Ritchie said in an interview. \u201cNo one questioned his ideology, so he could deal.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.6666666667,"Cosine Noise_100":0.805213809,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

While its aperture is slightly \u2018slower\u2019 (that is, smaller) the larger sensor compensates. How does the sensor and lens change stack up in practice? The iPhone 14 Pro easily outperforms the previous iPhone, creating far sharper shots: In multiple shots in various conditions, the shots were far more detailed and exhibited less visible processing than comparable iPhone 13 Pro shots: A nice side benefit of a larger sensor is a bit more shallow depth of field.

The main camera\u2019s sensor can optimize for light capture and group every four pixels into a larger quad-pixel (resulting in 12MP shots) or use each pixel individually to optimize for detail in higher-resolution 48MP pics.\u00a0 It\u2019s the latter scenario that I was interested in for this comparison, which shows what happens when you use the ProRAW format and shoot full 48MP photos.

While we can dedicate an entire post to the details of camera sensors, allow me to briefly explain the benefits. Apple has a few main desires when it comes to its camera. Resolution was not the only reason to move to a more advanced, larger and higher pixel-count sensor. Apple desires speed, low noise, light gathering ability, dynamic range (that is, detail in both shadow and light areas) and many more things from this sensor.

What matters is how the camera truly performs when used. This year is a bit different.

Xenoblade Chronicles 3 depicts the futures of the worlds featured in Xenoblade Chronicles (2010) and Xenoblade Chronicles 2 (2017) and concludes the trilogy's narrative.   The development team wanted to develop a story-driven game in the style of the first two entries in the series, while featuring content and combat from previous Xeno entries. The gameplay combines elements from the first and second entries. Like the first two entries, the game was localized by Nintendo of Europe.    Xenoblade Chronicles 3 takes place in Aionios, where two warring nations, Keves and Agnus, engage in perpetual war fought by soldiers with ten-year lifespans.  The story follows Noah and his two childhood friends, Eunie and Lanz, who are from Keves, and Mio and her two fellow servicemen, Sena and Taion, who are from Agnus. They gain the power of Ouroboros and decide to cooperate to find safety.

It is based on the true story of Richmond High School basketball coach Ken Carter, who made headlines in 1999 for suspending his undefeated high school basketball team due to poor academic results.[2][3][4] The story was conceived from a screenplay co-written by John Gatins and Mark Schwahn. The ensemble cast features Rob Brown, Channing Tatum, Debbi Morgan, Robert Ri'chard and singer Ashanti.  The film was a co-production between the motion picture studios of MTV Films and Tollin\/Robbins Productions. Theatrically and for the home video rental market, it was commercially distributed by Paramount Pictures. The film explores professional ethics, academics and athletics.[5] The sports action in the film was coordinated by Mark Ellis. On January 11, the film's soundtrack was released by Capitol Records. The film's score was composed and orchestrated by musician Trevor Rabin.  Coach Carter was released in the United States on January 14, 2005. The film received generally positive reviews and went on to gross $76 million worldwide.  Ken Carter lives in Richmond, California.

Jackson made news last week by refusing to co-star with 50 Cent in a movie based on the rapper's life. He not only refused, but did it publicly, even though the film is to be directed by six-time Oscar nominee Jim Sheridan (\"In America\"). A clue to Jackson's thinking may be found in his new film, \"Coach Carter,\" based on the true story of a California high school basketball coach who placed grades ahead of sports. Like Bill Cosby, Jackson is arguing against the anti-intellectual message that success for young black males is better sought in the worlds of rap and sports than in the classroom. There is however another aspect to Jackson's refusal: He said he thought Sheridan wanted him to \"lend legitimacy\" to 50 Cent's acting debut. He might have something there. Jackson has an authority on the screen; he occupies a character with compelling force, commanding attention and can bring class to a movie. He might, he said, be interested in working with 50 Cent after the rapper makes another five movies or so, and earns his chops. This reasoning may not be fair. Consider the work that Ice Cube did in \"Boyz N the Hood\" (1991), his first movie and the beginning of a successful acting career.

However, the feature hasn\u2019t lived up to its name so far. It has been in beta for two years now, and it is still far from self-driving. Technically, the system is able to both activate and attempt to drive in most areas, including across intersections, but the responsibility remains with the driver, who needs to be paying attention at all times and be ready to take control. Many see the willingness to take responsibility for the system as the most important step companies developing self-driving systems can take toward achieving this goal. Tesla has made it clear that it is not there yet and participating in the FSD Beta comes with a bunch of warnings that make it clear the responsibility is still with the driver. But Tesla sees every new FSD update as a step closer to the goal, and it believes that some of those updates even warrant price increases for the package.

The club was founded in 1970 and currently plays in Ligue 1, the first division of French football. Toulouse plays its home matches at the Stadium de Toulouse located within the city.  Les Pitchouns are the current holders of the Coupe de France, and have won the second tier Ligue 2 on three occasions.[2] Toulouse have participated in European competition five times, including in 2007 when they qualified for the UEFA Champions League for the first time.[3] They are set to participate in the 2023\u201324 UEFA Europa League, following their victory in the preceding year's Coupe de France.   The president of Toulouse FC is Damien Comolli, who succeeded the French businessman Olivier Sadran who took over the club following its bankruptcy in 2001 which resulted in it being relegated to the Championnat National. The club has served as a springboard for several players, most notably the World Cup-winning goalkeeper Fabien Barthez, international strikers Andr\u00e9-Pierre Gignac[4] and Martin Braithwaite.

Any club suspected of fixing just one game since a UEFA rule took effect in 2007 is typically removed from the next European competition. A disciplinary case also is opened that can apply further sanctions. Turkish club Fenerbahce ended up missing three seasons because of fixing allegations in 2011. Milan and Toulouse, owned by RedBird Capital Partners, are not alone facing UEFA questions about multi-club owners having \u201cdecisive influence\u201d over two clubs. Brighton and Union Saint-Gilloise have close ties through owner Tony Bloom and both are in the Europa League. Aston Villa\u2019s owners, including Milwaukee Bucks co-owner Wes Edens, have a near-50% stake in Vit\u00f3ria Guimar\u00e3es of Portugal. Both are in the Europa Conference League.

The escape, first reported by The San Diego Union-Tribune, comes just three weeks before his sentencing.

Francis, a Malaysian national and the former president of Singapore-based Glenn Defense Marine Asia, was convicted in 2015 after taking a plea deal in exchange for helping U.S. prosecutors implicate three-dozen military officials. Since at least 2018, he has been living in home detention in San Diego under court-approved \u201cmedical furloughs\u201d for treatment of renal cancer and other health issues, according to federal court documents. He was scheduled to be sentenced on Sept. 22 before District Court Judge Janis Sammartino.

He is due to be extradited back to the US. Francis escaped house detention just weeks before he was due to face sentencing for his crimes. In 2015, he had admitted to bribery and corruption charges and had been a co-operative witness for prosecutors. Authorities had allowed him to be detained at home in San Diego because he had suffered bouts of poor health in recent years, including kidney cancer.  However on 4 September, police went to his house after problems with his GPS bracelet were detected. \"Upon arrival they noticed that nobody was home,\" a US Marshal spokesman Omar Castillo told reporters at the time. Neighbours said removal trucks had come in and out of the property in recent weeks, he added.

With Francis\u2019s help, prosecutors secured convictions of 33 of 34 defendants. Francis increasingly took advantage of his confinement rules, according to new records on his household arrangements obtained by The Washington Post and interviews with people who knew or worked for him during his years in home detention. He hired servants to meet his family\u2019s every need and undermined the court\u2019s security requirements aimed at keeping him from fleeing  by stationing his personal security guards in windowless garages, with no night patrols and no visitor\u2019s logs. He seemed able to anticipate when federal officers were headed to check on him, the interviews showed, and allowed a video crew to film him days before he fled. During his  years on medical furlough, Francis stayed at three private homes, where his comforts and liberties grew.

The fine was partly based on the fact Instagram had allowed children to operate business accounts on its platform. Instagram business accounts show the account holder's phone number and email address, meaning that data was exposed.

However, what if there was a Batman show without Batman? One where Batman can no longer protect Gotham City from its dozens of supervillains? That's the question that The CW, the channel responsible for the successful Arrowverse, hopes to answer with Gotham Knights (2023). Not to be confused with the 2022 videogame of the same name which has a similar but unrelated premise, Gotham Knights takes place in a world where Bruce Wayne is mysteriously murdered while on one of his crime-stopping missions, leaving his adopted son Turner (Oscar Morgan) to pick up the pieces while also being accused of his father's murder. Now, Turner must form a new crime-fighting team to fill the bat-shaped void apparent within Gotham. Arguably the most famous superhero of all time, Batman is best known for his prolific roles in various DC Comics and a multitude of feature film adaptations.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.4072549939,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

The multi-time NASCAR Cup Series champion will join Richard Childress Racing in 2023, according to a report from Jordan Bianchi of The Athletic. The move ends a successful 15-year tenure with Joe Gibbs Racing. An official announcement is expected Tuesday, per the report. The news punctuates an eventful and \u201cstressful\u201d regular season for Busch, whose free agency dominated headlines and clouded a playoff-caliber season in 2022. It did so because his looming free agency revealed a strange reality in NASCAR economics \u2014 that one of the sport\u2019s biggest stars would have to struggle to find a home (even with taking a pay cut) because of something outside of his control. That \u201csomething\u201d outside of his control, in this case, was the result of the Mars Inc. decision to exit NASCAR at the end of the year, leaving Joe Gibbs Racing (Busch\u2019s current team) without a primary sponsor for Busch\u2019s No. 18 team. Busch confirmed to reporters earlier this month that he had \u201cmore than one\u201d team extend official contract offers to him. RCR was among those companies, per reports at the time. He also said that his uncertain future had been weighing on him. \u201cIt weighs on you every time, every day of the week,\u201d Busch said at NASCAR\u2019s playoff media day before the race at Darlington.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":1.0000001192,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Richard Childress Racing","Noise_20 Document Index":"4","Noise_20 Document":"In 2011, Richard Childress punched Kyle Busch and pit him in a headlock following a NASCAR Camping World Truck Series race at Kansas.

The two-time Nascar Cup Series champion is officially a driver for Richard Childress Racing, as he will take over the No. 8 Chevrolet in 2023. The move is a serious blow to Toyota, which invested in Busch when he joined the OEM in 2008 as a hot-headed young gun. No matter what trouble Busch got himself into, Toyota and Mars Wrigley \u2014 his primary sponsor until 2022 \u2014 always had his back. Two championships and dozens of wins later, Busch was waiting for JGR to sign a new primary sponsor and then have a contract extension of his own.

The two-time NASCAR Cup Series champion will leave Joe Gibbs Racing after a 15-year tenure that saw Busch become one of the greatest drivers of his generation as well as one of the greatest in NASCAR history, earning 56 of his 60 career victories behind the wheel of a Gibbs Toyota. Busch's departure comes after a protracted contract situation that could not be resolved, as Joe Gibbs Racing was unable to find a sponsor capable of replacing the departing Mars Inc. and meeting Busch's salary demands. Busch is expected to be replaced behind the wheel of the No. 18 Toyota by Ty Gibbs, the 19-year old grandson of Joe Gibbs and a star in the NASCAR Xfinity Series.

You might have just figured this out by watching the season 4 premiere, which is aptly titled \u201cLex Luthor\u201d, but it was actually announced back in September during a preview on EW.

The show has been setting up Luthor\u2019s arrival since season two when Conner\/Superboy (played by Joshua Orpin) debuted in Titans. Superboy is a clone of both Clark Kent and Lex Luthor in Titans, and season 4 will explore the character\u2019s dark side. Titus Welliver is likely to play a major role in Titans season 4 as Lex Luthor, and taking on a fan-favorite antagonist comes with a big responsibility. Fans can get really picky nowadays, and Lex Luthor has been a major source of controversy for the past few years. Almost no one liked Jesse Eisenberg\u2019s young, temperamental version of Luthor, but Welliver at least is older and bears a resemblance to the character. However, he will be sporting a beard akin to Jon Cryer\u2019s iteration in the Arrowverse. You can check out the first look at Welliver as Lex Luthor below (courtesy of Entertainment Weekly).

So we can\u2019t ignore the significance of cloud cybersecurity moving forward as we continue to go completely digital in so many aspects of our lives. Cybersecurity companies are fighting for market share as data breaches and ransomware attacks become more common, more damaging and more expensive. With many companies turning towards cloud technology, it\u2019s no secret that companies like Google, Amazon and Microsoft are going to increase focus on this business sector. That said, Google\u2019s recent acquisition of the cyber security company, Mandiant, has stirred up a lot of conversation about the future of cloud cybersecurity and the highly competitive landscape therein. We\u2019re going to look at this space to see how much money the big players are making. It was announced on September 12 that Google\u2019s $5.4 billion bid to acquire the cybersecurity firm Mandiant was completed. Mandiant will be joining Google\u2019s cloud computing division so Google can attempt to compete with Amazon\u2019s AWS and Microsoft\u2019s Azure. This is Google\u2019s second-largest acquisition as the company aims to focus on enhancing its security operations suite and advisory services.

ROME \u2014 Giorgia Meloni has been named Italy\u2019s first female prime minister at the head of a right-wing government, after holding talks with the country\u2019s president.  After a week of infighting which overshadowed the negotiations, Meloni\u2019s warring coalition put forward a united front, backing Meloni to lead the country during formal talks with President Sergio Mattarella, on Friday.

Abe died from excessive bleeding and was pronounced dead at 5:03 p.m. local time, doctors at the Nara Medical University hospital said during a news conference on Friday. The doctors said the bullet that killed the former Japanese leader was \u201cdeep enough to reach his heart\u201d and a team of 20 medical professionals were unable to stop the bleeding.           Abe went into cardiopulmonary arrest at the site of the shooting and was rushed to hospital in a state of cardiac arrest at 12:20 p.m. local time, doctors said. During surgery, doctors discovered a gunshot wound to his neck and a large wound on his heart.

But as they mourned, thousands of others took to the streets in anti-funeral protests across Tokyo, illustrating a deep public divide over the occasion, Japan\u2019s first state funeral for a Japanese leader since 1967.           Some crowds chanted slogans as they marched near the funeral venue, waving banners that urged a stop to the proceedings. Protest leaders rallied the crowd through loudspeakers, and a van rolled past with music blasting from a boom box.            The protests grew tense at times, with several loud confrontations and scuffles between demonstrators and police.           Abe\u2019s death sent shock waves through Japan and the international community, with thousands of mourners gathering in Tokyo in July as his private funeral took place. But in the months since his assassination, the outpouring of grief has given way to a growing discontent.            Abe\u2019s state funeral comes as the country grapples with rising inflation and anger stemming from revelations that half of Japan\u2019s ruling party members had ties with the controversial Unification Church which has faced backlash over fundraising practices.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.1677386761,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

Below, we\u2019ve captured some of that email:  For those of us on the old legacy $14.99 price, this is quite the jump. An extra $8 per month is likely still worth it for most of us, since YouTube ads are the worst and the subscription includes YouTube Music, but I can also see why many might look to cut off subscriptions.

The story seems to pick up shortly after its predecessor leaves off, with Kratos and Atreus asking all the same questions fans have been wondering about since that cliffhanger finale. Here's everything you need to know about God of War Ragnar\u00f6k. Kratos and Atreus will continue their adventure in 'God of War Ragnarok.' After getting pushed back from an original release window of 2021, and a long time waiting, the official release date for God of War Ragnar\u00f6k is November 9, 2022. The announcement was made on the PlayStation blog along with a snazzy new trailer. As happy as many people are to see the game finally get an official release, it comes after a wave of intense harassment that the developers at Sony Santa Monica faced. Some developers even shared that they were being sent unsolicited Dick Pics due to the game not revealing a release date.  Yes, Sony Santa Monica revealed a three-minute trailer that goes into quite a bit of detail about the story of God of War Ragnar\u00f6k.

GoW: Ragnarok was released on November 9, 2022, and was positively received by critics and the gaming community. It is safe to say it lived up to the hype and exceeded expectations. But, since it\u2019s a Sony-exclusive title, God of War: Ragnarok was only released on the PlayStation 4 and 5. However, the first installment to this beloved franchise got the opportunity to be ported for PC gamers after four years since it was conceived. This leaves us with the question \u2013 When will God of War: Ragnarok come to PC? Plus, what are God of War: Ragnarok\u2019s basic PC requirements so my computer can run smoothly? We will answer all of that for you in this article. Please enable JavaScript God of War was released for PlayStation 4 on August 20, 2018. It was until January 14, 2022, that fans of Kratos were able to embark on his epic God-slaying adventures on PC.

The era of huge budgets and endless hubris came to an end as the rent came due all at once. In spring and summer, Netflix, the leader in the space, hemorrhaged users for the first time in ten years, prompting a stock swoon, a swath of layoffs, and a moratorium on the blank checks the company used to dole out to Hollywood needle movers. (Sorry, Bright 2, we hardly knew you.) Plenty of analysts have tried to evaluate exactly what went wrong, and most lay the blame on a combination of a middling slate of original programming and a newfound national stinginess in the face of rising inflation. Thankfully, Netflix has humbled itself to address at least one of those issues with a new payment plan it put into action this autumn. For a teensy $6.99 per month, anyone can pay for a Netflix subscription \u2026 as long as they\u2019re willing to sit through a few commercials during playback.

Democrats have retained\u00a0control of the Senate after vulnerable incumbents in Arizona and Nevada won reelection and a seat flipped in Pennsylvania. They also have a chance to grow their slim majority as a Georgia Senate race heads to a run-off next month. Controlling the House will allow Republicans to open congressional investigations into perceived wrongdoings by their rivals, including foreign business dealings by the president\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, an issue Democrats dismiss as unfounded. A Republican House will also almost certainly disband the panel investigating the riot at the Capitol on January 6, 2021, when former President Donald Trump\u2019s supporters ransacked the building in a failed effort to prevent the certification of Biden\u2019s electoral victory. Civil rights advocates also fear that far-right Republican legislators accused of stoking bigotry and undermining the democratic system, including Congresswoman Majorie Taylor Greene, may be given leadership positions in the new Congress. But without the Senate, Republicans will not be able to pass their own legislation without Democrats\u2019 help. Moreover, the president can veto bills approved by Congress. Politicians can override the veto by a two-thirds majority in each chamber.

Still, nothing becomes law without Biden\u2019s signature. Bills to fund the government, raise the debt ceiling and deal with military issues are necessary for government to function. Those bills are likely to become flashpoints in negotiations between the GOP, Democrats and the White House.  Biden, who served in the Senate for decades, has often touted his bipartisan credentials and said he wants to work with Republicans. But there would be little appetite for that in a GOP Congress that has made opposition to Biden its top priority.  While the Senate could tilt either way after the midterm elections, the majority party is still likely to have the slimmest of margins. That means Biden will be able to find a bit more common ground there, no matter who is in charge. Much of Biden\u2019s legislative achievements in office have been the byproduct of bipartisan negotiations in the Senate.  Still, a Republican-led Senate could pass bills sent over by a GOP House, putting political pressure on Biden. And the GOP would regain control of committees and, with it, the power to conduct investigations and oversight of the administration. A Republican Senate could also make life difficult for Biden by blocking or delaying passage of the president\u2019s judicial and executive branch nominees.

However, turnout during the Trump administration was high, particularly in the 2018 midterm election, which gave Nancy Pelosi her second stint as Speaker of the House. But because the stakes of the midterms were high this year, we saw more people turning up to the booths. After the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, Democrats used abortion rights to win special elections in places like New York\u2019s Hudson Valley, in addition to flipping Alaska\u2019s lone House seat. Republicans, on the other hand, pointed to high inflation rates, government spending, and crime rates, which ultimately drove many voters to cast their ballots for the GOP.

Midterm elections historically hurt the president\u2019s party. In 18 of the last 20 elections the president\u2019s party lost ground in the House. Redistricting played a significant role in the 2022 House elections. New lines altered the competitiveness in numerous districts, and some incumbents ran for re-election in the new territory. After the 2020 Census, state legislatures or commissions drew congressional district lines. Both parties filed lawsuits to challenge these new maps. Republicans controlled line-drawing in far more districts than Democrats and, as a result, gained more seats in the House from redistricting alone. Midterms are generally viewed as a referendum on the president. With low approval ratings and high inflation, the Biden administration\u2019s politics, policies, and polling shaped the national atmosphere. The results of the 2022 midterms held true to form, with the opposing party gaining House majority.

The British press referred to Martha as the \"first ethnic minority companion in the 43-year television history of Doctor Who\"[5]  despite the presence of Mickey Smith in the previous series\u2014including several episodes in which he travelled in the TARDIS with the Doctor.

{"Query":"What is the title of the new season of \"Criminal Minds\"?","Correct Answer":["Evolution"],"Noise_0 Predicted Answer":"Criminal Minds: Evolution","Noise_0 Document Index":"0","Noise_0 Document":"The Criminal Minds reboot on Paramount+ gets a brand new title which effectively resolves one of the biggest problems of the upcoming series.  The Criminal Minds reboot's new title - Criminal Minds: Evolution - resolves one of its biggest problems. Paramount+ is bringing back FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit (BAU) to the small screen not long after the team wrapped up its run on CBS for 15 years. While the profilers will miss a couple of their co-workers such as Matthew Gray Gubler's Spencer Reid and Daniel Henney's Matt Simmons, the rest of the squad will be intact as they track down a network of UnSubs which was established during the coronavirus pandemic. Many aspects of the original Criminal Minds run will stay the same, but Evolutions has some fresh aspects, including a new title. Retitling Paramount+'s Criminal Minds revival as Criminal Minds: Evolution is appropriate given this new version of the show. The project is a continuation of its CBS run, so technically, it isn't really a \"reboot\" as it has usually been referred to. The cast remains the same and its events take place in the same continuity. Instead of calling it Criminal Minds season 16, however, giving it a different title allows it to separate itself from the CBS procedural without totally severing its ties with it. It also hints that everything in Criminal Minds: Evolution is an evolved version of the original show, which seems to be the case.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.3333333333,"Cosine Noise_0":0.3522495031,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Criminal Minds: Evolution","Noise_20 Document Index":"2","Noise_20 Document":"'Grease: Rise Of The Pink Ladies' Gets VOD & DVD Release After Cancellation & Paramount+ Removal\t\t \t\t\t        Gilford will play Elias Voit, an operations analyst for a global cyber-security firm who has a dark side and obsession with death.

It has been a while since the profilers' last on-screen case, but the characters' stories continued during that period. Granted that revival retcons the Criminal Minds finale in several ways, it's essentially the same thing. That being said, Paramount+ just cannot simply use the title Criminal Minds season 16 because the project is different in a couple of significant ways from its original run. That includes veering away from its episodic storytelling format to a more serialized one, not to mention being darker and more disturbing than CBS' iteration. By giving the Criminal Minds revival a new title, Paramount+ allows it to be both a reboot and a continuation of the CBS series. Calling it Criminal Minds season 16 could also be confusing if the project doesn\u2019t address every single plot line that the finale left loose, which puts a lot of burden on the new series. Having its official title of Criminal Minds: Evolution quickly establishes that the show is part of the Criminal Minds brand, which could entice some formers fans to check it out, especially those who haven\u2019t been keeping track of Paramount+\u2019s efforts to bring back the BAU on the small screen.

It wanted a former college athlete, an exec passionate about higher education, an established corporate leader and a savvy politician who knows how to get things done in government. The governing body found all of those traits and more in Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker, a former Harvard basketball athlete and avid sports fan. The NCAA announced today that it has selected the two-term governor to be its next president. Baker will replace outgoing NCAA President Mark Emmert starting March 1. His second term as governor is slated to conclude Jan. 5; he announced about a year ago that he wouldn\u2019t seek a third term. Emmert will stay on as an adviser through June. The NCAA\u2019s choice of Baker, 66, signifies the association\u2019s desire to have a leader who is well-versed in the ways that Washington, D.C., works. With the NCAA facing so many legal and legislative challenges, the board of governors, who made the hire, focused on someone from the political arena early in the process and Baker emerged as the candidate with the experience and expertise to navigate the governmental and athletic worlds that often collide in college sports. When asked why he wanted the job, Baker replied, \u201cBecause it\u2019s worth doing.

Finding the next NCAA president will not be easy. One athletic director told ESPN: \"The big question is, 'Who would really want that job?' My question is, 'Do they bring someone in for 2-3 years that's trusted to get everyone through the choppy waters? Or do they go long term?'\" A short-term option could be someone like former Big 12 commissioner Bob Bowlsby or former NCAA executive Oliver Luck. They both know how thankless the job is, but they also still are true believers in college athletics. A popular internal option would be Dan Gavitt, the NCAA's senior vice president of basketball who is the association's most respected employee. The NCAA could also continue to go the route of college presidents, which has been the prior model the past two full-time presidents -- Myles Brand and Emmert.

Del Toro has used the platform afforded by his nominations to champion the medium of animation as true cinema, proclaiming in his Bafta award speech:  Animation is not a genre for kids. It\u2019s a medium for art, it\u2019s a medium for film and I think animation should stay in the conversation. His rendition of Pinocchio has certainly started a conversation, not least in gaining an impressive audience on Netflix.

Now trailing 38-33, Georgia attempted a two-point conversion so they could potentially tie the game with a field goal. Bennett completed the pass to McConkey running an out route at the 1 yard line, and McConkey got past the goal line to give Georgia two points and make the score 38-35 in favor of Ohio State.  Ohio State then went on a methodical drive which used 5:58 of game clock. Stroud got into Georgia territory on a 17 yard scramble, and the Buckeyes made it to the Georgia 18 before Jamon Dumas-Johnson forced them back to the 30 with a sack of Stroud. Stroud's pass on third and long was incomplete, and Ruggles was sent to kick a 48 yard field goal, a career long for him. The kick was good, giving Ohio State a 41-35 lead with 2:43 remaining in the game.  Jackson returned Fielding's kickoff to the Georgia 28.

By the end of 2023, Zack Snyder will be back behind the camera for Rebel Moon. The fan-favorite director will test his skills in an epic space opera heading to Netflix later this year. Here\u2019s all the information we know about the Rebel Moon release date. Netflix set the Rebel Moon release date for December 22, 2023. One of the most-anticipated movies in 2023, Rebel Moon was penned by Snyder, Shay Hatten, and Kurt Johnstad. Snyder has directed many movies that can be labeled as sci-fi, proof is his long commitment to the DC Universe superheroes in what was nicknamed the \u201cSnyderverse.\u201d However, Space Moon will be his first space opera. The 57-year-old director started his partnership with Netflix with 2021\u2019s Army of the Dead, a zombie movie that featured an epic heist.  Inspired by Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa and Star Wars, Rebel Moon follows a peaceful colony dealing with an oppressive regent. Still, many details are under wrap, and the movie hasn\u2019t even got a trailer. Yet, Netflix believes so very much in the Rebel Moon potential of the film that a sequel is being filmed back-to-back. Originally, Snyder approached Lucasfilm with his story, but the project never sailed there. Instead, it took the current form after the involvement of producer Eric Newman.","Jaccard Noise_40":0.6666666667,"Cosine Noise_40":0.841422081,"EM Noise_40":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":1,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"Dec. 22","Noise_60 Document Index":"3","Noise_60 Document":"Inspired by the classic 1954 Akira Kurosawa film\u00a0Seven Samurai,\u00a0Rebel Moon is a big-canvas ballad of galactic resistance as only Snyder could portray it.

{"Query":"What is the title of the AI-generated episode of Seinfeld?","Correct Answer":["Nothing, Forever"],"Noise_0 Predicted Answer":"Nothing, Forever","Noise_0 Document Index":"0","Noise_0 Document":"Front page layout Site theme  Benj Edwards     -  Feb 6, 2023 5:10 pm UTC  Since December 14, a Twitch channel called Nothing, Forever has been streaming a live, endless AI-generated Seinfeld episode that features pixelated cartoon versions of characters from the TV show. On Monday, Twitch gave the channel a 14-day ban after language model tools from OpenAI went haywire and generated transphobic content that violated community guidelines. Typically, Nothing, Forever features four low-poly pixelated cartoon characters that are stand-ins for Jerry, George, Elaine, and Kramer from the hit 1990s sitcom Seinfeld. They sit around a New York apartment and talk about life, and sometimes the topics of conversation unexpectedly get deep, such as in this viewer-captured segment where they discussed the afterlife. Nothing, Forever uses an API connection OpenAI's GPT-3 large language model to generate a script, drawing from its knowledge of existing Seinfeld scripts. Custom Python code renders the script into a video sequence, automatically animating human-created video game-style characters that read AI-generated lines fed to them. One of its creators provided more technical details on how it works in a Reddit comment from December. As a new media experiment, the faux-Seinfeld stream often feels awkward and unfunny, but it's still interesting because viewers never know what the characters will talk about next.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":1.0,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"NOTHING, FOREVER","Noise_20 Document Index":"1","Noise_20 Document":"Feb 4, 2023 ...

The novel idea has taken root on the platform, and at time of publication, the stream has roughly 15,400 concurrent viewers.  The content comes at a time when generative AI seems to be cropping up everywhere. Here\u2019s what you need to know about AI Seinfeld on Twitch.  AI Seinfeld is a Twitch stream called \u201cNothing, Forever\u201d that plays AI-generated content based on Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David\u2019s \u201990s comedic sitcom, Seinfeld. The show has been formally running since Dec. 14, but the group behind it, Mismatch Media, just started sharing in the past week. It sports a chunky 3D pixel style that looks a video game, and computerized voices that deliver an endless stream of Seinfeld-esque antics.  Skyler Hartle, a member of Mismatch Media, told Polygon that the stream uses various AI software to bring the show to life. The text generation comes from OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3 models and the speech comes from Azure Cognitive Services.","Jaccard Noise_40":0.0,"Cosine Noise_40":0.9468737841,"EM Noise_40":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":0,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"'Nothing, Forever'","Noise_60 Document Index":"2","Noise_60 Document":"Feb 2, 2023 ...

Also at this time, the use of Jerry's stand-up act slowly declined, and the stand-up segment in the middle of Seinfeld episodes was cut.  Much publicity followed the controversial episode, \"The Contest\", an Emmy Award-winning episode written by David, whose subject matter was considered inappropriate for prime time network TV. To circumvent this taboo, the word \"masturbation\" was never used in the script, instead substituted for by a variety of oblique references.[66] Midway through that season, Seinfeld was moved from its original 9:00\u00a0p.m. time slot on Wednesdays to 9:30\u00a0p.m. on Thursdays, following Cheers again, which gave the show even more popularity. Ratings also sparked the move, as Tim Allen's sitcom Home Improvement on ABC had aired at the same time and Improvement kept beating Seinfeld in the ratings.

Midjourney exists on Discord because \u201cpeople want to make things together\u201d \u201cA lot of people ask us, why don\u2019t you just make an iOS app that makes you a picture?\u201d Midjourney\u2019s founder, David Holz, told The Verge in an interview. \u201cBut people want to make things together, and if you do that on iOS, you have to make your own social network. And that\u2019s pretty hard. So if you want your own social experience, Discord is really great.\u201d Sign up for a free account, and you get 25 credits, with all images generated in public chatrooms. After that, you\u2019ll have to pay \u2014 either $10 or $30 a month, depending on the number of images you want to make and whether or not they\u2019re private to you.  This week, though, Midjourney is expanding access to its model, allowing anyone to create their own Discord server with their own AI image generator.","Jaccard Noise_60":1.0,"Cosine Noise_60":0.9870826602,"EM Noise_60":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_60":1,"Noise_80 Predicted Answer":"Holz","Noise_80 Document Index":"0","Noise_80 Document":"\u201cComing from the IA [intelligence augmentation] school of thought, I\u2019ve always been more interested in empowering people and trying to make people better.\u201d\u00a0 Like many experts in AI who believe in using machines to perform tasks that humans would consider intelligent or smart \u2014and experts in IA, who place humans at the center of the system and use technology to support and complement human cognitive functions, Holz chose a path that would let him enjoy the best of both worlds.\u00a0 \u201cOver the years, I\u2019ve realized that we can use AI to empower people and to make people better and those people can make better AI \u2014 it\u2019s like coming full circle and everyone wins,\u201d he said.\u00a0 Leap Motion transpired out of this ideology.

Bing will now respond to search queries with more detailed answers - not just links to websites.  Users are also able to chat with the bot to better tailor their queries. More contextual answers will be added on the right hand side of a search page. The new Bing search engine will be live right away - with a limited number of searches for each person.  The announcement comes a day after Google revealed details of its own new chatbot, Bard. Both companies are scrambling to get their products to market.  In a note to investors after the announcement, analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities said he thought that Microsoft's investment would \"massively boost\" the firm's ability to compete.","Jaccard Noise_20":0.0,"Cosine Noise_20":0.2634467185,"EM Noise_20":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":0,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"artificial intelligence chat","Noise_40 Document Index":"6","Noise_40 Document":"Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

It is the fourth main installment of the Pikmin series, following Pikmin 3 (2013), and the sixth installment overall.

It introduces two new species of Pikmin called Ice Pikmin and Glow Pikmin, as well as new features like the Night Expeditions, in which players defend against waves of nocturnal enemies. In the story, the player assumes the role of a recently recruited member of the Rescue Corps, a group in need of rescuing following an unsuccessful attempt to save Captain Olimar.  Pikmin 4 received positive reviews from critics, who praised the game's level design, visuals, score, amount of content, and accessibility to newcomers, while criticizing the limited multiplayer options and low difficulty.  The player controls a minuscule character who takes command of squads of Pikmin to explore various areas, fight enemies, secure treasures, and solve puzzles.[2] Pikmin can be directed to perform various tasks, such as carrying objects and fighting enemies, and have individual weaknesses and strengths. For example, Red Pikmin are invulnerable to fire, Blue Pikmin can walk underwater, and Winged Pikmin can lift up objects and float over hazards.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.6666666667,"Cosine Noise_0":0.8181959391,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"July 21, 2023","Noise_20 Document Index":"9","Noise_20 Document":"Jun 28, 2023 ...

Last month, the company said it would buy the primary care provider One Medical in a deal valued roughly at $3.9 billion, a move that expanded its reach further into health care.

The company hasn't had much success with household robots, but the iRobot acquisition and the company's strong market reputation provide a \"massive foothold in the consumer robot market\" that could help Amazon replicate the success of its Echo line of smart speakers, said Lian Jye Su, a robotics industry analyst for ABI Research. Su said it also illustrates the shortcomings of consumer robotics vendors like iRobot, which struggled to expand beyond a niche product and was in a \"race-to-the-bottom\" competition with Korean and Chinese manufacturers offering cheaper versions of a robotic vacuum. On Friday, iRobot reported its quarterly results. Revenue plunged 30% primarily on order reductions and delays, and the company announced it was laying off 10% of its workforce.

LLaMA's developers reported that the 13B parameter model's performance on most NLP benchmarks exceeded that of the much larger GPT-3 (with 175B parameters) and that the largest model was competitive with state of the art models such as PaLM and Chinchilla.[1] Whereas the most powerful LLMs have generally been accessible only through limited APIs (if at all), Meta released LLaMA's model weights to the research community under a noncommercial license.[2] Within a week of LLaMA's release, its weights were leaked to the public on 4chan via BitTorrent.[3]  In July 2023, Meta released several models as Llama 2, using 7, 13 and 70 billion parameters.

LLaMA comes in four size variants: 7B, 13B, 33B, and 65B parameters. The paper shows that training smaller foundation models on large enough tokens is desirable, as it requires less computing power and resources. The 65B parameter models have been trained on 1.4 trillion tokens, while the LLaMA 7B model has been trained on 1 trillion tokens. Just a few weeks after the release of LLaMA, the open-source community embraced it by creating an optimized version and expanding its use cases. Now, you can fine-tune LLaMA using LoRA (reduces the number of trainable parameters for fine-tuning) and train a chatbot with Stanford Alpaca. Lightning AI has also joined the trend by providing an open-source, from-scratch rewrite of LLaMA called Lit-LLaMA. The main highlight of Lit-LLaMA is that it is released under the Apache 2.0 license, which makes it easier to adopt for other deep learning projects that use similar permissive licenses and also enables commercial use.","Jaccard Noise_40":0.5,"Cosine Noise_40":0.7202513218,"EM Noise_40":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":1,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"llama outfitter\u2019s","Noise_60 Document Index":"2","Noise_60 Document":"Advancing health one insight at a time n a trip to Capitol Reef National Park with my son, I wanted to try something different, something exciting, something I\u2019d never done before.\u00a0 So we went on a two-hour llama hike.\u00a0 When Andrew, the guide, arrived with the 350-pound animals, the first thing I thought was how we were supposed to trust these animals not to trample us.

Deploying a machine-learning algorithm, the chatbot scans text across the internet and develops a statistical model that allows it to string words together in response to a given prompt. The technology has stoked controversy over its potential to spread misinformation and hate speech, as well as efforts taken by some designers to moderate responses in order to limit such outcomes. In March, Musk signed onto an open letter with some other industry leaders raising concerns about the potential negative impact of AI and calling for a six-month pause in development of the technology. XAI adds a new company to Musk's portfolio roughly one month after he officially stepped down as Twitter CEO. He retained a prominent role in the company as its executive chairman and chief technology officer. The AI startup will \"work closely\" with Tesla and Twitter but remain separate, according to the new company's website. Musk acknowledged that the new company remains in its infancy. \"XAI is just starting out here,\" he said, adding that he expects it \"to be a while\" before the company's offering reaches a scale on par with products from OpenAI or Google.

The 39-yard passing score energized the crowd and introduced Pop Watson to the fanbase.

Cal joins Cere in storming the base and confronting Trilla, whom Cal defeats. Cere then attempts to reconcile with her former Padawan, but Darth Vader appears and executes Trilla for failing him. Unable to defeat Vader, Cal and Cere barely escape from his grasp and return to the Mantis, where they realize that the children listed on the Holocron will only be in more danger if they become Jedi. Choosing to leave their fates to the will of the Force, Cal destroys the Holocron and prepares for his next adventure with his crew.  Cal returns as the protagonist of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor (2023), set five years after the events of the first game, where he continues his fight against the Empire while being joined by both new and old friends and allies, and making new adversaries.  A young Cal makes a cameo appearance in the novel Star Wars: Brotherhood (2022) by Mike Chen. He is also the main character of the novel Star Wars Jedi: Battle Scars (2023) by Sam Maggs, which is set in-between the events of Jedi: Fallen Order and Jedi: Survivor and bridges the gap between the two games' storylines. In 2023, Cal was added as a playable character to the mobile game Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.5,"Cosine Noise_100":0.771117568,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

Under federal law, Medicaid coverage of COVID-19 vaccinations, testing, and treatment for this group will end when the PHE ends.  Private Health Insurance Vaccines: Most forms of private health insurance must continue to cover COVID-19 vaccines furnished by an in-network health care provider without cost sharing. People with private health insurance may need to pay part of the cost if an out-of-network provider vaccinates them. Testing: After the expected end of the PHE on May 11, 2023, mandatory coverage for over-the-counter and laboratory-based COVID-19 PCR and antigen tests will end, though coverage will vary depending on the health plan. If private insurance chooses to cover these items or services, there may be cost sharing, prior authorization, or other forms of medical management may be \u00a0required.

But many of the Medicaid waivers and flexibilities, including those that support home and community-based services, are available for states to continue beyond the PHE, if they choose to do so. For example, states have used COVID-19 PHE-related flexibilities to increase the number of individuals served under a waiver, expand provider qualifications, and other flexibilities. Many of these options may be extended beyond the PHE. Coverage for COVID-19 testing for Americans will change. Medicare beneficiaries who are enrolled in Part B will continue to have coverage without cost sharing for laboratory-conducted COVID-19 tests when ordered by a provider, but their current access to free over-the-counter (OTC) COVID-19 tests will end, consistent with the statute on Medicare payment for OTC tests set by Congress.

Certain Medicare and Medicaid waivers and broad flexibilities for health care providers are no longer necessary and will end. During the COVID-19 PHE, CMS has used a combination of emergency authority waivers, regulations, and sub-regulatory guidance to ensure and expand access to care and to give health care providers the flexibilities needed to help keep people safe. States, hospitals, nursing homes, and others are currently operating under hundreds of these waivers that affect care delivery and payment and that are integrated into patient care and provider systems. Many of these waivers and flexibilities were necessary to expand facility capacity for the health care system and to allow the health care system to weather the heightened strain created by COVID-19; given the current state of COVID-19, this excess capacity is no longer necessary. CMS developed a roadmap for the eventual end of the COVID-19 PHE, which was published in August 2022, and has been sharing information on what health care facilities and providers can do to prepare for future emergencies.

The company said they will soon start the roll out to additional countries and that an Android version is in the making. According to OpenAI, the launch of their iOS app responds to the aim of making their technology more readily accessible to users. As a side-effect, OpenAI will likely get to establish some order in the App Store, which has been flooded by many ChatGPT clients in the last few months, with several of them allegedly having 7-figure revenues. Although this does not necessarily mean all of those apps are profitable, as Twitter user Andrey Zagoruyko remarks, it clearly hints at the huge interest that ChatGPT has met among the general public. While several comments on Hacker News point out that the app does not seem much more than a Web view wrapper around OpenAI website, it still provides a couple of distinctive features that bring an improved user experience, including full chat history and chat synchronization across devices, as well as voice input.","Jaccard Noise_60":0.25,"Cosine Noise_60":0.8251758814,"EM Noise_60":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_60":0,"Noise_80 Predicted Answer":"Today,","Noise_80 Document Index":"1","Noise_80 Document":"The ChatGPT app syncs your conversations, supports voice input, and brings our latest model improvements to your fingertips.

The previous CBA that ended the 2011 lockout instituted no immediate changes to the draft, but it called for a committee of owners and players to discuss further charges.  Players who were not automatically eligible had to declare their eligibility for the draft by notifying the NBA offices in writing no later than at least 60 days before the event. For the 2023 draft, the date fell on April 23. Under the CBA a player may withdraw his name from consideration from the draft at any time before the final declaration deadline, which usually falls 10 days before the draft at 5:00 pm EDT (2100 UTC). Under current NCAA rules, players usually have until 10 days after the draft combine to withdraw from the draft and retain college eligibility. They must have withdrawn on or before May 31, 22 days prior to this draft.[70]  A player who has hired an agent retains his remaining college eligibility regardless of whether he is drafted after an evaluation from the NBA Undergraduate Advisory Committee.

Apple Vision Pro is a \"mixed reality\" headset, meaning it can display both virtual and augmented reality content. It is not like augmented reality glasses, however, as it is designed to completely cover the eyes and block out all of your surroundings.   Apple is using exterior and interior cameras for the augmented reality component of the device. The cameras are able to map the space around you and project the real world back to you, so though you're not actually looking at what's around you using see-through glasses, you are effectively seeing an accurate picture of your real world environment.  With this capability, Apple can show you 3D windows, objects, and content in your actual space, or the cameras can be turned off to shut out the world to provide an entirely virtual setting. Apple is focusing on the headset's ability to allow for working, content consumption, gaming, communication and other activities to be done \"anywhere\" with just the Vision Pro.","Jaccard Noise_40":1.0,"Cosine Noise_40":1.0,"EM Noise_40":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":1,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"$3500.","Noise_60 Document Index":"7","Noise_60 Document":"Jun 6, 2023 ...

At its annual developer conference, Apple also introduced a raft of new products and features, including a 15-inch MacBook Air, a powerful chip called M2 Ultra, improvements to its iOS software and a long-awaited tweak to prevent its autocorrect from annoyingly changing a common expletive to \"ducking\". The Vision Pro will start at $3,499, more than three times the cost of the priciest headset in Meta's line of mixed and virtual reality devices. The headset will test a market crowded with devices that have yet to gain traction with consumers and put it in direct competition with Facebook-owner Meta after years of clashes between the companies over issues like user privacy and control of developer platforms. Apple emphasized the novelty of the headset's augmented reality features as well as the sports and entertainment partnerships it would offer. The device will use a new chip called R1 that will process information from its sensors in less time than the blink of an eye, Apple said.

Maven, which was founded in 2014 when telemedicine was first starting to take off, aspires to solve both of these problems, helping millions find support in areas like fertility, pregnancy, adoption, parenting, and pediatrics. Maven founder and CEO Kate Ryder joined Scarlet Fu, Bloomberg Television and Bloomberg QuickTake host, for an online talk on Thursday, September 30, as part of the Cornell Tech @ Bloomberg Speaker Series. She shared the story of her career transition from journalism to venture capitalist to entrepreneurship, the birth of her startup, and the lessons she\u2019s learned on the road to building a company valued at more than $1 billion. Ryder is a born storyteller, having begun her career as a journalist, writing about finance and business. One of her earliest breaks was ghostwriting the memoir of former U.S. Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, which dealt with Paulson\u2019s experience during the financial crisis of 2008. \u201cSo much about entrepreneurship is figuring out the signal in the noise,\u201d says Ryder, comparing her recent career as a CEO to her start in journalism.
