Even better for the company, it ended the year with a bang, racking up a record number of sales in the last quarter of 2021, or 308,600 units. Most of that total consisted of Model 3 and Model Y models, no surprise. It\u2019s the sixth consecutive quarter that it breaks its record for sales. In 2019, the automaker delivered 367,500 units, so annual sales growth, while not exponential, is clearly accelerating. The company has said in the past that one its main goals is to attain 50 percent sales growth year after year. Once upon a time, Tesla struggled mightily to hit its delivery targets, but no more. There\u2019s also no sign of that growth slowing down any time soon, even as all-electric rivals join the market by the month.

The results, visualized below, are truly remarkable. Let's take a look at the details and then check out the outlook. Tesla produced 305,840 electric cars and delivered 308,650 during the period, which both are record numbers. The growth is associated with the Model 3\/Model Y, as the Model S\/Model X are in the ramp-up phase after a major refresh. As we can see, the global vehicle inventory (days of supply) further decreased to just 4 days. That's an amazing result and a true sign of how high the imbalance is between demand and supply. In 2021, Tesla produced 930,422 electric cars and delivered 936,222. It's a new record.

Activision shares are trading about 24% below its acquisition price of $95 per share.\u00a0 Here's a look at what happened since the deal was announced and whether Activision Blizzard is a buy. The market, fearing antitrust concerns, was skeptical that regulators would approve Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard from the beginning.

As such, Lost Ark is running against limited competition.

Russia's President Vladimir Putin has given varying public explanations for why he launched the invasion. Here are the reasons Putin gave, how they match with reality, and the other likely reasons why Russia sent its armed forces into an independent, sovereign nation. Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union, before declaring itself an independent country, cementing the move in a referendum days before the USSR collapsed in December 1991. The country has maintained its independence ever since. But Putin still refers to Ukraine as Russian, and denies it's a nation in its own right. He told then-US President George W. Bush in 2008 that Ukraine wasn't even a country. Stephen Hall, a Russian politics expert at the University of Bath in the UK, said many Russians still hold this view, and that \"it isn't just the Kremlin.\" Hall said Russia sees Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, as the \"mother of Russian cities,\" and for Putin he can't have that being outside his own country. Hall added that Russia needs to claim Ukraine in order to back up its argument to being a great power that has existed for millennia. Without it \"Russia can't claim a thousand years of history because Kyiv was already in existence 1,200 years ago, when Moscow was a forest,\" he said.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.6666666667,"Cosine Noise_0":0.8160431981,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"24 February 2022","Noise_20 Document Index":"7","Noise_20 Document":"Northeastern Ukraine campaign  Eastern Ukraine campaign  Southern Ukraine campaign  2023 Ukrainian counteroffensive  Other regions  Naval operations  Spillover and cross-border incidents  Resistance  Related  Attacks on civilians  On 24 February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine in an escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian War which began in 2014. The invasion has killed tens of thousands on both sides. Russian forces have been responsible for mass civilian casualties and for torturing captured Ukrainian soldiers. By June 2022, about 8 million Ukrainians had been internally displaced. More than 8.2\u00a0million had fled the country by May 2023, becoming Europe's largest refugee crisis since World War II. Extensive environmental damage, widely described as ecocide, contributed to food crises worldwide.  Prior to the invasion, Russian troops concentrated near Ukraine's borders, as Russian officials denied plans to attack. Vladimir Putin announced a \"special military operation\" to support the breakaway republics of Donetsk and Luhansk, whose military forces were fighting Ukraine in the Donbas conflict, claiming the goal was to \"demilitarise\" and \"denazify\" Ukraine. Putin espoused irredentist views, challenged Ukraine's right to exist, and falsely claimed that Ukraine was governed by neo-Nazis persecuting the ethnic Russian minority.","Jaccard Noise_20":0.6666666667,"Cosine Noise_20":0.8145216107,"EM Noise_20":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":1,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"September 15, 2022","Noise_40 Document Index":"1","Noise_40 Document":"30, Putin signs documents to\u00a0annex the four regions\u00a0at a Kremlin ceremony.

It was released for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X\/S on February 25 by FromSoftware in Japan and Bandai Namco Entertainment internationally. Players control a customizable player character who is on a quest to repair the Elden Ring and become the new Elden Lord.  Elden Ring is presented through a third-person perspective; players freely roam its interactive open world. The six main areas are traversed using the player character's steed Torrent as the primary mode of travel. Linear, hidden dungeons can be explored to find useful items. Players can use several types of weapons and magic spells, including non-direct engagement enabled by stealth mechanics. Throughout the game's world, checkpoints enable fast travel and allow players to improve their attributes using an in-game currency called Runes. Elden Ring has an online multiplayer mode in which players can join each other for cooperative and player-versus-player combat.  During planning, FromSoftware wanted to create an open-world game with gameplay similar to Dark Souls; the company wanted Elden Ring to act as an evolution of the self-titled debut of the series.

The front-facing camera also has autofocus for the first time.[30]  The cameras use Apple's latest computational photography engine, called Smart HDR 4. Users can also choose from a range of photographic styles during capture, including rich contrast, vibrant, warm, and cool. Apple clarifies this is different from a filter because it works intelligently with the image processing algorithm during capture to apply local adjustments to an image, and the effects will be baked into the photos, unlike filters which can be removed after applying.[6]  The camera app contains Cinematic Mode, which allows users to rack focus between subjects and create (simulate) shallow depth of field using software algorithms. It is supported on wide and front-facing cameras in 4K at 30 fps.[6]  The iPhone 14 is equipped with slightly longer battery life compared to the iPhone 13.

Check out some fun facts about the cast. The 2022 film The Lost City is the perfect combination of comedy, adventure, romance, and an incredibly talented cast capable of pulling off any role. This film directed by Adam and Aaron Nee, from a story by Seth Gordon, features Loretta Sage, a brilliant author who writes romance novels set in exotic locations featuring Dr. Angela Lovemore and her romantic interest, Dash McMahon. But Loretta's real life bears no resemblance to the things she writes: after her husband's death, she became a reclusive, grumpy woman who is not even eager to write anymore. Halfway through a promotional tour for her latest novel, Loretta is kidnapped by a lunatic billionaire who wants her to lead him to a lost city treasure she depicted in her book. Fortunately, Loretta won't be alone: Alan, the cover model of her books, sets out on a journey to rescue her and demonstrate that he can also be a hero. Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum headline this blockbuster alongside Daniel Radcliffe, Da'Vine Joy Randolph, Brad Pitt, and Oscar Nunez, among other actors.

{"Query":"What happened at the Academy Awards involving Will Smith and Chris Rock?","Correct Answer":["slapped"],"Noise_0 Predicted Answer":"slapped comedian Chris Rock across the face","Noise_0 Document Index":"5","Noise_0 Document":"During the 94th Academy Awards on March 27, 2022, actor Will Smith walked onstage and slapped comedian Chris Rock across the face during Rock's presentation for Best Documentary Feature. The slap was in response to Rock's joke about Smith's wife Jada Pinkett Smith's shaved head, which she had been shaving since 2021 due to alopecia areata. Smith returned to his seat and shouted profanity at Rock, who briefly responded, but completed his presentation without further interruption.  Later that evening, Smith won Best Actor and apologized to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and other nominees, but not to Rock, in his acceptance speech. The next day, he issued an apology to Rock and the Academy through social media. Smith resigned his Academy membership on April 1, facing a potential suspension or expulsion, and was banned from attending Academy events for 10 years, effective April 8.  Live television broadcasts in the United States mostly muted the incident due to federal censorship laws. However, uncensored international footage went viral on social media; an excerpt from the Australian broadcast became one of the most-viewed online videos in the first 24 hours. The incident received worldwide attention and largely overshadowed the rest of the ceremony.  After the ceremony, some publications recalled Rock's past remarks about Jada Pinkett Smith. In 1997, he had commented on her participation in the Million Woman March in an interview on his late night-talk show, The Chris Rock Show.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.1666666667,"Cosine Noise_0":0.4331899583,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"the slap","Noise_20 Document Index":"2","Noise_20 Document":"It was one of the most infamous moments in Academy Awards history that became known as\u00a0\"the slap.\"\u00a0The world could\u00a0not stop talking about Will Smith striking comedian Chris Rock onstage at the 2022 Oscars after Rock made a joke about Smith's\u00a0wife, Jada Pinkett Smith.\u00a0 A lot has happened since the slap:\u00a0Will Smith apologized (twice) and was banned from Academy events for 10 years.

Musk pledged to provide $46.5 billion in equity and debt financing for the acquisition, which covered the $44 billion price tag and the closing costs. Banks, including Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), committed to provide $13 billion in debt financing.

Musk's $33.5 billion equity commitment included his 9.6% Twitter stake, which is worth $4 billion, and the $7.1 billion he had secured from equity investors, including Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) co-founder Larry Ellison and Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.9033486843,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"$44 billion","Noise_20 Document Index":"0","Noise_20 Document":"By\u00a0         Wailin Wong       ,\u00a0         Darian Woods       ,\u00a0        Nicky Ouellet         ,\u00a0         Kate Concannon       Yes, Elon Musk is the richest person in the world.

The world No. 1 finished ahead of Northern Irishman Rory McIlroy to claim his first major title.            After two close-range misses on the 18th green, he rolled home the winning putt and carded a final round one-under par 71 to finish on 10-under for the tournament, three shots ahead of second-placed McIlroy.            Over the four days at the lush, sprawling golf club in Augusta, Georgia, Scheffler produced some excellent golf, refusing to falter under the pressure of being the tournament\u2019s leader for nearly three days.            In the end, he was rewarded for his recent run of good form, winning the most prestigious tournament title out there, as well as going home with the famous green jacket and the $2.7 million winners purse.            Asked how he felt in the immediate aftermath, Scheffler said he was \u201cpretty tired.\u201d           \u201cI want to go home!

Scheffler was two shots off the lead after 18 holes, then put together the to-that-point round of the tournament during Friday's second round to establish a five-stroke lead heading into the weekend. It hasn't all been stress-free for Scheffler as he's defended that lead across Saturday and Sunday, but four birdies and plenty of par saves kept the chase pack at arm's length all throughout the final round.\u00a0 There are multiple levels of history being made by Scheffler here with the win. He's becomes just the fifth golfer in Masters history to win while being ranked No. 1 in the world (sixth time it's happened, though, as Tiger Woods did it twice). This is also adding to what's becoming a stunning run here in 2022 for Scheffler, who did not have a PGA Tour win at the start of the year and now has four of them including one major championship in just 57 days, the fastest such mark in history.

However, traditional automakers are unable to cope with the rising demand for pure EVs, whereas Tesla\u2019s ability to address this demand has rewarded it not only with higher vehicle sales in Q1 2022 but also a record revenue of $18.8 billion.

From the second week of March, rising cases of a new COVID variant have forced automakers operating around Shanghai to suspend production.

Shipping two 40-pound Pelicans can\u2019t be cheap To me, those giant Pelican cases are the proof. It would cost Apple a fortune to ship 79 pounds of equipment to individual homes all over the country, even with corporate discounts. The Verge is obviously far, far smaller than Apple, but it would cost us upwards of $200 just to return those cases to their sender. Yet Apple offers free shipping both directions with your $49 rental, plus a dedicated support team to validate your parts and facilitate returns. (Though, apparently, it doesn\u2019t do the latter anywhere near its Silicon Valley HQ: when I took the support team up on its offer of picking up my battery, they told me they didn\u2019t have a driver within 250 miles of my location, and I should just drop it off at the nearest Home Depot.) I don\u2019t think Apple expects anyone to seriously take it up on the offer of self-service repair kits.

After renting the tool kit and purchasing the battery bundle, Barbera ended up spending about $120 to repair the device himself instead of the $69 it would have cost him to let Apple replace it. In the review he noted a few components were missing from the kit including heat protective-gloves and tweezers, both of which were stated as required in the manual. Barbera also purchased extra supplies that were recommended but not required, such as rubbing alcohol to help loosen the adhesive.\u00a0 Not every repair is more expensive. Several would end up being cheaper to repair yourself, and Apple does offer return credit for select parts that are replaced as a small silver lining, but according to MacRumors, the risk of damaging your own device and having to pay even more to replace it is far greater than the benefits.

Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories. While many big games have been delayed recently, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is moving in the opposite direction: Nintendo announced that the sci-fi RPG will now launch on July 29th instead of the previously planned September release. No specific reason was given for the change. The game will be a Nintendo Switch exclusive. Xenoblade Chronicles 3 will be the first main game in the series since its predecessor debuted on the Switch in 2017 and Nintendo first announced it earlier this year as part of the February 2022 Nintendo Direct. Like the rest of the series, the new game takes place in an expansive sci-fi universe; in addition to the release date, Nintendo also revealed a new trailer (embedded above) to further tease the story and world. The change in release date comes at a time when plenty of major releases have been delayed for various reasons, including the challenge of developing games remotely during the pandemic. Most recently, this has affected games like Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League and Nintendo\u2019s own sequel to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, both of which have been delayed until 2023.  \/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.","Jaccard Noise_20":0.3333333333,"Cosine Noise_20":0.9852647781,"EM Noise_20":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":0,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"July 29, 2022","Noise_40 Document Index":"7","Noise_40 Document":"Release date.

They were essentially treated as disposable.  Now on-set animal action, in the United States at least, is monitored by the nonprofit American Humane. Plus, animals on screen are increasingly computer-generated images or motion capture marvels that fuse digital imagery with human actors, as was the case in the award-winning rebooted Planet of the Apes trilogy starring Andy Serkis as the lead chimpanzee, Caesar. We have both reformed and replaced animals\u2019 work in the making of entertainment. Horses and chimpanzees are now often placed on opposite sides of a perceived line between accepted and unacceptable animal use. Most horses are domesticated and have worked for humans for thousands of years. Their careers, reproduction and social lives are largely controlled by humans. In contrast, although individual chimpanzees have been held captive, their species remains wild.","Jaccard Noise_60":0.0,"Cosine Noise_60":0.3791771531,"EM Noise_60":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_60":0,"Noise_80 Predicted Answer":"Annie G","Noise_80 Document Index":"3","Noise_80 Document":"Reporters at the time called the feat a \u201cgreat success\u201d and debated over who deserved more credit\u2014Muybridge for devising the setup or Stanford for financing it.

In countless yet seamless ways, Peele completely deconstructs any ideas the media have presented us about aliens in the past. Nope is an original, atypical alien film that uses the mode of otherworldly forces to explore the idea of the spectacle and \u201cthe good and the bad that come from this idea of attention.\u201d The first notion of the spectacle that Peele introduces in Nope is the discussion surrounding the first moving picture ever created by Eadweard Muybridge in the 19th century. This is mentioned because the black jockey that was riding the horse in those photographs has been seen by all but goes unnamed throughout history, while the white photographer lives in infamy. The even more personal connection to this is that the jockey was the great-great-great grandfather of Nope\u2019s two protagonists, siblings OJ Haywood (Daniel Kaluuya) and Emerald Haywood (Keke Palmer). This concept of the spectacle quickly grows larger than life as it takes a variety of forms throughout Nope that all revolve around exploitation.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.4330081642,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

Heading up the cast is Joo Won as Carter Lee, later revealed as also going by the name Michael Bane. The film begins with Carter waking up in a blood-soaked bed in Seoul with a cross-shaped scar on the back of his head and no memory of who he is. With a premise similar to Hardcore Henry, Carter also features video game logic in its action sequences. Joo Won is a South Korean actor best known for his roles in television, including the main protagonist in Good Doctor, which is played by Freddie Highmore in the American adaptation.  Kim Jong-hyeok is a North Korean General who meets Carter during his mission, providing him transport out of South Korea. General Kim is played by Lee Sung-jae, a veteran South Korean actor with credits in TV and film.

That is the core of its business model, and that\u2019s what drives its monopoly power and profit,\u201d says Evan Greer, director of the nonprofit digital rights organization Fight for the Future. \u201cAmazon wants to have its hands everywhere, and acquiring a company that\u2019s essentially built on mapping the inside of people\u2019s homes seems like a natural extension of the surveillance reach that Amazon already has.\u201d Amazon declined to respond to questions about how it would use iRobot data, but company spokesperson Alexandra Miller provided a statement that claimed the company had been a good steward of customer information. \"Customer trust is something we have worked hard to earn\u2014and work hard to keep\u2014every day,\u201d the statement said.  Amazon has a track record of making or acquiring technology that makes those concerned with data privacy uneasy. In 2020, Amazon introduced a home security drone, and last month Ring, a company that\u2019s forged partnerships with thousands of police and fire departments, admitted to sharing home video footage with law enforcement without a warrant.

On Friday, iRobot reported its quarterly results. Revenue plunged 30% primarily on order reductions and delays, and the company announced it was laying off 10% of its workforce.  Amazon said it will acquire iRobot for $61 per share in an all-cash transaction that will include iRobot\u2019s net debt. The company has total current debt of approximately $332.1 million as of July 2. The deal is subject to approval by shareholders and regulators. Upon completion, iRobot\u2019s CEO, Colin Angle, will remain in his position. Noting that iRobot has been running its robotics platform on Amazon\u2019s cloud service unit AWS for many years, Su said the acquisition could lead to more integration of Amazon speech recognition and other capabilities into vacuums. In afternoon trading, iRobot shares rose 19%. Amazon\u2019s were down 1.7%. The deal comes as anti-monopoly advocates continue to raise concerns about Amazon\u2019s increasing dominance. The purchase of iRobot is Amazon\u2019s fourth-largest acquisition, led by its $13.7 billion deal to buy Whole Foods in 2017.

Remember, Windows 11 21H2 is good until Oct. 8, 2024 \u2014 and 22H2 gets support until Oct. 14, 2025. The dates are different for Windows 11 Home and Pro users: 21H2 gets security patches until Oct. 10, 2023 and 22H2 gets patches through Oct. 14, 2024.

The chip houses two gold-colored 5nm core chiplets, each sporting eight cores. AMD says these are based on an optimized version of TSMC's high-performance 5nm process technology called N5, and they are placed much closer together than we've seen with previous Ryzen core chiplets. In addition, we see what appears to be a shim between the two core chiplets, likely to maintain an even surface atop the two dies. It is also possible that this close orientation is due to some type of advanced packaging interconnect between the two chips.  We can also see a clear outline around the top of each CCD, but we aren't sure if this is from a new metallization technique. We do know that the gold color is due to Backside Metallization (BSM), which includes an Au coating to prevent oxidation while improving TIM adhesion and lowering thermal impedance. We also see quite a few empty spots for capacitors, which is interesting and could imply heftier designs down the road.

The increase follows several others, including one just months ago, when the cost rose from $10,000 to $12,000. This latest hike is tied to a software update (FSD Beta 10.69.2), which improves overall driving smoothness through turns, enhances pedestrian and animal detection, and enables a creep-into-intersection function. Full Self-Driving is Tesla\u2019s disingenuously named suite of advanced driver-assistance features. Currently, it includes all the functionality of Basic and Enhanced Autopilot, plus the ability to slow the vehicle to a stop as it approaches red traffic signals and signs. If you see little importance or utility in the last of those things, you can still get the bulk of Tesla\u2019s magic with Enhanced Autopilot. It costs a relative bargain, at $6,000, and gives your vehicle the ability to park itself and navigate a highway route from on-ramp to off-ramp (including automatic lane changes) with minimal driver involvement. It also includes Summon, which allows the driver to direct a car into or out of a tight parking space while standing outside the vehicle, and Smart Summon, which enables the vehicle to wind its way around objects (such as in a parking lot) to meet the driver.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.9999999404,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"$15,000","Noise_20 Document Index":"1","Noise_20 Document":"Aug 21, 2022 ...

So far the only VR headsets that are wireless as standard are standalone models like the Meta Quest 2, which are by their nature less powerful. HTC has released wireless add-ons for the Vive and Vive Cosmos, but doesn\u2019t support wireless play as standard \u2013 perhaps Sony will take a similar approach and release a wireless adapter post-launch. For a while Sony was playing coy about the silicon inside the PS VR2, but in November 2022 it was announced that MediaTek is providing the chips that power both the headset and the Sense controllers. These are both custom chips, designed in collaboration between MediaTek and Sony, and neither company has revealed much about the specific silicon, but at least we have a name for it. Remember that the bulk of the processing power comes from the PS5 itself though, with MediaTek\u2019s chip only handling things like the displays, tracking, and connectivity.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.5443759561,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

The award was created by the Downtown Athletic Club in 1935 to recognize \"the most valuable college football player east of the Mississippi\", and was first awarded to University of Chicago halfback Jay Berwanger.[1][2]  After the death in October 1936 of the club's athletic director, John Heisman, the award was named in his honor and broadened to include players west of the Mississippi.[3][4] Heisman had been active in college athletics as a football player; a head football, basketball, and baseball coach; and an athletic director.  It is the oldest of several overall awards in college football, including the Maxwell Award, Walter Camp Award, and the AP Player of the Year.

Throughout their adventures, the cast will trek through Jordan, Austria, Italy, France, Spain, and Iceland before arriving at the Nashville finish line.

The first leg of the race required players to drive themselves to three different places before finding Phil at the first Pit Stop. This task went off relatively without a hitch for the teams. The next challenge was more physically demanding, requiring contestants to roll a beer keg (when in Germany) through obstacles in one minute.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":1.0,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"September 21, 2022","Noise_20 Document Index":"4","Noise_20 Document":"The Amazing Race 34 is the thirty-fourth season of the American reality television show The Amazing Race.

It\u2019s also a sneakily compelling morality tale, told deep under the surface of the ocean in a creepy underwater city called Rapture. In between blasting through hordes of Splicers, players are able to simply explore the rotting hallways and dilapidated storefronts of an entire mysterious world, meant as an Ayn Rand-inspired fantasyland for a mysterious historical figure. There\u2019s more to discover than simple shotgun blasts \u2014 although those shotgun blasts are obviously more than satisfying. It\u2019s no wonder the games have sold a combined 39 million copies worldwide.\u00a0 Lawrence is no stranger to dystopia; on top of the three\u00a0Hunger Games\u00a0films he directed, he also led Will Smith through the monster-infested New York of\u00a0I Am Legend. And, of course, his spy thriller\u00a0Red Sparrow saw him take on another crucial part of\u00a0BioShock\u00a0lore: people listening to tapes.","Jaccard Noise_80":1.0,"Cosine Noise_80":0.9999999404,"EM Noise_80":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":1,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"Ken Levine","Noise_100 Document Index":"7","Noise_100 Document":"Working with Netflix has also given Lawrence a sense of freedom that he believes will help him create a faithful BioShock film without studio interference. He continued on, talking about his discussions with Take-Two Interactive and Ken Levine, the man largely responsible for developing the concept for BioShock: There's always discussions about rating and tone. I don't want to get into it too much now because it's pretty early on in the process, but I certainly have not felt stifled in any way, or sent in any directions with Netflix. I mean, basically me and Cameron [MacConomy] who works with me, and Michael are getting to do what we want to do, which is great. A lot of it is staying really true to the game itself, and we're talking to Take-Two [Interactive] and Ken Levine. Despite the confidence, Lawrence is fully aware of how video game movies have failed in the past. Still, he's convinced that BioShock offers something meatier to the table that can survive the jump to the big screen. When asked if he knew about the disconnect in adaptations, he added: No, I do know what you mean. When I think about that, I go back to what we talked about earlier, which is I think that there's some great video games out there, but they don't always have the weight of actual ideas underneath them.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.3792520761,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

A fifth season recently wrapped airing on NBC, but will it head to Netflix? For those unaware, New Amsterdam is the NBC medical drama following Dr. Max Goodwin, played by Ryan Eggold, trying to save one of the oldest public hospitals while also dealing with his own relationships and personal struggles.  Here\u2019s the rundown as a quick recap of New Amsterdam\u2019s trajectory on Netflix thus far. That leads us to season 5 of New Amsterdam. Airing between September 20th, 2022 and January 17th, 2023, the final season of New Amsterdam notably consisted of fewer episodes than the fourth season.  Sadly, we don\u2019t have a Netflix release date for season 5 of New Amsterdam.\u00a0Unlike the prior seasons, we expect the show to have some exclusivity on its main platform to drive viewership and subscribers there. Older seasons haven\u2019t been licensed in any particular pattern, so it\u2019ll likely just come down to when NBC Universal and Netflix can strike a new arrangement.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.6944180131,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":0,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"September 20, 2022","Noise_20 Document Index":"3","Noise_20 Document":"The story is based on the book Twelve Patients: Life and Death at Bellevue Hospital by Eric Manheimer who also doubles as a producer on the show.

The show capped its first season Tuesday night, and while \"Monarch\" opened with a strong rating and ranked as Fox's most-watched fall scripted debut in three years, the following 10 episodes didn't perform as well, Deadline reported. The show created by Melissa London Hilfers was ordered in May 2021 and was intended to launch in January 2022. The debut was scuttled to the fall as a result of the pandemic. \"Monarch\" is a multigenerational country music drama about country music's most influential family -- The Romans. The family is led by tough and talented Dottie Cantrell Roman, played by Sarandon, and her husband Albie, Adkins' character. Sarandon dies in the first episode. The Roman's success is at risk, and the family comes together to protect its legacy and future \u2013 and all costs. Executive producers for the Fox Entertainment-produced series include Hilfers, Gail Berman, Hend Baghdady, and Nashville power manager Jason Owen. \"Right now, we are all living in a really divided country,\" Owen told People when \"Monarch\" debuted. \"When times are tough, you look for something to sort of give you a break from all the noise.","Jaccard Noise_40":0.5,"Cosine Noise_40":0.7003532052,"EM Noise_40":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":0,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"Three-time Academy of Country Music Award winner","Noise_60 Document Index":"7","Noise_60 Document":"Sep 8, 2021 ...

Susie Wallis (Kiersey Clemons) has never met a mystery she couldn\u2019t solve.

It got to the point where she wondered if they should stop reading them altogether, but Susie refused. She didn\u2019t care that she always guessed the culprit. All she cared about was spending time with Mom. So when Anne\u2019s MS diagnosis advanced enough to take away her speech, Susie took over reading duties to keep the tradition alive. And she even took things one step further by choosing to make her mother\u2019s wish come true: using her knack for literary detective work to do good in the world and become famous.

However, in re-imaging the conceit for a feature-length film, she and William Day Frank have smartly pivoted to build a string of reveals that keeps the macabre thrills coming. Admittedly, these jolts can make the movie feel episodic, leading me to wonder if they'd initially conceived of this as a web series or TV show. In the right headspace, this uneven ride can feel like binge-watching an addictive limited series. And, frankly, I value the rough edges when they come with such unexpected fun.\u00a0 For the first act, Susie Searches runs the risk of feeling dated, presenting an amateur detective in the guileless light of literal kids stuff, like Harriet the Spy or Scooby Doo. At this point, we've been so glutted with crime shows that this tact feels tired. However, as Susie solves her mystery, the movie moves into motivations, urging the audience to reconsider their heroine, to re-examine the clues, and to question whether what we want is justice or just a good story.  Kargman and Day weave together a deceptively chipper tone with a cynical thread and an appetite for tension for a finale that is outrageous and rewarding.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.3027313054,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

That \u201csomething\u201d outside of his control, in this case, was the result of the Mars Inc. decision to exit NASCAR at the end of the year, leaving Joe Gibbs Racing (Busch\u2019s current team) without a primary sponsor for Busch\u2019s No. 18 team.

All those questions are certainly being weighed out,\u201d he said then. \u201cAgain, that\u2019s also why it\u2019s not so simple and so easy. So, thankfully there are opportunities out there, here are Cup jobs available. But again, it will not look the same as what it has for the last 15 years.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.23699826,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}
{"Query":"What is men's year-end No 1 in tennis in 2022?","Correct Answer":["Carlos Alcaraz"],"Noise_0 Predicted Answer":"Carlos Alcaraz","Noise_0 Document Index":"2","Noise_0 Document":"The Pepperstone ATP rankings[1] are the Association of Tennis Professionals' (ATP) merit-based system for determining the rankings in men's tennis. The top-ranked player is the player who, over the previous 52 weeks, has garnered the most ranking points on the ATP Tour. Points are awarded based on how far a player advances in tournaments and the category of those tournaments. The ATP has used a computerized system for determining the rankings since August 23, 1973.[2] Starting in 1979, an updated rankings list is released at the beginning of each week. Since 1973, 28 players have been ranked No. 1 by the ATP,[3][4] of which 17 have been year-end No. 1.  The current world number one is Carlos Alcaraz.  Since the introduction of the rankings, the method used to calculate a player's ranking points has changed several times. As of 2019, the rankings are calculated by totaling the points a player wins in his best eighteen tournaments, subject to certain restrictions. For top players the counting tournaments are the four Grand Slam tournaments, the eight mandatory ATP Masters tournaments, the non-mandatory ATP Masters 1000 event in Monte-Carlo, the player's best four eligible ATP Tour 500 tournaments and his best two results from ATP Tour 250 tournaments.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.9999999404,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Carlos Alcaraz","Noise_20 Document Index":"7","Noise_20 Document":"The one major that he did win, Wimbledon, did not award ranking points after Russian and Belarusian players were banned from competing after Russia invaded Ukraine.

The player controls Link as he searches for Princess Zelda and fights to prevent the Demon King from destroying the world.  Tears of the Kingdom was conceived after ideas for Breath of the Wild downloadable content (DLC) had exceeded its scope. Its development was led by Nintendo's Entertainment Planning & Development (EPD) division, specifically Production Group Number 3,[1] with Breath of the Wild director Hidemaro Fujibayashi and producer Eiji Aonuma reprising their roles. A teaser was shown at E3 2019 with a full reveal at E3 2021. Tears of the Kingdom was initially planned for release in 2022 before being delayed to May 2023. It received acclaim for its improvements, expanded open world, and features encouraging exploration and experimentation. It sold more than 10 million copies in its first three days of release, and had sold over 18.5 million copies by June 2023.[2]  Tears of the Kingdom retains the open-world action-adventure gameplay of the previous Zelda game, Breath of the Wild (2017).","Jaccard Noise_60":0.3333333333,"Cosine Noise_60":0.8052191734,"EM Noise_60":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_60":0,"Noise_80 Predicted Answer":"May 12, 2023","Noise_80 Document Index":"4","Noise_80 Document":"Release date.

Her death was publicly announced at 18:30. She was succeeded by her eldest son, Charles III.  The death of Queen Elizabeth II set in motion Operation London Bridge, a collection of plans including arrangements for her state funeral, and supported by Operation Unicorn, which set protocols for her death occurring in Scotland. The United Kingdom observed a national mourning period of 10 days. The Queen's lying in state took place in Westminster Hall from 14 to 19\u00a0September, during which time an estimated 250,000 people queued to pay their respects.  Elizabeth's state funeral on 19 September was the first held in Britain since Winston Churchill's in 1965. A funeral service was held at Westminster Abbey, followed by a procession to Wellington Arch that featured around 3,000 military personnel and was watched by around a million people in central London. The state hearse then transported the Queen's coffin to Windsor, followed by another procession through Windsor Great Park and a committal service at St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle.","Jaccard Noise_20":0.25,"Cosine Noise_20":0.7721886039,"EM Noise_20":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":0,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"Monday","Noise_40 Document Index":"1","Noise_40 Document":"hide caption                   The country's longest-serving monarch aged 96 after 70 years on the throne.

Both passengers in the Cessna 172 died on the scene, the Boulder County Sheriff\u2019s Office said. There was one confirmed occupant in the other aircraft, who was also reported deceased upon the arrival of first responders, the sheriff\u2019s office said.           When first responders arrived on the scene, they discovered two separate crash sites, according to the Boulder County Sheriff\u2019s Office.           The first aircraft was found on the south side of Niwot Road, while the second aircraft was found on the north side.           Authorities have not yet identified the three people who died in the crash, police said.            The FAA and NTSB are investigating the crash.    \u00a9 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

By including this line in the episode, the \"House of the Dragon\" writers are emphasizing how Alicent's direct barbs helped lead to Ser Harwin and Lyonel Strong's deaths in the final minutes of the episode.

This GPU is currently among the most powerful on the market, and if you want to play the latest games at the highest framerates, you'll need the best gaming PCs packing high-octane cards like this one. Presently, the GeForce RTX 4090 is the top-of-the-line card in Nvidia's 40-series of GeForce RTX GPUs, which were officially announced in September 2022.

It was released worldwide on November 9, 2022, for both the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5, marking the first cross-gen release in the God of War series. It is the ninth installment in the series, the ninth chronologically, and the sequel to 2018's God of War. Loosely based on Norse mythology, the game is set in ancient Scandinavia and features series protagonist, Kratos, and his now teenage son, Atreus. Concluding the Norse era of the series, the game covers Ragnar\u00f6k, the eschatological event which is central to Norse mythology and was foretold to happen in the previous game after Kratos killed the Aesir god Baldur.  The gameplay is similar to the previous 2018 installment. It features combo-based combat, as well as puzzle and role-playing elements. The gameplay has been revamped from the previous game: in addition to Kratos' main weapons, a magical battle axe and his double-chained blades, he also acquires a magical spear and his shield has become more versatile, with different types of shields that have differing offensive and defensive abilities. His son Atreus, as well as some other characters, provide assistance in combat and can be passively controlled.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.6666666667,"Cosine Noise_0":0.7897343636,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"11\/9\/2022","Noise_20 Document Index":"8","Noise_20 Document":"Standard Edition.

United States Republicans have regained control of the House of Representatives, securing a narrow majority in a midterm election that saw the party fail to meet expectations. The Associated Press declared Republican Mike Garcia the winner in California\u2019s 27th congressional district Wednesday, giving the GOP 218 seats, the threshold for the majority needed to take over the lower chamber of Congress. Republican Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy will likely become House speaker when the new Congress convenes early next year after his party nominated him to the position on Tuesday. He will replace Democrat Nancy Pelosi who has held the gavel since 2019. Although the much-anticipated \u201cred wave\u201d of Republican victories did not materialise, Republican candidates were able to gain at least five House seats in the November 8 midterms, wiping out the Democrats\u2019 thin majority.  Democrats were able to flip a few districts, but they suffered overall net losses, narrowly losing key races in New York, Florida and other states. Redistricting after the 2020 Census had given conservatives an edge in several parts of the country. Even with a less-than-ideal election performance, control of the House will allow Republicans to halt President Joe Biden\u2019s legislative agenda in its tracks.

The governor\u2019s race is within the margin of error, but the senate race is not.

Still, Republicans remained close to winning control of the U.S. House of Representatives as officials continued counting ballots cast in Tuesday's U.S. midterm elections. Cortez Masto narrowly defeated Republican challenger Adam Laxalt, a former state attorney general who was endorsed by former President Donald Trump. With Masto's victory on the heels of Democratic Senator Mark Kelly winning re-election in Arizona late on Friday, Democrats will control at least 50 Senate seats, with Vice President Kamala Harris able to break ties in the 100-member chamber. \"America showed that we believe in our democracy, that the roots of democracy are deep and strong,\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, told a news conference. The Senate is currently split 50-50 between Democrats and Republicans. The newly elected Senate will be sworn in on Jan. 3. Continued control of the Senate means Democrats will still be able to approve Biden's nominees such as federal judges. Should a vacancy open in the next two years, that would mean any appointees to the Supreme Court.

A move to add seven days of paid sick leave failed in Congress before Mr. Biden signed the bill.

Online voters selected Cheboi as the top winner from a field of 10 heroes. On a full scholarship at Augustana College in Illinois, she \"fell in love\" with computer science and knew she had found her career path. It wasn't until she began working in the software industry, however, that she realized that companies just throw away computers when it's time for an update. She said she knew there were children in Kenya who had no idea what a computer was and so TechLit Africa was born. TechLit Africa currently serves 10 schools and Cheboi hopes to be in 100 more within a year. Her students attend daily classes in a variety of computer skills, including coding, and they also have the opportunity to engage in remote learning. \"They can go from doing a remote class with NASA on education to music production,\" Cheboi said.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":1.0,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Nelly Cheboi","Noise_20 Document Index":"7","Noise_20 Document":"Nelly Cheboi was selected by viewers as the 2022 CNN Hero of the Year.

The inequities between the men and women were obvious and stark, which put the NCAA into damage-control mode. At that point, those in the women's basketball world had to question if Emmert was very sincere in his concern, but there was a \"better-late-than-never\" sentiment. And the NCAA's decision to commission the so-called Kaplan report, which did a deep dive into inequities in all men's and women's NCAA championships, was an important step because it didn't pull any punches about how significant those issues have been. The report also said the NCAA has been selling women's sports short regarding potential television revenue. When it's time to negotiate TV rights again, rather than selling multiple championships in a bargain bundle, the NCAA needs to think bigger about the worth of each championship and how best to maximize revenue from it. Also, the NCAA has to show more leadership regarding the inclusion of transgender athletes in competition. As with so many things, the NCAA has been behind on this. Dave Wilson: The next leader is going to have to get creative to figure out the mess of issues currently embroiling college sports, or finally just step out of the way and put on tournaments.

View all partners In winning the 2023 Academy Award for best animated feature, director Guillermo del Toro\u2019s Pinocchio continues its remarkable run of accolades, from the Golden Globes to the Baftas. Del Toro has used the platform afforded by his nominations to champion the medium of animation as true cinema, proclaiming in his Bafta award speech:  Animation is not a genre for kids. It\u2019s a medium for art, it\u2019s a medium for film and I think animation should stay in the conversation. His rendition of Pinocchio has certainly started a conversation, not least in gaining an impressive audience on Netflix. His film demonstrates that in the right creative environment \u2013 and with an innovator at the helm \u2013 a well-worn narrative, such as Pinocchio, can evolve. Such revitalisation of the Pinocchio story was in part possible because \u2013 as he says himself \u2013 del Toro didn\u2019t craft his retelling solely with children in mind.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.25,"Cosine Noise_100":0.738961339,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

One should expect a certain level of creative committee-mandated, Mad Libs-y monotony, regardless of how one feels about the surprisingly decent \u201cShazam!\u201d. The makers of that fine-enough 2019 franchise-starter, including director David F.\u00a0Sandberg,\u00a0toned down both the Troma Lite cynicism and post-Spielberg sentimentality that\u2019s come to define the lighthearted James Gunn-style super-projects that dominate the\u00a0landscape. \u201cShazam! Fury of the Gods\u201d meanders further in that direction. The first \u201cShazam!\u201d works as well as it does because it\u2019s mostly focused on two adolescent pipsqueaks, Billy Batson (Asher Angel) and Freddy Freeman (Jack Dylan Grazer), who get sucked into a generic fantasy, with some assistance from their extended family of orphan buddies. \u201cShazam! Fury of the Gods\u201d mostly sticks to the comic book formula that the first movie poked fun at, despite another strong comedic performance from star Zachary Levi and some sporadic yuks throughout.

We appreciate our dedicated fanbase who came along for this wonderful ride and are excited to share this final season with them.\" NBC paired the news with a trailer for the upcoming season, which teased former Blacklisters returning for their ultimate revenge. It also included a look back at the show's last decade since its September 2013 debut and even featured Megan Boone's Liz Keen. \"When all this began, I was such a different person.

Pikmin 4 is set to launch for the Nintendo Switch on July 21 and marks the newest numbered entry in the real-time strategy series in over ten years, making its release quite the big deal for hardcore fans. Instead of playing as Captain Olimar (who most people know from Super Smash Bros. at this point) or any of his space explorer comrades, gamers will get to customize their own character (a series first). There are not too many options available, but it's still a step forward in terms of a character creator in a Nintendo first-party title. Pikmin 4 comes out in a couple of days and retails for $59.99, the same price as most other major games on the Switch.

After this, the IWGA bought back the commercial rights, and the organising committees of the host cities have been responsible for the organisation and financing since. This led to the organisers of The World Games in The Hague (1993) asking the participants to pay accommodation costs.[9]  The 1997 edition of the Games was due to be held in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, but in August 1994, Port Elizabeth pulled out of hosting the Games due to the political situation in the country.[10] Lahti in Finland volunteered to host instead and signed the host contract in January 1995.

Launched at Wednesday\u2019s\u00a0Google I\/O conference, the\u00a0Pixel Fold\u00a0is Google\u2019s first entry into the growing foldables category and comes with a 7.6-inch main display and a 5.8-inch external panel. Google touts this as the thinnest foldable in the markets where it will be sold, which include the US, UK, Germany and Japan. The company also rolled out its first Pixel-branded tablet and a $499 Pixel 7a, trickling down its\u00a02022 flagship phone\u2019s features to a more affordable price point. The three devices use an in-house chip known as the Tensor G2.\u00a0 The move into the pricier foldables category marks a strategy shift for Google, which has so far focused on undercutting the cost of rival devices. The Pixel Fold is Google\u2019s most expensive handset to date, matching the price of Samsung\u2019s latest\u00a0Galaxy Z Fold 4\u00a0and including high-end specifications like 512 gigabytes of onboard storage. Samsung remains the sales leader in foldables \u2014 with 79% of the market last year, according to IDC \u2014 having kicked off the category four years ago with the Galaxy Fold.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.3333333333,"Cosine Noise_0":0.6640124321,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":0,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Pixel 7 Pro","Noise_20 Document Index":"3","Noise_20 Document":"What else might you do with a foldable? With the device unfolded, I ran two apps side by side, which was useful for reading a webpage while typing an email. Google also demonstrated how its translation app could take advantage of the two screens. Consider a situation in which you, an English speaker, are trying to communicate with someone who speaks Chinese. Holding the phone unfolded, you can speak English into the microphone and have the phone\u2019s outer screen show text translated into Chinese to the other person. When the Chinese speaker responds, you can read the translated text on the inner screen. This feature will not be released until the fall, so I didn\u2019t get to test it. But it\u2019s an intriguing use case. In the end, the device is expensive because it is packed with advanced technology with no major trade-offs. In my tests, its camera produced crisp and vibrant images on a par with photos taken with Apple\u2019s latest iPhone and the Pixel 7 Pro, Google\u2019s $900 smartphone, which has an excellent camera. Though the Pixel Fold\u2019s high price will make it inaccessible to most people, it was an exciting glimpse into the next step for smartphones. Over the last five years, as phone screens got bigger, we have voted with our wallets and shown that we prefer larger screens, so long as they come on devices easy to carry everywhere.

The previous CBA that ended the 2011 lockout instituted no immediate changes to the draft, but it called for a committee of owners and players to discuss further charges.  Players who were not automatically eligible had to declare their eligibility for the draft by notifying the NBA offices in writing no later than at least 60 days before the event. For the 2023 draft, the date fell on April 23. Under the CBA a player may withdraw his name from consideration from the draft at any time before the final declaration deadline, which usually falls 10 days before the draft at 5:00 pm EDT (2100 UTC). Under current NCAA rules, players usually have until 10 days after the draft combine to withdraw from the draft and retain college eligibility. They must have withdrawn on or before May 31, 22 days prior to this draft.[70]  A player who has hired an agent retains his remaining college eligibility regardless of whether he is drafted after an evaluation from the NBA Undergraduate Advisory Committee.

A soft, fitted Light Seal attaches magnetically to the frame and conforms to your face to block out light.  Two Audio Straps with built-in speakers are positioned at the sides of the headset, delivering Spatial Audio that blends what you're hearing on the headset with what's going on in the real world. The Audio Straps connect to a 3D knitted headband that holds the Vision Pro in place. Apple designed it to be breathable, cushiony, and stretchy for comfort, and a Fit Dial ensures the headset fits tight against your head. Apple plans to offer Light Seals and headbands in multiple sizes, and these components are swappable.  Inside the frame, there are two micro-OLED displays that deliver over 4K resolution to each eye for a total of 23 million pixels. There's also an external display called EyeSight that projects an image of your eyes so people can tell whether you're using the headset in an immersive mode or if you can see what's going on around you. For glasses wearers, there are custom prescription Zeiss Optical Inserts that can be attached magnetically to the headset's lenses. playSubscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel for more videos.","Jaccard Noise_80":0.6666666667,"Cosine Noise_80":0.7481936812,"EM Noise_80":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":1,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"augmented reality","Noise_100 Document Index":"2","Noise_100 Document":"Apple has begun the trademark application process for a variety of \u2018reality\u2019 names, as it prepares to introduce its first augmented reality headset device. Bloomberg reports that companies linked to Apple have applied for names including \u2018Reality One\u2019, \u2018Reality Pro\u2019 and \u2018Reality Processor\u2019. Do not expect the headset to appear as part of the iPhone 14 event on September 7 however. The latest rumors generally point to a product launch of the headset early in 2023. Apple\u2019s interest in the \u2018Reality\u2019 branding has been known as far back as 2017, when Bloomberg first reported that Apple was working on \u2018rOS\u2019 or realityOS. In 2019, Apple published a developer framework named \u2018RealityKit\u2019, to help create augmented reality experiences. Of course, there\u2019s no guarantee that Apple uses any of the proposed trademarks, like the Reality One or Reality Pro names. For a start, they haven\u2019t been granted yet. However, you can see the logic. The AR headset would be Apple\u2019s first product in the space, hence Reality One.  Reality Pro is also viable, as the first-generation headset is rumored to be a high-end device \u2014 almost like a tech demo more than mass consumer product \u2014\u00a0with a hefty ~$2000 price tag, if not more. The headset is expected to feature two super high resolution displays, one for each eye, and a bevy of cameras and sensors.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.5440907478,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}
