That represents a healthy 87 percent increase over 2020, when the company handed over 499,550 Teslas to customers. Even better for the company, it ended the year with a bang, racking up a record number of sales in the last quarter of 2021, or 308,600 units. Most of that total consisted of Model 3 and Model Y models, no surprise. It\u2019s the sixth consecutive quarter that it breaks its record for sales. In 2019, the automaker delivered 367,500 units, so annual sales growth, while not exponential, is clearly accelerating. The company has said in the past that one its main goals is to attain 50 percent sales growth year after year. Once upon a time, Tesla struggled mightily to hit its delivery targets, but no more. There\u2019s also no sign of that growth slowing down any time soon, even as all-electric rivals join the market by the month. Projections made by Finbold put estimated sales for 2022 at over 1.5 million units, for an increase of close to 65 percent.

The HFPA ultimately chose to hold the presentation privately, with attendance limited to the organization's beneficiaries, and results announced via press release and highlighted on the Golden Globe Awards' social media pages.  The films Belfast and The Power of the Dog were tied for the most nominations, at seven each. The latter tied with Steven Spielberg's West Side Story and HBO's drama Succession with the most awards of the night, with three each. These included the awards for Best Drama Film, Best Musical or Comedy Film and Best Drama Series, respectively.","Jaccard Noise_20":0.6666666667,"Cosine Noise_20":0.7329716086,"EM Noise_20":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":1,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"Avatar: The Way of Water","Noise_40 Document Index":"5","Noise_40 Document":"Jan 11, 2023 ...

Still, Microsoft does not yet have an affordable, consumer-grade virtual reality headset that would be necessary to fulfill the vision for the metaverse.

The codename of these new AR headsets is\u00a0Project Iris and Google may use a similar type of outer camera technology. The outward cameras on the headsets will blend computer graphics with a feed of the real world. The headset from Google will work wirelessly and doesn\u2019t require any tethered connection as per the reports. Moreover, Project Iris will feature the Silicon technology chipset from the last year\u2019s announced Pixel 6 smartphone.

Furthermore, the specific chipset used on the headsets is the GS101 chipset; however, the graphic-intensive visuals are sourced from a different point. This means the headset requires an active internet connection; that receives the data from the data centers that remotely render graphics.

The glasses, known internally by the codename Iris, were shelved earlier this year following layoffs, reshuffles, and the departure of Clay Bavor, Google's chief of augmented and virtual reality, according to three people familiar with the matter. A Google spokesperson declined to comment. The Verge first reported on the existence of Project Iris in January 2022, describing the device as resembling a pair of ski goggles. However, Google employees said the \"ski goggles\" were actually the foundations of a separate AR project that's since been announced as a partner product with Samsung, while Iris was a series of devices more closely resembling eyeglasses. Google planned to build and launch Iris as its own product, and it shored up talent through acquisitions. In 2020, the company announced it had purchased North, a Canadian startup that made AR glasses.

A new report sheds light on the matter and describes a radical new direction. Hololens 3 halted, internal disputes, and departing professionals: A report from Business Insider last week painted a chaotic picture of what's going on within Microsoft's mixed reality division. Its head Alex Kipman dismissed the rumors on Twitter without denying that Hololens 3 had been discontinued. Now the website has published another report with new insider information about Microsoft's augmented reality future plans. The source claims to know the company's product roadmap and calls Kipman's account of the situation \"complete bullshit.\" Project Calypso, the codename under which Hololens 3 was being developed, has definitely been stopped, he says. \"All of the people who were working on it have been distributed to other programs or have left the company,\" the source said. Microsoft could take Hololens 2 and release a new version with minor improvements, but that would no longer be Calypso. The AR glasses should have been a standalone Windows-based device like its two predecessors, but more robust, with longer battery life and with the ability to be worn outdoors. Microsoft had discontinued Project Calypso in order to devote the freed-up resources to other projects, including Project Bondi, which it was pushing with Samsung. That device is planned as \"a set of displays in a headset\" that uses a Samsung smartphone as a feed, he said.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.3333333333,"Cosine Noise_100":0.3224512339,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

Russia's President Vladimir Putin has given varying public explanations for why he launched the invasion. Here are the reasons Putin gave, how they match with reality, and the other likely reasons why Russia sent its armed forces into an independent, sovereign nation. Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union, before declaring itself an independent country, cementing the move in a referendum days before the USSR collapsed in December 1991. The country has maintained its independence ever since. But Putin still refers to Ukraine as Russian, and denies it's a nation in its own right. He told then-US President George W. Bush in 2008 that Ukraine wasn't even a country. Stephen Hall, a Russian politics expert at the University of Bath in the UK, said many Russians still hold this view, and that \"it isn't just the Kremlin.\" Hall said Russia sees Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, as the \"mother of Russian cities,\" and for Putin he can't have that being outside his own country. Hall added that Russia needs to claim Ukraine in order to back up its argument to being a great power that has existed for millennia. Without it \"Russia can't claim a thousand years of history because Kyiv was already in existence 1,200 years ago, when Moscow was a forest,\" he said.","Jaccard Noise_20":0.6666666667,"Cosine Noise_20":0.8160431981,"EM Noise_20":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":1,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"Feb. 24","Noise_40 Document Index":"0","Noise_40 Document":"Subscribe to Here\u2019s the Deal, our politics                  newsletter for analysis you won\u2019t find anywhere\u00a0else.

Before Apple silicon, Macs used multiple chips for CPU, I\/O, and security, but Apple's effort to integrate these chips is the reason why the M2 is much faster and more efficient than Intel chips. The unified memory architecture that Apple has included is also a major factor because all of the technologies in the M2 are able to access the same data without having to swap between multiple pools of memory.

The M2 chip is built upon the new second-generation 5nm architecture, with Apple claiming it offers an 18% CPU performance increase on the existing M1 processor.  But just because this is Apple\u2019s latest chip for Macs, it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the most powerful. Just like the M1 chip, the M2 is designed for entry-level devices such as the  MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro. And with an 8-core CPU, the M2 chip isn\u2019t as powerful as the likes of the M1 Pro and M1 Max, which are found in the 14-inch an 16-inch MacBook Pro laptops.  Keep reading on for everything you need to know about the new M2 chip.  The Apple M2 chip debuted inside both the MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro, both of which launched in Summer 2022.  At launch, the cheapest device with the M2 will be the MacBook Air at $1199\/\u00a31249 \u2013 and at that price, you only get an 8-core GPU. You\u2019ll need to pay an extra \u00a3100 if you want the 10-core GPU.","Jaccard Noise_80":0.0,"Cosine Noise_80":0.6042410731,"EM Noise_80":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":0,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"June 2022","Noise_100 Document Index":"5","Noise_100 Document":"Apple in June 2022 unveiled the M2, its next-generation Apple silicon chip that followed the M1 chip.

By Radhika Seth The 2022 Oscars were historic to say the least: Apple TV+\u2019s life-affirming CODA became the first film released by a streaming service to win best picture; its raucous star Troy Kotsur became the first deaf man to secure an acting Oscar; West Side Story\u2019s Ariana DeBose became the first openly queer woman of color to scoop best supporting actress; and, before he took home best actor, Will Smith was involved in a jaw-dropping viral moment which will be remembered for decades to come. So, what on earth will the 2023 ceremony bring? Here\u2019s everything we know so far. The 95th Academy Awards will be held on Sunday, March 12, 2023. The Oscars ceremony will air live on ABC from 8:00pm ET, as well as on streaming services including Hulu Live TV, YouTubeTV, and FuboTV. For red carpet arrivals, tune in to E! at 5:00pm Eastern.

A panel of 13 experts were invited to a virtual meeting which took place on 27 March 2021. The proceedings were organised in the sub-sections diagnosis, debridement, infection control, dressings, grafting, pain management, oxygen treatment, outcomes and future needs. Eighty percent or better concurrence among the panellists was considered a consensus. A large number of critical questions were discussed and agreed upon. Important takeaways included that wound care needs to be simplified to a point that it can be delivered by the patient or the patient's family. Another one was that telemonitoring, which has proved very useful during the COVID-19 pandemic, can help reduce the frequency of interventions by a visiting nurse or a wound care center.

Semiconductor shortages derailed the post-COVID recovery, affecting vehicle sales worldwide. But the shortages have eased a bit one year later and auto sales are reviving. Automakers expect to recover the losses made during the last two years, soon. However, traditional automakers are unable to cope with the rising demand for pure EVs, whereas Tesla\u2019s ability to address this demand has rewarded it not only with higher vehicle sales in Q1 2022 but also a record revenue of $18.8 billion. Tesla has also started deliveries to car rental service provider Hertz against its huge 100,000-vehicle order, which is also a reason for high vehicle production and delivery during the quarter. Tesla\u2019s Q1 2022 revenue would have been more without the fresh COVID wave that has hit Shanghai and surrounding areas, affecting the company\u2019s production there. From the second week of March, rising cases of a new COVID variant have forced automakers operating around Shanghai to suspend production. The urge to achieve L4 autonomy by the end of 2023 and to roll out robotaxis by early 2025 can be a major reason for Tesla\u2019s big R&D spend. Besides, Tesla could also be conducting research on developing new battery chemistry.

However, between March and May 2022 the shares fell sharply, and they have only been able to recover a small portion of those declines since. As of July 27, Amazon shares have provided a 1-year trailing total return of -34.7%, below the S&P 500's return of -10.9%.   Amazon has posted strong EPS growth in recent years, rising 81.7% in FY 2020 and 53.2% in FY 2021. Earnings declined in only two of the last nine quarters. However, Amazon's solid EPS growth sharply reversed course last quarter. The company posted a loss of $0.39 per share for Q1 FY 2022, the first time Amazon has seen a quarterly loss in several years. While analysts don't predict another loss for Q2 FY 2022, they nonetheless expect a drastic decline in EPS.   Amazon's revenue growth has also fallen in recent quarters, though not as dramatically. In Q2 FY 2018, the company reported a 39.3% YOY revenue gain. This slowed to 19.9% for Q2 FY 2019 before increasing again to 40.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.3350058198,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

They were essentially treated as disposable.  Now on-set animal action, in the United States at least, is monitored by the nonprofit American Humane. Plus, animals on screen are increasingly computer-generated images or motion capture marvels that fuse digital imagery with human actors, as was the case in the award-winning rebooted Planet of the Apes trilogy starring Andy Serkis as the lead chimpanzee, Caesar. We have both reformed and replaced animals\u2019 work in the making of entertainment. Horses and chimpanzees are now often placed on opposite sides of a perceived line between accepted and unacceptable animal use.

Nope is an original, atypical alien film that uses the mode of otherworldly forces to explore the idea of the spectacle and \u201cthe good and the bad that come from this idea of attention.\u201d The first notion of the spectacle that Peele introduces in Nope is the discussion surrounding the first moving picture ever created by Eadweard Muybridge in the 19th century. This is mentioned because the black jockey that was riding the horse in those photographs has been seen by all but goes unnamed throughout history, while the white photographer lives in infamy. The even more personal connection to this is that the jockey was the great-great-great grandfather of Nope\u2019s two protagonists, siblings OJ Haywood (Daniel Kaluuya) and Emerald Haywood (Keke Palmer).

In many cases, when asked to explain its logic, GPT-4 will give explanations that directly contradict its previous statements.[16]","Jaccard Noise_60":0.25,"Cosine Noise_60":0.8749492764,"EM Noise_60":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_60":0,"Noise_80 Predicted Answer":"Mar 14, 2023","Noise_80 Document Index":"2","Noise_80 Document":"Mar 14, 2023 ...

Zen 4 and AM5, meanwhile, promise meaningful architectural changes. You'll see more Level 2 cache, boost speeds beyond 5GHz, AI hardware acceleration and support for newer standards like DDR5 memory and PCIe 5.0 expansion.

The increase follows several others, including one just months ago, when the cost rose from $10,000 to $12,000. This latest hike is tied to a software update (FSD Beta 10.69.2), which improves overall driving smoothness through turns, enhances pedestrian and animal detection, and enables a creep-into-intersection function. Full Self-Driving is Tesla\u2019s disingenuously named suite of advanced driver-assistance features. Currently, it includes all the functionality of Basic and Enhanced Autopilot, plus the ability to slow the vehicle to a stop as it approaches red traffic signals and signs. If you see little importance or utility in the last of those things, you can still get the bulk of Tesla\u2019s magic with Enhanced Autopilot. It costs a relative bargain, at $6,000, and gives your vehicle the ability to park itself and navigate a highway route from on-ramp to off-ramp (including automatic lane changes) with minimal driver involvement. It also includes Summon, which allows the driver to direct a car into or out of a tight parking space while standing outside the vehicle, and Smart Summon, which enables the vehicle to wind its way around objects (such as in a parking lot) to meet the driver.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.9999999404,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"$15,000","Noise_20 Document Index":"6","Noise_20 Document":"The move raises the price by $3,000, which amounts to a 25% hike.  Tesla is raising the price of its \"Full Self Driving\" software to $15,000, Elon Musk said in a tweet on Sunday. Tesla is facing scrutiny from federal and state officials over how it has advertised its self-driving technology, as well as concern over safety risks involved with the self-driving capability. Customers who order the Full Self Driving, or FSD, software before Sept. 5 will receive the product under the current price, Musk, Tesla's CEO, said in the tweet. The $3K price bump arrives as Tesla introduces FSD beta 10.69, a new iteration that boasts \"improved overall driving smoothness\" and \"reduced false slowdowns near crosswalks,\" according to the company. The FSD software doesn't make a car fully self-driving. Rather, users must remain focused on the road and keep their hands on the driving wheel. The Autopilot system, meanwhile, offers navigation to and from user-provided destinations, as well as suggestions for lane changes and other maneuvers to optimize a trip. Tesla has come under sharp criticism over its marketing of the FSD software and Autopilot. Earlier this month, the California Department of Motor Vehicles alleged that the company deceptively advertises the products as fully autonomous, according to two filings with California's Office of Administrative Hearings. The filings were first reported by The Los Angeles Times.","Jaccard Noise_20":1.0,"Cosine Noise_20":0.9999999404,"EM Noise_20":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":1,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"$15,000","Noise_40 Document Index":"4","Noise_40 Document":"The promised functionality of these driver-assist packages is more modest.

On this page, we're bringing you the latest PSVR 2 news updates including the PSVR2 price, release date and pre-order info. It goes without saying, this new VR headset will be in high demand and you'll need to be quick if you want to get one on its launch date.

So far the only VR headsets that are wireless as standard are standalone models like the Meta Quest 2, which are by their nature less powerful. HTC has released wireless add-ons for the Vive and Vive Cosmos, but doesn\u2019t support wireless play as standard \u2013 perhaps Sony will take a similar approach and release a wireless adapter post-launch. For a while Sony was playing coy about the silicon inside the PS VR2, but in November 2022 it was announced that MediaTek is providing the chips that power both the headset and the Sense controllers. These are both custom chips, designed in collaboration between MediaTek and Sony, and neither company has revealed much about the specific silicon, but at least we have a name for it. Remember that the bulk of the processing power comes from the PS5 itself though, with MediaTek\u2019s chip only handling things like the displays, tracking, and connectivity.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.5443759561,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

Matt Leinart won the Heisman in 2004 on the way to a national championship. Bush\u2019s Heisman win, the Trojans\u2019 seventh, was later vacated for NCAA violations that began the descent of USC.

Williams beat out the other three finalists -- Ohio State's C.J. Stroud, TCU's Max Duggan and Georgia's Stetson Bennett -- in what was the first all-quarterback group of Heisman finalists since 2018. Duggan finished second in the voting, receiving 1,420 points to Williams' 2,031. Stroud finished third (539 points) and Bennett fourth (349 points). It marks the 11th time in the last 13 years that a quarterback has won the award. \"To now be a part of this historic fraternity is truly an honor and something I will cherish for the rest of my life,\" Williams said during his acceptance speech at Saturday night's ceremony in New York City. \"While this may be an individual award, I certainly understand that nothing -- and absolutely nothing -- in this sport, nor life, is done alone.\" Williams currently leads the FBS in passing touchdowns (37) and ranks fourth in pass yards (4,075).

Pick your Plasmid and get ready to evolve because the\u00a0BioShock\u00a0movie just found its director.

The Little Sisters are in good hands.\u00a0 The original\u00a0BioShock\u00a0is more than just a superb first-person shooter game.

He continued on, talking about his discussions with Take-Two Interactive and Ken Levine, the man largely responsible for developing the concept for BioShock: There's always discussions about rating and tone. I don't want to get into it too much now because it's pretty early on in the process, but I certainly have not felt stifled in any way, or sent in any directions with Netflix. I mean, basically me and Cameron [MacConomy] who works with me, and Michael are getting to do what we want to do, which is great. A lot of it is staying really true to the game itself, and we're talking to Take-Two [Interactive] and Ken Levine. Despite the confidence, Lawrence is fully aware of how video game movies have failed in the past. Still, he's convinced that BioShock offers something meatier to the table that can survive the jump to the big screen. When asked if he knew about the disconnect in adaptations, he added: No, I do know what you mean. When I think about that, I go back to what we talked about earlier, which is I think that there's some great video games out there, but they don't always have the weight of actual ideas underneath them.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.5,"Cosine Noise_100":0.8792355061,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

With 9.7 million jobs added since President Biden took office and an average of 378,000 per month over the past three months, the economy continues to transition from a historically powerful recovery into steady and stable progress that benefits working families. Job growth in August was broad-based, with significant gains in professional and business services, retail trade, wholesale trade and manufacturing.

{"Query":"What is Trace Adkins' role in \"Monarch\"?","Correct Answer":["Albie Roman"],"Noise_0 Predicted Answer":"country singer","Noise_0 Document Index":"5","Noise_0 Document":"Fox's latest musical drama brings viewers along for the radio in this tale about a fictional country music empire. One of the most recognizable genres of music, country music has seen its fair share of stars and dynasties throughout its years. Fox\u2019s new musical drama Monarch is out to capture the intrigue of the country music scene. The synopsis that Fox provides is tantalizing: Reigning King of Country Music Albie Roman, along with his insanely talented -- and tough as nails -- wife, Queen of Country Music Dottie Cantrell Roman, have created a country music dynasty, but even though the Roman name is synonymous with authenticity, the very foundation of their success is a lie. When their reign as country royalty is put in jeopardy, heir to the crown Nicolette \u201cNicky\u201d Roman will stop at nothing to protect her family\u2019s legacy, while ensuring her own quest for stardom, alongside her brother Luke and sister Gigi. The trailer very much confirms the synopsis. With characters oozing secrets, betrayals, fistfights, guns, bright lights, and country music, there\u2019s enough content here for a whole album\u2019s worth of country music lyrics. Importantly, we are introduced to the major players in the series, most of them members of the Roman family.

The show capped its first season Tuesday night, and while \"Monarch\" opened with a strong rating and ranked as Fox's most-watched fall scripted debut in three years, the following 10 episodes didn't perform as well, Deadline reported. The show created by Melissa London Hilfers was ordered in May 2021 and was intended to launch in January 2022. The debut was scuttled to the fall as a result of the pandemic. \"Monarch\" is a multigenerational country music drama about country music's most influential family -- The Romans. The family is led by tough and talented Dottie Cantrell Roman, played by Sarandon, and her husband Albie, Adkins' character. Sarandon dies in the first episode. The Roman's success is at risk, and the family comes together to protect its legacy and future \u2013 and all costs. Executive producers for the Fox Entertainment-produced series include Hilfers, Gail Berman, Hend Baghdady, and Nashville power manager Jason Owen. \"Right now, we are all living in a really divided country,\" Owen told People when \"Monarch\" debuted. \"When times are tough, you look for something to sort of give you a break from all the noise.","Jaccard Noise_60":0.0,"Cosine Noise_60":0.1716860384,"EM Noise_60":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_60":0,"Noise_80 Predicted Answer":"the husband to Sarandon's","Noise_80 Document Index":"3","Noise_80 Document":"Sep 16, 2022 ...

Naturally, she has her own true crime podcast called Susie Searches, so when fellow student\/meditation influencer Jesse (Alex Wolff) goes missing, her interest in cracking the case isn't exactly selfless. If she finds the internet-adored victim, she and her podcast could score the validation she desperately craves. Whether she's squeezing the sheriff (Jim Gaffigan) for clues, eying a convenient creep (Ken Marino) as a suspect, or scouting out evidence, Susie is on a mission to save the day\u2026and promote herself.\u00a0 Forget the hardscrabble detectives of film noir; Susie has more in common with Oliver Putnam than she does Sam Spade.

The news punctuates an eventful and \u201cstressful\u201d regular season for Busch, whose free agency dominated headlines and clouded a playoff-caliber season in 2022. It did so because his looming free agency revealed a strange reality in NASCAR economics \u2014 that one of the sport\u2019s biggest stars would have to struggle to find a home (even with taking a pay cut) because of something outside of his control. That \u201csomething\u201d outside of his control, in this case, was the result of the Mars Inc. decision to exit NASCAR at the end of the year, leaving Joe Gibbs Racing (Busch\u2019s current team) without a primary sponsor for Busch\u2019s No. 18 team. Busch confirmed to reporters earlier this month that he had \u201cmore than one\u201d team extend official contract offers to him. RCR was among those companies, per reports at the time.

The two-time NASCAR Cup Series champion will leave Joe Gibbs Racing after a 15-year tenure that saw Busch become one of the greatest drivers of his generation as well as one of the greatest in NASCAR history, earning 56 of his 60 career victories behind the wheel of a Gibbs Toyota.

The overall diversity of the tutorial organizers and potential audience will be taken into account to ensure that the conference program is varied and balanced.  Tutorial proposals should describe and will be evaluated according to how the tutorial contributes to topics promoting diversity (e.g., working on minority languages, developing NLP for good), participation diversity (e.g., coordinating with social affinity groups, providing subsidies, making a promotional plan for the tutorial), and representation diversity among tutorial presenters.

Her death was publicly announced at 18:30. She was succeeded by her eldest son, Charles III.  The death of Queen Elizabeth II set in motion Operation London Bridge, a collection of plans including arrangements for her state funeral, and supported by Operation Unicorn, which set protocols for her death occurring in Scotland. The United Kingdom observed a national mourning period of 10 days. The Queen's lying in state took place in Westminster Hall from 14 to 19\u00a0September, during which time an estimated 250,000 people queued to pay their respects.  Elizabeth's state funeral on 19 September was the first held in Britain since Winston Churchill's in 1965. A funeral service was held at Westminster Abbey, followed by a procession to Wellington Arch that featured around 3,000 military personnel and was watched by around a million people in central London. The state hearse then transported the Queen's coffin to Windsor, followed by another procession through Windsor Great Park and a committal service at St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle.","Jaccard Noise_40":0.3333333333,"Cosine Noise_40":0.8206947446,"EM Noise_40":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":0,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"Westminster Abbey","Noise_60 Document Index":"2","Noise_60 Document":"The State Funeral of Queen Elizabeth II will take place at Westminster Abbey on Monday 19th September at 11am.

Queen Elizabeth II funeral live updates::News from the queen's funeral as it unfolds About 15 minutes before the service starts, the queen's Royal Standard-draped coffin topped with the Orb and the Scepter will be moved by the State Gun Carriage of the Royal Navy\u00a0(the same carriage that carried the coffin of her father, King George VI)\u00a0from Westminster Hall, where it has been lying in state since Wednesday night, to Westminster Abbey. That procession, led by King Charles III and his siblings, will look very much like the procession to take the coffin from Buckingham Palace to Westminster Hall on Wednesday, but shorter.

Giorgia Meloni, leader of Fratelli d'Italia (Brothers of Italy), will become the first female prime minister in Italy\u2019s history. Her election last month will move the country to the far right for the first time since Benito Mussolini\u2019s fall during World War II. The Brothers of Italy, which was founded by Meloni, is a national-conservative populist party that opposes undocumented immigration, according to its website. Meloni\u2019s victory now means uncertainty for those who migrated to Italy. When Baryali Waiz, a refugee in Italy, heard the results of the general election, he said he was worried. \u201cWhat happens when voters can\u2019t find work? They blame migrants,\u201d Waiz told ABC News. As of August, Italy\u2019s unemployment rate stood at 8.1%, the third highest in the European Union after Spain and Greece. Clamping down on immigration was a key part of Meloni\u2019s campaign. Though she softened her rhetoric before the election, Meloni pledged stricter border controls and proposed establishing European Union-managed centers to analyze asylum applications. There are about 5 million foreign-born residents in Italy, making up less than 9% of the country\u2019s total population of 59.2 million, according to the country\u2019s most recent census data.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.9999998808,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Giorgia Meloni","Noise_20 Document Index":"3","Noise_20 Document":"Populist firebrand Giorgia Meloni has been named as Italy\u2019s first female prime minister, becoming the country\u2019s most far-right leader since Benito Mussolini.

Giorgia Meloni, leader of Fratelli d'Italia (Brothers of Italy), will become the first female prime minister in Italy\u2019s history. Her election last month will move the country to the far right for the first time since Benito Mussolini\u2019s fall during World War II. The Brothers of Italy, which was founded by Meloni, is a national-conservative populist party that opposes undocumented immigration, according to its website. Meloni\u2019s victory now means uncertainty for those who migrated to Italy. When Baryali Waiz, a refugee in Italy, heard the results of the general election, he said he was worried. \u201cWhat happens when voters can\u2019t find work? They blame migrants,\u201d Waiz told ABC News. As of August, Italy\u2019s unemployment rate stood at 8.1%, the third highest in the European Union after Spain and Greece. Clamping down on immigration was a key part of Meloni\u2019s campaign. Though she softened her rhetoric before the election, Meloni pledged stricter border controls and proposed establishing European Union-managed centers to analyze asylum applications. There are about 5 million foreign-born residents in Italy, making up less than 9% of the country\u2019s total population of 59.2 million, according to the country\u2019s most recent census data.","Jaccard Noise_60":1.0,"Cosine Noise_60":0.9999998808,"EM Noise_60":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_60":1,"Noise_80 Predicted Answer":"Meloni","Noise_80 Document Index":"0","Noise_80 Document":"On 25 October, Meloni gave her first official speech as Prime Minister in front of the Chamber of Deputies, before the confidence vote on her cabinet.[132][133] During her speech, she stressed the weight of being the first woman to serve as head of the Italian government.[134] She thanked several Italian women including Tina Anselmi, Samantha Cristoforetti, Grazia Deledda, Oriana Fallaci, Nilde Iotti, Rita Levi-Montalcini, and Maria Montessori, who she said, \"with the boards of their own examples, built the ladder that today allows me to climb and break the heavy glass ceiling placed over our heads\".[135][136] The government won the confidence vote with a comfortable majority in both houses.[137][138]  One of the first measures implemented by the government regarded COVID-19 and concerned with the complete removal of the COVID-19 vaccination certificate, known in Italy as the Green Pass; moreover, non-vaccinated doctors were re-integrated into service.[139] By this time, the government\u2019s workforce vaccination mandate had been in place for over one year, rendering the edict largely symbolic.

Last year, NBC refused to air the show at all, saying that the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the troubled organization at the center of the scandal, needed time to make \u201cmeaningful reform.\u201d But on Tuesday, the 80th annual Golden Globe Awards are back on NBC with a show that will attempt to win the trust of viewers and participants.

Abe went into cardiopulmonary arrest at the site of the shooting and was rushed to hospital in a state of cardiac arrest at 12:20 p.m. local time, doctors said.

The installment flashes further forward into the future than ever before and ages its characters up so severely that they may as well be entirely different people. And that\u2019s not even to mention the nearly dozen actually new characters that the episode does introduce in the form of Queen Alicent, Princess Rhaenyra, and Prince Daemon\u2019s respective broods of children.\u00a0 The decision to jump so far down the timeline midseason is as bold a one as you\u2019re likely to see on television. It has every reason to be a disastrous one as well. Shuffling the board to this extent halfway through a story shouldn\u2019t work. And yet, work \u201cThe Princess and The Queen\u201d does.

House of the Dragon is down to its final four episodes, and should the series continue to release on a weekly basis, the rest of the season should air as follows: Though Alicent and Rhaenyra were at the center of Episode 6, the marriage between Daemon (Matt Smith) and Laena resulted in the fiery death of House Velaryon\u2019s eldest daughter. Her early demise will have consequences, considering Episode 7 is titled, \u201cDriftmark,\u201d which is the seat of House Velaryon. Expect plenty from Corlys (Steve Toussaint) and Rhaenys (Eve Best), who\u2019ll be trying to pick up the pieces following their daughter\u2019s death. Episode 6 had one of the longest runtimes of the season, totaling 67 minutes. With so much to cover across the 10-year gap, a little extra time seemed necessary. But Episode 7 will serve as the shortest episode in the series so far, slated for just under an hour at 59 minutes. Episode 7 will likely revolve around the Velaryons in Driftmark. As we\u2019ve seen in the trailer, viewers will see the funeral for Laena.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":-0.0150782578,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

The Norse realms seem even harsher in God of War Ragnar\u00f6k. After years of anticipation and no concrete information since September 2021, fans are desperate to get their hands on this sequel. Sony finally saw fit to shed some more light on the project in a recent blog post. The story seems to pick up shortly after its predecessor leaves off, with Kratos and Atreus asking all the same questions fans have been wondering about since that cliffhanger finale. Here's everything you need to know about God of War Ragnar\u00f6k. Kratos and Atreus will continue their adventure in 'God of War Ragnarok.' After getting pushed back from an original release window of 2021, and a long time waiting, the official release date for God of War Ragnar\u00f6k is November 9, 2022. The announcement was made on the PlayStation blog along with a snazzy new trailer. As happy as many people are to see the game finally get an official release, it comes after a wave of intense harassment that the developers at Sony Santa Monica faced. Some developers even shared that they were being sent unsolicited Dick Pics due to the game not revealing a release date.  Yes, Sony Santa Monica revealed a three-minute trailer that goes into quite a bit of detail about the story of God of War Ragnar\u00f6k. In addition, a CG trailer was released along with the game's release date announcement.

It allows players to take customized in-game screenshots adjusting, among other things, the field of view, depth of view, filters, and the visibility and facial expressions of most major characters.[65] A New Game Plus mode was added in update patch 4.00 on April 5, 2023.

He went to the boarding school Winchester College, then studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Oxford, and business at Stanford in America. He is now the first British Asian prime minister. Mr Sunak was first elected as an MP in 2015 - for Richmond in north Yorkshire - but rose quickly, and was made finance minister - or chancellor - in February 2020 under Boris Johnson.

The streaming giant on Thursday is rolling out its cheapest membership tier, dubbed \"Basic With Ads.\" The new tier will cost $6.99 per month, which makes it a full $3 cheaper than Netflix's current cheapest plan, the $9.99 Basic plan. It's Netflix's first foray into the ad-supported space \u2014 the streamer has for years resisted putting any advertising on its platform. The company's plan arrives on Nov. 3, a month before rival streaming service Disney+ will introduce its own ad-supported tier, and competes with ad-supported plans from services like Hulu and Peacock. The plan's launch comes as Netflix is preparing to crack down on password sharing on its platform. Beginning next year, Netflix will push people who borrow accounts to create their own, and will also give account-holders who share their passwords the ability to pay extra to have friends and family on their accounts. Here's what you need to know about Netflix's Basic With Ads tier. The Basic With Ads plan will operate similarly to the Basic plan. Users will have access to a 720p video stream \u2014 versus the 1080p stream offered by the $15.49 Standard plan and the 4K plan offered by the $19.99 Premium plan \u2014 which can be accessed from any internet-connected device.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.3333333333,"Cosine Noise_0":0.5771024227,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"$6.99 per month","Noise_20 Document Index":"2","Noise_20 Document":"Things you buy through our links may earn\u00a0Vox Media\u00a0a commission.

The era of huge budgets and endless hubris came to an end as the rent came due all at once. In spring and summer, Netflix, the leader in the space, hemorrhaged users for the first time in ten years, prompting a stock swoon, a swath of layoffs, and a moratorium on the blank checks the company used to dole out to Hollywood needle movers. (Sorry, Bright 2, we hardly knew you.) Plenty of analysts have tried to evaluate exactly what went wrong, and most lay the blame on a combination of a middling slate of original programming and a newfound national stinginess in the face of rising inflation. Thankfully, Netflix has humbled itself to address at least one of those issues with a new payment plan it put into action this autumn. For a teensy $6.99 per month, anyone can pay for a Netflix subscription \u2026 as long as they\u2019re willing to sit through a few commercials during playback.

Going into the 2022 midterm elections, Democrats knew historic trends would favor that the party out of power gains seats. House Democrats' razor-thin five-seat majority, plus a significant number of retirements by veteran members, set up an uphill battle for them to retain power. Yet despite those historical headwinds, Democrats did much better than expected in this year's midterms and kept control of the Senate.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.6566407681,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":0,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Democrats","Noise_20 Document Index":"2","Noise_20 Document":"This video can not be played Watch: Time for Republicans to decide 'who they are' - Biden The Democrats will retain majority control of the US Senate after winning a pivotal race in the state of Nevada. Senator Catherine Cortez Masto is projected to defeat Republican challenger Adam Laxalt, who was backed by former President Donald Trump. The results amount to the best midterm performance for a sitting party in 20 years. US President Joe Biden said he was incredibly pleased, and it was time for Republicans to decide \"who they are\". Democratic Senate Majority leader, Chuck Schumer, said the results showed the American people had rejected what he called the \"violent rhetoric\" of the Republican Party. The Democrats will now have 50 Senate seats, with Republicans currently on 49. The remaining seat, Georgia, is going to a run-off in December. In the event of the Senate being divided equally between the two parties, Vice-President Kamala Harris has the casting vote. Republicans could still take control of the US House of Representatives as votes continue to be tallied from a handful of districts after Tuesday's elections. If the Republicans win the House they could still thwart much of Mr Biden's agenda.  \"I'm not surprised by the turnout. I'm incredibly pleased.

In 2020, that worked to their advantage, and Democrats gained control of the chamber. In 2018, Democrats spent more, but the GOP gained House majority. Voter turnout is typically much lower in non-presidential elections. Since the 1980s, midterm voter turnout has hovered around 40%, whereas presidential cycles have reached over 60%. However, turnout during the Trump administration was high, particularly in the 2018 midterm election, which gave Nancy Pelosi her second stint as Speaker of the House. But because the stakes of the midterms were high this year, we saw more people turning up to the booths. After the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, Democrats used abortion rights to win special elections in places like New York\u2019s Hudson Valley, in addition to flipping Alaska\u2019s lone House seat. Republicans, on the other hand, pointed to high inflation rates, government spending, and crime rates, which ultimately drove many voters to cast their ballots for the GOP. Post-Dobbs, Democrats banked on voters supporting abortion rights in order to maintain control of the House. However, in keeping with midterm trends, Republicans were projected to make a net gain of five seats to bring them into the House majority.","Jaccard Noise_40":0.0,"Cosine Noise_40":0.6566407681,"EM Noise_40":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":0,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"Democrats","Noise_60 Document Index":"0","Noise_60 Document":"This projection was based on a variety of metrics, including generic ballot testing that favored a Republican-led Congress as well as President Biden\u2019s low approval rating, which hovers around 40%. Super PACS and political party groups were spending money almost exclusively in districts that President Biden won in 2020, indicating that Democrats were in a defensive crouch. Midterm elections often benefit the opposition political party at the expense of the White House\u2019s party. 1994 and 2010 were typical midterm elections, where Republicans made gains in the House at the midpoint of Bill Clinton and Barack Obama\u2019s first terms. Similarly, in 2018, Republican\u2019s got crushed in House elections but picked up two seats in the Senate. If a president\u2019s approval ratings are high, then the presiding party typically fares better in midterm House elections. For example, in 1998, Bill Clinton\u2019s approval rating was 66%, and Democrats retained control of the House. In 2002, George W. Bush polled at a 63%, and Republicans made gains. Currently, Biden\u2019s approval rating is 42%, which is similar to former president Barack Obama\u2019s rating in 2010. That year, Democrats lost control of the House, similar to what occurred during this year\u2019s midterms. After each census, congressional district lines are redrawn.

It has been a while since the profilers' last on-screen case, but the characters' stories continued during that period. Granted that revival retcons the Criminal Minds finale in several ways, it's essentially the same thing. That being said, Paramount+ just cannot simply use the title Criminal Minds season 16 because the project is different in a couple of significant ways from its original run. That includes veering away from its episodic storytelling format to a more serialized one, not to mention being darker and more disturbing than CBS' iteration. By giving the Criminal Minds revival a new title, Paramount+ allows it to be both a reboot and a continuation of the CBS series. Calling it Criminal Minds season 16 could also be confusing if the project doesn\u2019t address every single plot line that the finale left loose, which puts a lot of burden on the new series. Having its official title of Criminal Minds: Evolution quickly establishes that the show is part of the Criminal Minds brand, which could entice some formers fans to check it out, especially those who haven\u2019t been keeping track of Paramount+\u2019s efforts to bring back the BAU on the small screen.

Still playing without injured Neymar, the Brazilians couldn't muster much against a Cameroon side looking to keep their hopes alive. A 92nd-minute goal by Vincent Aboubakar (who was then sent off for taking his shirt off in celebration) gave the African side a small chance, but Switzerland's 3-2 win over Serbia in the concurrent match ensured the Swiss would advance. Brazil lost their first group stage match since 1998, and with no teams winning the maximum nine points for the first time since 1994, it's a fitting way to end what's been a wild start to the World Cup.

Cheboi grew up in grinding poverty in rural Kenya. \"I never forgot what it was like with my stomach churning because of hunger at night,\" even though her mother \"worked really hard to educate us,\" she said on CNN Sunday. Online voters selected Cheboi as the top winner from a field of 10 heroes. On a full scholarship at Augustana College in Illinois, she \"fell in love\" with computer science and knew she had found her career path. It wasn't until she began working in the software industry, however, that she realized that companies just throw away computers when it's time for an update.

The inequities between the men and women were obvious and stark, which put the NCAA into damage-control mode. At that point, those in the women's basketball world had to question if Emmert was very sincere in his concern, but there was a \"better-late-than-never\" sentiment. And the NCAA's decision to commission the so-called Kaplan report, which did a deep dive into inequities in all men's and women's NCAA championships, was an important step because it didn't pull any punches about how significant those issues have been. The report also said the NCAA has been selling women's sports short regarding potential television revenue. When it's time to negotiate TV rights again, rather than selling multiple championships in a bargain bundle, the NCAA needs to think bigger about the worth of each championship and how best to maximize revenue from it. Also, the NCAA has to show more leadership regarding the inclusion of transgender athletes in competition. As with so many things, the NCAA has been behind on this. Dave Wilson: The next leader is going to have to get creative to figure out the mess of issues currently embroiling college sports, or finally just step out of the way and put on tournaments.

View all partners In winning the 2023 Academy Award for best animated feature, director Guillermo del Toro\u2019s Pinocchio continues its remarkable run of accolades, from the Golden Globes to the Baftas. Del Toro has used the platform afforded by his nominations to champion the medium of animation as true cinema, proclaiming in his Bafta award speech:  Animation is not a genre for kids. It\u2019s a medium for art, it\u2019s a medium for film and I think animation should stay in the conversation. His rendition of Pinocchio has certainly started a conversation, not least in gaining an impressive audience on Netflix. His film demonstrates that in the right creative environment \u2013 and with an innovator at the helm \u2013 a well-worn narrative, such as Pinocchio, can evolve. Such revitalisation of the Pinocchio story was in part possible because \u2013 as he says himself \u2013 del Toro didn\u2019t craft his retelling solely with children in mind.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.25,"Cosine Noise_100":0.738961339,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

As Zack Snyder\u2019s sci-fi epic Rebel Moon heads to Netflix, here\u2019s everything you need to know from its release date and trailer to cast, plot, and more. Director Zack Snyder is known for his stint in the DCEU, with movies such as Man of Steel, Batman v Superman, and Zack Snyder\u2019s Justice League. Now, after leaving the DCEU behind, Snyder has teamed up with Netflix for an assortment of projects, including Army of the Dead and the forthcoming Rebel Moon.  The movie has already drawn comparisons to that of the Star Wars franchise and is shaping up to be one of 2023\u2019s hottest blockbusters, and a major holiday hit for the streaming platform. So, if you\u2019re like us, you\u2019ll want to be updated with all things Rebel Moon. Here\u2019s everything you need to know.  Rebel Moon will premiere on Netflix on December 22, 2023. The two-part space epic began filming on April 19, 2022, and wrapped on December 2.  Filmed back-to-back, Zack Snyder\u2019s foray into space warfare will also be released in theaters for a limited time. Initially, the early concept for the film was pitched as an Akira Kurosawa-inspired adventure to Star Wars executives during the prequel era, but ultimately transformed into the Netflix space opera we know today.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.6666666667,"Cosine Noise_0":0.8899132609,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"December 22, 2023","Noise_20 Document Index":"0","Noise_20 Document":"11] On May 16, 2022, it was announced that Ed Skrein has replaced Friend as the film's main antagonist due to scheduling conflicts, with Cleopatra Coleman, Fra Fee and Rhian Rees joining the project.[12] On June 8, 2022, it was announced that Anthony Hopkins had joined the cast as the voice of Jimmy, an impossibly sentient JC1435 mechanized battle robot and one-time defender of the slain King.[13]  Filming commenced as of April 19, 2022,[14] with Snyder sharing the first images from the set on Twitter that day.[15] Snyder also served as cinematographer.[1] It ran until December 2,[16] with 152 days of filming taking place in California, to tap into $83 million in qualified spending and tax incentives.[17]  Rebel Moon Part 1 and Rebel Moon Part 2 will receive both a PG-13 cut and an extended, R-rated cut.[18]  In January 2023, Tom Holkenborg was revealed to be composing the score.

By the end of 2023, Zack Snyder will be back behind the camera for Rebel Moon. The fan-favorite director will test his skills in an epic space opera heading to Netflix later this year. Here\u2019s all the information we know about the Rebel Moon release date. Netflix set the Rebel Moon release date for December 22, 2023. One of the most-anticipated movies in 2023, Rebel Moon was penned by Snyder, Shay Hatten, and Kurt Johnstad. Snyder has directed many movies that can be labeled as sci-fi, proof is his long commitment to the DC Universe superheroes in what was nicknamed the \u201cSnyderverse.\u201d However, Space Moon will be his first space opera. The 57-year-old director started his partnership with Netflix with 2021\u2019s Army of the Dead, a zombie movie that featured an epic heist.  Inspired by Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa and Star Wars, Rebel Moon follows a peaceful colony dealing with an oppressive regent. Still, many details are under wrap, and the movie hasn\u2019t even got a trailer. Yet, Netflix believes so very much in the Rebel Moon potential of the film that a sequel is being filmed back-to-back. Originally, Snyder approached Lucasfilm with his story, but the project never sailed there. Instead, it took the current form after the involvement of producer Eric Newman.","Jaccard Noise_40":0.6666666667,"Cosine Noise_40":0.8899132609,"EM Noise_40":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":1,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"December 22, 2023","Noise_60 Document Index":"1","Noise_60 Document":"ReleaseEdit.

The character wears his comic book character's signature red outfit with a white cape and lightning bolt on his chest. Shazam, originally named Captain Marvel, was at one point the most popular superhero in the world and even outsold Superman comics. The character has the potential to be a major part of the DCU; if the sequel does well, there's little doubt he can fit him into James Gunn and Peter Safran's new plans for the franchise. Freddy Freeman is Billy's physically disabled foster brother and also the first person to learn that Billy has superpowers. Freddy is an expert on all things superheroes and helps Billy learn more about his powers. Freddy Freeman's adult form, formerly known as Captain Marvel Jr. in the comics, wears a blue super suit and has a great deal of flight power, which is fitting because that was the superpower he told Billy he wished he could have. One of the most courageous members of the group (representing Achilles), his kid form is played by Jack Dylan Grazer, while his adult form is played by Adam Brody.

As of Friday, the Iowa Department of Education says it has received 15,538 applications for an Educational Savings Account, or ESA, to provide state funding for a student to attend a private K-12 school. A Legislative Services Agency analysis projected 14,068 would enroll in the first year of the program. The application period runs through June 30th, meaning the number of applications will likely continue to grow. If all of those applications are approved, the taxpayer cost for the program would likely exceed the $107 million dollars estimate for this coming school year. It would also likely mean a larger-than-expected loss in funding to public schools due to students enrolling instead in a private institution. State funding to public schools is based on enrollment, so fewer enrolled students would mean less funding from the state. Governor Reynolds\u2019 voucher program aimed to offset at least some of that by giving districts $1,176 per student who lives in a district and enrolls in a private school. The state declined to provide demographic data on the applications so far, citing the ongoing application period. That means it\u2019s unclear yet how many of the applications are from public school students.","Jaccard Noise_80":0.0,"Cosine Noise_80":0.5026684999,"EM Noise_80":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":0,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"$1,205 per pupil","Noise_100 Document Index":"4","Noise_100 Document":"PowerPoint for Families Spanish Application Training Webinar Recording for Families - Recorded 5-26-23.\u00a0Spanish PowerPoint for Families Iowa\u2019s Students First Act ESA Program: Eligible and Ineligible Expenses 2023-24 Iowa Nonpublic School Building Directory This webpage will be updated as new information is available.

{"Query":"What is Google's new AI chatbot called?","Correct Answer":["Bard"],"Noise_0 Predicted Answer":"Bard","Noise_0 Document Index":"3","Noise_0 Document":"Google set a high bar for its new artificial intelligence chatbot Bard. It shares a nickname with William Shakespeare. But this Bard, released Tuesday, hasn\u2019t advanced the state of the art just yet. Google\u2019s Bard is an AI trained on trillions of words from the internet that you\u2019re supposed to be able to converse with like a buddy. I was among the first to get access at Bard\u2019s debut, and spent the day chatting and asking it questions suggested by Post readers to my email inbox. What I learned is that Google doesn\u2019t seem to know what Bard is good for, which is one reason it\u2019s releasing Bard slowly as a public \u201cexperiment.\u201d Bard doesn\u2019t yet enhance any Google products you already rely on; it lives on its own website, bard.google.com. It\u2019s not a replacement for Google search. It\u2019s not even a replacement for Assistant, Google\u2019s other AI bot, which also answers questions and operates Android phones and smart speakers.

Pikmin 4 comes out in a couple of days and retails for $59.99, the same price as most other major games on the Switch.

And with Cal's struggles and anger, he kills Bode without mercy. The droid we all know and love, BD-1 makes a strong return in Jedi: Survivor as one of the best video game companions we could ask for. The support and care for Cal and the team shine bright, and you can always count on BD for those helpful beeps and boops as you tackle your goals. BD saves Cal's life in several instances, showing bravery in the face of much bigger threats. As one of the best droid characters the entire series has ever seen, BD deserves as spot so highly held. The protagonist of Fallen Order and Survivor, Cal Kestis has become a beloved character in the overall Star Wars series - not just his Jedi series.

Throughout the story of Jedi: Survivor, we see Cal struggling with the things that have happened in the past. And with betrayal, loss, and growing hatred, he begins to embrace the dark side that he has been feeling. By the end of the game, he shoots Bode down, even after Bode is defenseless. In the final moments of the game, we see Cal reflecting on this darkness, but it is not yet resolved.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":1.0,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Cal Kestis","Noise_20 Document Index":"7","Noise_20 Document":"Search Sign In Sign In Note: Following publication of this article, the release date of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor was moved to April 28, 2023.

After this, the IWGA bought back the commercial rights, and the organising committees of the host cities have been responsible for the organisation and financing since.

The highly-anticipated Pixel Fold will compete for your attention in a quickly crowding foldable phones market of which Samsung is currently king. Here\u2019s everything you need to know about the Google Pixel Fold. Google officially unveiled the Pixel Fold at Google I\/O on March 10, 2023.\u00a0It comes in two colors \u2014 Obsidian and Porcelain. You can also choose between three official Pixel Fold cases that come in Hazel, Porcelain, and Bay colors (pictured above). Google is charging a similar price to the rival Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4. The 256GB variant of the Pixel Fold will cost you a whopping $1,799. The 512GB version is even more expensive at $1,919, which seems costly for Google\u2019s first attempt at a foldable phone. Google hopes you buy the foldable Pixel for its thin form factor, \u201ctrue pocket size,\u201d loaded camera features, \u201call-day battery,\u201d multi-tasking skills, and long-lasting software support. However, we\u2019ll only know if it justifies that price when we review the device. As for availability, Google is not casting a very wide net for the Pixel Fold.

Like Samsung's flagship foldable, the Pixel Fold is a book-style folding phone that has a regular smartphone-like screen on the front and a tablet-like display on the inside. We'll still have to wait a few more weeks until we can get our hands on it, but here is everything Google has announced so far. While Google already announced the Pixel Fold at Google I\/O 2023 (and teased it on Twitter beforehand), the Google Pixel Fold will only ship on June 27. This is right in line with some previous hardware releases at I\/O, like the Pixel 6a, which was only released to stores after more than a month after the event. If you're convinced the Pixel Fold is for you, you can preorder it right now from the Google Store for $1,800. It's an expensive price, but you'll get a free Pixel Watch as part of pre-purchasing. It was long rumored that Google would try and undercut the Galaxy Z Fold 4 in price, but as we can see now, this isn't the case.

The screens on early review samples of its Galaxy Fold failed, forcing the South Korean manufacturer to postpone the product. Samsung and others have since released a few more foldable phones, but none were compelling to me. Google\u2019s entry into the market is significant. Mirroring Apple\u2019s tight control of the iPhone\u2019s design, Google designed both the hardware (including the computing processor) and software that power the Pixel Fold. That means the device\u2019s software was tailored to work with it, and it has long battery life and very fast performance. Beyond the bigger screen, Google has come up with clever reasons for how and why you might use a foldable phone. For one, the Pixel Fold is a great video player to use everywhere because of the way it folds at an angle like a laptop. When I cooked in the kitchen, I played a YouTube video with a recipe and folded the device at a 90-degree angle. The upper half of the screen showed the video, and the lower half showed the description listing the ingredients. In some ways, this was even better than a tablet, which you would have to prop up with a stand on the countertop to view at the proper angle.","Jaccard Noise_20":0.0,"Cosine Noise_20":0.2331238836,"EM Noise_20":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":0,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"Pixel Fold","Noise_40 Document Index":"0","Noise_40 Document":"May 11, 2023 ...

Participation among people ages 55 and older continues to decline; the increasing participation rate represents people under 25 finding or looking for work.

Players who were not automatically eligible had to declare their eligibility for the draft by notifying the NBA offices in writing no later than at least 60 days before the event. For the 2023 draft, the date fell on April 23. Under the CBA a player may withdraw his name from consideration from the draft at any time before the final declaration deadline, which usually falls 10 days before the draft at 5:00 pm EDT (2100 UTC). Under current NCAA rules, players usually have until 10 days after the draft combine to withdraw from the draft and retain college eligibility. They must have withdrawn on or before May 31, 22 days prior to this draft.[70]  A player who has hired an agent retains his remaining college eligibility regardless of whether he is drafted after an evaluation from the NBA Undergraduate Advisory Committee.

The exterior screen goes dark when a user is fully immersed in a virtual world.
