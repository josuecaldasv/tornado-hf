{"Query":"The genre of the drama \"Good Sam\" is what?","Correct Answer":["medical"],"Noise_0 Predicted Answer":"Grey's Anatomy","Noise_0 Document Index":"0","Noise_0 Document":"ER and Grey's Anatomy have such rich legacies that one can't help but compare everything else to one or the other. If it's serious and more precise with the medical details, you're in ER territory. If it's lighter and more on the soapy side of things, you're compared to Grey's Anatomy. Every now and then, one tries to be both (and fails). Good Sam falls very much into the Grey's Anatomy category, complete with a main character forced to live in the shadow of their larger than life parent. In this case, Sam's father is like Dr House: abrasive, cocky, mean and of course the most brilliant person in the room. Because that's not enough, he also has cancer. You know, like New Amsterdam's hero. So, yeah, it's not the most original pilot script. To be fair, Good Sam certainly isn't the most egregious of the Grey's wannabes. It doesn't rely on love stories nearly as much, at least initially. Sam has a boyfriend at the beginning, but then she doesn't anymore. And although there's another character she could fall in love with, that's not the main focus. The focus is her wrought relationship with her father; one that gets more complicated when Griff suddenly awakens from a months-long coma and learns that Sam has become the new Chief of Surgery.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.3327082098,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":0,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"medical","Noise_20 Document Index":"0","Noise_20 Document":"Type keyword(s) to search  Pilot Script Review of Good Sam  Good Sam is CBS's only contender this year in the medical genre after passing on Under The Bridge last pilot season and ordering none the year before. It comes from in-house producer Jennie Snyder Urman, who created and executive produced Jane The Virgin. She currently serves as executive producer on the CW\u2019s Charmed and CBS\u2019s midseason sitcom Broke. The writer is Katie Wech, who previously worked with Urman as co-executive producer on Jane the Virgin. Prior to Good Sam, she wrote ABC's pilot The Hypnotist\u2019s Love Story, based on the Liane Moriarty book, which didn't make it to series for good reasons (read my script review). Most recently, she was one of the many writers hired for Fox\u2019s summer series BH90210. This is also the second year CBS has developed a drama pilot for Sophia Bush. In 2019, she headlined Surveillance, a suspenseful spy thriller (read my preview) which reportedly \"tested through the roof\" but was ultimately determined not to be a good fit for the network.

However, here are a few key points we know about Iris right now based on The Verge\u2019s reporting: They look like ski goggles There isn\u2019t an external power source Exterior cameras place virtual objects in the user\u2019s real-life field of view It runs on Android It uses a custom processor like the Tensor chip in Pixel smartphones An internet connection may be required for some graphical elements Other details, such as whether it\u2019ll use Google\u2019s existing hardware brand names (i.e., Pixel or Nest) or a new name entirely, are still up in the air. It probably won\u2019t share a name with Google Glass, which still exists but is a purely enterprise product now.

The direct successor to Hololens 1 was scrapped because Kipman felt the improvements were too minor and did not see any direct competition. Hololens 2 evolved from a later project, codenamed Sydney. The military version of the Hololens (official name: IVAS), on the other hand, is said to be in development under the codename Delaware and, unlike the Hololens 2, outsources the computing power and battery.

Originally released (in full) in South Korea in 2019, Lost Ark is an MMORPG with Diablo-like ARPG combat. The game quickly grew a sizeable fanbase in that region thanks to its PvP mechanics, extensive content offerings, cinematic style, and all those other MMO tropes that usually encourage people to gleefully spend a few hundred hours of their lives playing them.  So, while Lost Ark has been playable in South Korea and other regions for quite some time, those in the West who recently pre-ordered any of the Lost Ark Founder\u2019s Pack on Steam were also able to start playing the game yesterday (February 8).

Russia's President Vladimir Putin has given varying public explanations for why he launched the invasion. Here are the reasons Putin gave, how they match with reality, and the other likely reasons why Russia sent its armed forces into an independent, sovereign nation. Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union, before declaring itself an independent country, cementing the move in a referendum days before the USSR collapsed in December 1991. The country has maintained its independence ever since. But Putin still refers to Ukraine as Russian, and denies it's a nation in its own right. He told then-US President George W. Bush in 2008 that Ukraine wasn't even a country. Stephen Hall, a Russian politics expert at the University of Bath in the UK, said many Russians still hold this view, and that \"it isn't just the Kremlin.\" Hall said Russia sees Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, as the \"mother of Russian cities,\" and for Putin he can't have that being outside his own country. Hall added that Russia needs to claim Ukraine in order to back up its argument to being a great power that has existed for millennia. Without it \"Russia can't claim a thousand years of history because Kyiv was already in existence 1,200 years ago, when Moscow was a forest,\" he said.","Jaccard Noise_40":0.6666666667,"Cosine Noise_40":0.8160431981,"EM Noise_40":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":1,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"February 2022","Noise_60 Document Index":"9","Noise_60 Document":"\"Nazism is Russia-phobia to them. So the Ukrainians are Nazis because they're anti-Russian.\" Putin also promotes this Nazi idea to win support in the West, where people have always been \"susceptible\" to the argument that Ukraine has a Nazi problem, Hall said. He said Putin's strategy is partly \"throw things at the wall and see what sticks.\" According to Graham, there is no evidence that Putin was under public pressure to invade Ukraine, which suggests at least some of his reasoning was personal. All three experts said Putin's desire to be revered in history books likely motivated him to attack. Hall said Putin's anxiety is around \"am I going to be a footnote in Russian history or are they going to write books about me like they do Peter the Great, Catherine the Great, Stalin.\" Taylor agrees, saying that Putin sees himself as \"a great historic Russian leader restoring Russian lands, and he was thinking about his legacy as he turned 70.\" \"What have the great Czars done? They've expanded Russian territory,\" Graham said. Even with all of the above, why the invasion happened when it did is an intriguing question. Experts pointed to multiple reasons why Russia invaded in February 2022. One was the arrival of Zelenskyy, who came to power in 2019 after a career as a comedian and actor. Putin believed that in Zelenskyy \"he had someone he could manipulate in Ukraine,\" Hall said.","Jaccard Noise_60":0.3333333333,"Cosine Noise_60":0.7539719343,"EM Noise_60":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_60":0,"Noise_80 Predicted Answer":"2014","Noise_80 Document Index":"7","Noise_80 Document":"The factors cited by experts, such as the independent Institute for the Study of War, include Russia\u2019s training and mobilization of hundreds of thousands of troops and the acceleration of the pace of Moscow\u2019s operations in western Luhansk, one of the territories that compose the Donbas region that Russia first invaded in 2014.

In early February 2022, satellite imagery showed the largest deployment of Russian troops to its border with Belarus since the end of the Cold War. Negotiations between the United States, Russia, and European powers\u2014including France and Germany\u2014failed to bring about a resolution. In late February 2022, the United States warned that Russia intended to invade Ukraine, citing Russia\u2019s growing military presence at the Russia-Ukraine border.

The United States responded by imposing sanctions on the regions and the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline a few days later.

It was directed by Hidetaka Miyazaki with worldbuilding provided by fantasy writer George R. R. Martin. It was released for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X\/S on February 25 by FromSoftware in Japan and Bandai Namco Entertainment internationally. Players control a customizable player character who is on a quest to repair the Elden Ring and become the new Elden Lord.  Elden Ring is presented through a third-person perspective; players freely roam its interactive open world. The six main areas are traversed using the player character's steed Torrent as the primary mode of travel. Linear, hidden dungeons can be explored to find useful items. Players can use several types of weapons and magic spells, including non-direct engagement enabled by stealth mechanics. Throughout the game's world, checkpoints enable fast travel and allow players to improve their attributes using an in-game currency called Runes. Elden Ring has an online multiplayer mode in which players can join each other for cooperative and player-versus-player combat.  During planning, FromSoftware wanted to create an open-world game with gameplay similar to Dark Souls; the company wanted Elden Ring to act as an evolution of the self-titled debut of the series. Miyazaki admired the work of Martin, whose contributions he hoped would produce a more accessible narrative than those of the company's earlier games.","Jaccard Noise_40":1.0,"Cosine Noise_40":0.9999999404,"EM Noise_40":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":1,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"February 25, 2022","Noise_60 Document Index":"3","Noise_60 Document":"Feb 13, 2022 ...

According to the results (via DealNTech), the latest Snapdragon 8 chip scored 1483 in single-core and 4709 in multi-core. The A16 Bionic scored 1874 in single-core and 5372 in multi-core. For comparison, the A15 Bionic chip, found in the iPhone 13 Pro and the lower-end iPhone 14 models, also scored higher than Qualcomm's latest chip with 1709 in single-core compared to 1483. In a press release for the new chip, Qualcomm said it will \"define a new standard for connected computing, intelligently engineered with groundbreaking AI across the board to enable extraordinary experiences.\" Qualcomm's senior vice president and general manager of mobile handsets, Chris Patrick, said, \"Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 will revolutionize the landscape of flagship smartphones in 2023.","Jaccard Noise_60":0.5,"Cosine Noise_60":0.7268928289,"EM Noise_60":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_60":1,"Noise_80 Predicted Answer":"A16","Noise_80 Document Index":"6","Noise_80 Document":"By  Mitchell Clark Apple has announced that the regular iPhone won\u2019t be getting a new processor this year \u2014 instead, the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus will be powered by Apple\u2019s A15 Bionic chip, the same chip that\u2019s in the iPhone 13 Pro \u2014 though it does have a bit more grunt than the A15 that was in the regular iPhone 13 and the $429 iPhone SE from earlier this year, thanks to an extra GPU core. This is the first time that Apple\u2019s not updating to a new processor for one of its flagship iPhones since the 2008 iPhone 3G, which featured virtually the same internals as the original iPhone. The iPhone 14 Pro, meanwhile, has an A16 processor, which the company says is more power efficient, even when doing intensive tasks. The raw specs of the new chip are similar, though \u2014 like the A15 in the regular 14, it has a six-core CPU, a five-core GPU, and a 16-core Neural Engine. The new version just has better cores, according to Apple.  The decision not to update the chipset for the standard iPhone 14 isn\u2019t exactly a surprising one. Analysts like Ming-Chi Kuo and reporters like Mark Gurman have been predicting the move for months, and the chip shortage isn\u2019t quite over yet. Using tried and true chips that Apple\u2019s manufacturer already has experience making could help ensure that there are enough processors to meet demand.","Jaccard Noise_80":0.0,"Cosine Noise_80":0.9542800188,"EM Noise_80":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":0,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"Super Retina XDR","Noise_100 Document Index":"2","Noise_100 Document":"Model numbers: A2482 (United States), A2631 (Canada, Japan, Mexico, Saudi Arabia), A2634 (China mainland, Hong Kong, Macao), A2635 (Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia), A2633 (other countires and regions)  Details: iPhone 13\u00a0has a 6.1-inch1\u00a0all-screen Super Retina XDR display.\u00a0The back is glass, and there's a flat-edged anodized aluminum band around the frame.

Lifeguards were able to locate Gaspard and his son, but he told them to focus on getting his son to shore safely.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":1.0,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Abbygail Furrow","Noise_20 Document Index":"8","Noise_20 Document":"1 Life University (NAIA National Semifinal), Men's Wrestling Play of the Year: Andres Labate, Men's Soccer Most Outstanding Team: Beach Volleyball Head Coach of the Year: Diana Villalpando, Beach Volleyball Fans of the Year: Wally & Janie Vohland Game of the Year: Volleyball vs No. 1 Eastern Oregon University (NAIA National Semifinal) Scholar-Athlete of the Year: Avari Ridgway, Volleyball\/Beach Volleyball Ms. Corban: Valerie Olson (Schmidt), Women's Track & Field Ms. Corban: Robert Swoboda, Men's Track & Field\/Cross Country Mighty Warrior Award: Abbygail Furrow, Women's Golf \u00a0 Follow Corban Athletics: Facebook\u00a0l\u00a0Twitter\u00a0 l\u00a0Instagram\u00a0l\u00a0Snapchat\u00a0l\u00a0\u00a0YouTube\u00a0l\u00a0\u00a0Email \r Download our App:\u00a0iOS (iPhone\/iPad)\u00a0l\u00a0Android  Print Friendly Version  08.02.23 06.30.23 06.27.23 06.23.23 05.25.23  Thanks for visiting !

No, really. The roles are perfect.

Alan (Channing Tatum) is the model who portrays Dash \u2014 complete with a flowing blonde wig and frilly shirt \u2014 on all of Loretta's novels, and what he lacks in brains (most of them) he makes up for with sweet sincerity and a desire for Loretta to see him as more than a pretty face.

In this production, Pitt plays soap salesman and street fighter Tyler Durden, and for this role, he made quite an extreme decision: he visited the dentist to have his teeth chipped (via Entertainment Weekly). After filming was over, Pitt went back to the dentist to have his teeth fixed as if nothing had happened. His minor role in The Lost City as Jack Trainer was highly acclaimed and absolutely stole the spotlight. In The Lost City, Bowen Yang has a small role as Ray, the moderator of Loretta Sage's press conference. In recent years, Yang gained notoriety for his appearances on Saturday Night Live, Girls5Eva and the rom-coms Fire Island and Bros. However, a little-known fact about this actor and writer is that his career could have gone in a completely different direction: when he was younger, Bowen enrolled at New York University to study chemistry, intending to become a doctor inspired by his favorite fictional character: Cristina Yang from Grey's Anatomy.

{"Query":"When did Apple M2 chip?","Correct Answer":["June 6","Jun 6","Jun. 6","6 June","6 Jun","6 Jun."],"Noise_0 Predicted Answer":"June 6, 2022","Noise_0 Document Index":"0","Noise_0 Document":"Apple M2 is a series of ARM-based system on a chip (SoC) designed by Apple Inc. as a central processing unit (CPU) and graphics processing unit (GPU) for its Mac desktops and notebooks, and the iPad Pro tablet. It is the second generation of ARM architecture intended for Apple's Mac computers after switching from Intel Core to Apple silicon, succeeding the M1. Apple announced the M2 on June 6, 2022, at WWDC, along with models of the MacBook Air and the 13-inch MacBook Pro using the M2. The M2 is made with TSMC's \"Enhanced 5-nanometer technology\" N5P process and contains 20 billion transistors, a 25% increase from the M1. Apple claims CPU improvements up to 18% and GPU improvements up to 35% compared to the M1.[3]  The M2 was followed by the professional-focused M2 Pro and M2 Max chips in January 2023. The M2 Max is a higher-powered version of the M2 Pro, with more GPU cores and memory bandwidth, and a larger die size.[4] Apple introduced the M2 Ultra in June 2023, combining two M2 Max chips in one package.[1]","Jaccard Noise_0":0.6666666667,"Cosine Noise_0":0.836009264,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"2022","Noise_20 Document Index":"0","Noise_20 Document":"That's an improvement over the original M1, which was configurable with up to an 8-core CPU and 8-core GPU. However it can't match the core counts of the beefier M1 Pro and M1 Max chips, which offer CPU core counts of 8-10 and GPU core counts of 16-32.  That said, Apple claims the M2 chip is capable of up to 18% greater multi-core performance than the M1. Based on our testing, Apple's done it again. Our first opportunity to benchmark the M2 chip came courtesy of Apple, who sent us a 13-inch MacBook Pro 2022 review unit packing a 1TB SSD, 16GB of RAM and an M2 chip with an 8-core CPU and 10-core GPU. The M2 helped the 2022 Pro earn a score of 8,911 in the Geekbench 5.4 multi-core CPU performance test, which is quite good. It's better than the 7,521 earned by the M1-equipped\u00a0MacBook Pro 2020\u00a0two years ago, and it also trounces many of the\u00a0best Windows laptops\u00a0with the latest Intel CPUs, including the\u00a0Lenovo Yoga 9i Gen 7\u00a0we recently tested with a 12th Gen Intel Core i7-1260P\u00a0CPU (7,150).","Jaccard Noise_20":0.0,"Cosine Noise_20":0.4580761492,"EM Noise_20":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":0,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"July 2022","Noise_40 Document Index":"1","Noise_40 Document":"Oct 25, 2022 ...

Twitter invited Musk to join its board of directors, an offer he initially accepted before declining. On April 14, Musk made an unsolicited offer to purchase the company, to which Twitter's board initially responded with a \"poison pill\" strategy to resist a hostile takeover, before unanimously accepting Musk's buyout offer of $44\u00a0billion on April 25. Musk stated that he planned to introduce new features to the platform, make its algorithms open-source, combat spambot accounts, and promote free speech.  In July, Musk announced his intention to terminate the agreement, asserting that Twitter had breached their agreement by refusing to crack down on spambot accounts. The company filed a lawsuit against Musk in the Delaware Court of Chancery shortly thereafter, with a trial scheduled for the week of October 17.

It was Sabalenka\u2019s first Grand Slam title in a rocky career that has included the kind of error-ridden, big-moment meltdowns from which some players almost never recover. Instead, the match proved a microcosm of Sabalenka\u2019s career \u2014 a shaky start, filled with ill-timed double faults followed by a steadying midmatch recovery before a final-set display of raw power and precision that her opponent could not answer.

Alcaraz, the 19-year-old Spanish sensation, beat Casper Ruud of Norway, 6-4, 2-6, 7-6 (1), 6-3, to win his first Grand Slam singles title, but probably not his last. Far, far from it. A blasted serve that came off his racket like a missile sealed it. The Carlos Alcaraz era is here. On Sunday, he reached the sport\u2019s pinnacle in grand fashion on its biggest stage, packing the nearly 24,000 fans in the stadium onto his bandwagon as he claimed not only the men\u2019s singles championship and $2.6 million in prize money, but also the No. 1 ranking in the world, becoming the youngest man to do so. He is the youngest man to win a Grand Slam title since Rafael Nadal won the 2005 French Open as a 19-year-old. The dream becomes reality.","Jaccard Noise_40":1.0,"Cosine Noise_40":0.9999999404,"EM Noise_40":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":1,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"Carlos Alcaraz","Noise_60 Document Index":"9","Noise_60 Document":"Sep 11, 2022 ...

There were flashes of good but the best post-Taylor Quarterback, Michael Brewer was handicapped by injury, and a team in decline as the running game evaporated, and the offensive line recruiting dropped to piecemeal replacements.  Suffice it to say by the late Beamer Era the team was sliding downhill rapidly. Whit Babcock, in a move that didn\u2019t shock anyone after his basketball coaching coup (of the time) with the Buzz hire, went out and found the best available head coach by media and analyst agreement in Justin Fuente. We know how that turned out\u2026 a brilliant 2 season flash followed by a fading ember and a huge bill for the displeasure of having to part company with a failed regime.  Face it, as reported third coaching choice Brent Pry signed his contract to take over as head coach, the Virginia Tech Hokie football program was all show and no go. Regardless of the level of Pry\u2019s enthusiasm he was taking on a leaking hulk with a great paintjob. The indications are that he knew and understood that challenge. The Hokies just haven\u2019t been very good for over a decade and getting over that slump was just not going to be a very easy task, especially for a program that can only generate revenues well below even modest programs.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":1.0,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Brent Pry","Noise_20 Document Index":"5","Noise_20 Document":"The 2022 Virginia Tech Hokies football team represented Virginia Tech during the 2022 NCAA Division I FBS football season.

That deal, we hear, involved not only the absorption of the library but also STX personnel as well. Lionsgate offered a price STX felt was too low to take to its board. In re-arranging its financials of late, STX put two movies into bankruptcy under shell companies to protect the titles: Greenland 2\u00a0and the Chris Pine-Ben Foster movie\u00a0The Contractor. While\u00a0The Contractor\u00a0was sold to Showtime for an estimated $15M+, the pic\u2019s financier 30West filed a complaint in a U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New Orleans asking for dismissal of the Chapter 11 case and claiming STX failed to make $8.4M in contract payments. The bankruptcy filing automatically prohibited 30West from ending its defaulted deal with STX. 30West was seeking to end its contract and reclaim the movie.

The interior ministry announced the final results Monday, with Macron winning 58.5 percent of the vote to Le Pen's 41.5 percent. The campaign was beset by apathy, with many voters dissatisfied with both candidates and the turnout looking likely to be around 2 points lower than it was five years ago.  Politicians across the political spectrum will also likely reflect on the huge number of abstentions, which reached a record 28 percent of the electorate. But ultimately Macron, 44, has won a clear victory that surpassed his polling numbers, surging in the final stages to earn five more years at the helm of one of the continent's two major powers.

{"Query":"What is the megapixel in main camera on the iPhone 14 Pro?","Correct Answer":["48"],"Noise_0 Predicted Answer":"48 megapixels","Noise_0 Document Index":"0","Noise_0 Document":"iPhone 14 Pro models feature an upgraded rear camera system that can shoot 48-megapixel photos, but only in ProRAW mode. This article explains what ProRAW is and how to enable it. Apple's biggest camera upgrade for the \u200ciPhone 14 Pro\u200c and \u200ciPhone 14 Pro\u200c Max models is to the Main lens, which has been increased to 48 megapixels.  Apple says the new sensor also comes with a \"new machine learning model [that] delivers sharper images and less noise for unprecedented detail.\" However, this only applies when taking ProRAW shots at 48 megapixels. Otherwise, the camera defaults to shooting in 12-megapixel resolution, similar to iPhone 13 models.  There's a good reason for this. ProRAW is a 10-bit file that uses the Linear DNG format to retain more information and dynamic range, providing additional flexibility when editing exposure and white balance. With a ProRAW image containing 8,064 x 6,048 pixels, these files consume a significant amount of storage and can be approximately 75MB in size, or three times the size of an average 12-megapixel image.  Unless you have the largest capacity 1TB \u200ciPhone 14 Pro\u200c model, you're unlikely to want to shoot at this resolution all the time.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.5,"Cosine Noise_0":0.5278617144,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"48MP","Noise_20 Document Index":"0","Noise_20 Document":"Get credit toward iPhone\u00a014\u00a0Pro when you trade in an eligible\u00a0smartphone.Get credit toward iPhone\u00a014\u00a0Pro when you trade in an eligible\u00a0smartphone.1 Shop\u00a0iPhone  before trade\u2011in*     View in\u00a0AR   Meet Dynamic\u00a0Island.

The 13 Pro uses a 12-megapixel sensor. Using a technique called pixel binning, the iPhone 14 Pro joins four pixels together into groups to capture 12-megapixel photos with more detail. You can also take a full 48-megapixel image if you shoot in Apple's ProRaw format, and that gives photographers more flexibility when it comes to editing and recovering shadow and highlight detail among many other advantages. In good lighting, the 12-megapixel shots from both the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro look similar at reduced magnification, and it might not be that easy to spot the difference. It's when you push in a bit that the advantages of the 14 Pro's new sensor and image processing become clear. In the images below that I captured in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park, the tree trunks are more defined and sharper on the iPhone 14 Pro's photo than those on the 13 Pro.

The statement read: \u201cAs we have worked with new leadership in\u00a0Blizzard\u00a0and within the franchises themselves, particularly in certain key creative roles, it has become apparent that some of the Blizzard content planned for next year will benefit from more development time to reach its full potential.\u201d \u201cWhile we are still planning to deliver a substantial amount of content from Blizzard next year, we are now planning for a later launch for\u00a0Overwatch 2\u00a0and\u00a0Diablo 4\u00a0than originally envisaged,\u201d it adds. \u201cThese are two of the most eagerly anticipated titles in the industry, and our teams have made great strides towards completion in recent quarters. But we believe giving the teams some extra time to complete production and continue growing their creative resources to support the titles after launch will ensure that these releases delight and engage their communities for many years into the future.","Jaccard Noise_60":0.0,"Cosine Noise_60":0.8537472486,"EM Noise_60":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_60":0,"Noise_80 Predicted Answer":"October 4, 2022","Noise_80 Document Index":"5","Noise_80 Document":"These missions are only available as free-to-play game modes during specific seasons, but Blizzard will offer to buy permanent access to these missions separately or as part of a battle pass bundle.[11]  Overwatch 2 was announced at BlizzCon on November 1, 2019, with plans that the game would maintain a \"shared multiplayer environment\" between it and the original Overwatch, so that players in either game could compete in the existing player versus player (PvP) game modes, retaining all unlocked cosmetics and other features.[12] Jeff Kaplan, director for Overwatch, explained that this was a major decision and that he had to justify this \"player-first standpoint\" to Blizzard executives, given the current industry trend to draw in new sales.[13] All new heroes, maps, and PvP modes were to be added to both games to maintain this shared environment.[14] However, Overwatch 2 was later announced as a free-to-play title, and that on its release on October 4, 2022, Blizzard affirmed that Overwatch 2 live services would replace those of the original game; the original Overwatch servers would be shut down on October 2, 2022.[15] Players retained their existing cosmetics and in-game currency, with remaining loot boxes opened automatically upon the release of Overwatch 2.","Jaccard Noise_80":1.0,"Cosine Noise_80":0.9914528728,"EM Noise_80":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":1,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"Jun 12, 2022","Noise_100 Document Index":"8","Noise_100 Document":"Jun 12, 2022 ...

This time around, the file size is 15 GB. Compared to its predecessors, it's about two gigabytes larger. Switch owners should make sure they have enough free space in their Switch SD card if they plan on installing Xenoblade. Xenoblade Chronicles 3 launches for the Switch on July 29, 2022.

It is an installment in the open-world Xenoblade Chronicles series, itself a part of the larger Xeno franchise. Xenoblade Chronicles 3 depicts the futures of the worlds featured in Xenoblade Chronicles (2010) and Xenoblade Chronicles 2 (2017) and concludes the trilogy's narrative.   The development team wanted to develop a story-driven game in the style of the first two entries in the series, while featuring content and combat from previous Xeno entries. The gameplay combines elements from the first and second entries. Like the first two entries, the game was localized by Nintendo of Europe.    Xenoblade Chronicles 3 takes place in Aionios, where two warring nations, Keves and Agnus, engage in perpetual war fought by soldiers with ten-year lifespans.  The story follows Noah and his two childhood friends, Eunie and Lanz, who are from Keves, and Mio and her two fellow servicemen, Sena and Taion, who are from Agnus. They gain the power of Ouroboros and decide to cooperate to find safety. Through this journey, they uncover the mystery behind the perpetual war and the true nature of their world.","Jaccard Noise_60":0.0,"Cosine Noise_60":0.529530704,"EM Noise_60":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_60":0,"Noise_80 Predicted Answer":"February 2022","Noise_80 Document Index":"1","Noise_80 Document":"Xenoblade Chronicles 3 was announced in February 2022, and was initially set for release in September.

The increase follows several others, including one just months ago, when the cost rose from $10,000 to $12,000. This latest hike is tied to a software update (FSD Beta 10.69.2), which improves overall driving smoothness through turns, enhances pedestrian and animal detection, and enables a creep-into-intersection function. Full Self-Driving is Tesla\u2019s disingenuously named suite of advanced driver-assistance features. Currently, it includes all the functionality of Basic and Enhanced Autopilot, plus the ability to slow the vehicle to a stop as it approaches red traffic signals and signs.

Condal and Miguel Sapochnik served as the showrunners for the first season. Based on parts of Martin's 2018 book Fire & Blood, the series begins about 100 years after the Seven Kingdoms are united by the Targaryen Conquest, nearly 200 years before the events of Game of Thrones, and 172 years before the birth of Daenerys Targaryen. Featuring an ensemble cast, the show portrays the events leading up to the beginning of the decline of House Targaryen, a devastating war of succession known as the \"Dance of the Dragons\".  House of the Dragon received a straight-to-series order in October 2019, with casting beginning in July 2020 and principal photography starting in April 2021 in the United Kingdom. The series premiered on August 21, 2022, with the first season consisting of ten episodes. Five days after its premiere, the series was renewed for a second season.

(12:54) Fourteen months ago, USC quarterback Caleb Williams was a freshman backup at Oklahoma entering the Red River Rivalry game against Texas hoping to give the Sooners a spark. Now, the 20-year-old is a Heisman Trophy winner. On Saturday in New York, Williams -- much like he did on the field this year -- left no doubt that the Heisman was his, securing the award given to the most outstanding player in college football in a decisive victory. Williams outraced Georgia's Stetson Bennett, TCU's Max Duggan and Ohio State's C.J. Stroud for the award. Williams received 544 first-place votes. His 2,031 points easily beat out Duggan, who finished second. Stroud was third, followed by Bennett. \"I may be standing up here today, but y'all get to go to the College Football Playoff,\" Williams said in his acceptance speech, in saluting the other finalists in front of him. \"Guess you can't win them all.\" Over the course of 13 games this season, the former five-star recruit from the Washington, D.C., area dazzled with his play, throwing for 4,075 yards and 37 touchdowns with only four interceptions and rushing for 372 yards and 10 touchdowns.

Williams edged finalists Max Duggan of TCU, C.J. Stroud of Ohio State and Stetson Bennett IV of Georgia -- all quarterbacks -- to become the Trojans' first Heisman winner since running back Reggie Bush, who was later forced to vacate his 2005 award. Williams passed for 4,075 yards, 37 touchdowns and just four interceptions while completing 66.1% of his passes this season. He guided USC to an 11-2 record and appearance in the Pac-12 Championship Game where he played through injuries in a loss to Utah. His victory gives USC eight Heismans, most among any program in the nation. However, given the Heisman Trust and NCAA no longer recognize Bush as having won the trophy in 2005, USC will be listed with seven Heismans, tying it for most all-time with Notre Dame, Ohio State and Oklahoma.","Jaccard Noise_40":1.0,"Cosine Noise_40":0.9999999404,"EM Noise_40":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":1,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"Caleb Williams","Noise_60 Document Index":"7","Noise_60 Document":"Dec 10, 2022 ...

She was 32-28 in two seasons at Texas Tech and had four years remaining on her contract when she was fired. Twelve players left Texas Tech during Stollings' time as coach there -- eight after her first season and four after the second. Stollings told ESPN in 2020 that in taking over a program that went 7-23 overall and 1-17 in the Big 12 in 2017-18, she needed to make massive changes.

{"Query":"Who acquired a stake in FromSoftware?","Correct Answer":["Sony","Tencent"],"Noise_0 Predicted Answer":"Tencent and Sony Interactive Entertainment","Noise_0 Document Index":"7","Noise_0 Document":"'Armored Core' was one of FromSoftware's biggest gaming franchises before the 'Souls' series. In rather tedious news, Tencent and Sony Interactive Entertainment have acquired partial stakes in FromSoftware. More specifically, Tencent has 16.25% of shares and Sony Interactive Entertainment has 14.09% of shares in FromSoftware. The reason why this is boring is that Kadokawa is still the main owner (with 69.66% of the shares) and these new share acquisitions are both non-controlling stakes. In short, nothing has changed and neither Tencent nor Sony have any real decision-making power here. So if you were thinking that Sony would be able to force platform exclusivity for all future FromSoftware titles, then you would be wrong. This will just be business as usual, except that FromSoftware may have some more capital to play around with. One potentially interesting point here is that the money accrued from this will help FromSoftware bolster its publishing plans for the future. This is noteworthy because FromSoftware actually publishes its own games in Japan, so moving that to be more of a global endeavor would be better for all concerned. In that, in the past many of FromSoftware\u2019s games were released internationally by publishers that neither cared nor understood their games. The results were that FromSoftware\u2019s games were given no real international PR or marketing, and the localizations of these games were often thoroughly terrible as well.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.25,"Cosine Noise_0":0.5630176067,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Tencent","Noise_20 Document Index":"7","Noise_20 Document":"Sony and Tencent acquired a 30 percent stake of FromSoftware, the esteemed Japanese video game studio behind \u201cElden Ring\u201d and the Dark Souls series, Wednesday.

In rather tedious news, Tencent and Sony Interactive Entertainment have acquired partial stakes in FromSoftware. More specifically, Tencent has 16.25% of shares and Sony Interactive Entertainment has 14.09% of shares in FromSoftware. The reason why this is boring is that Kadokawa is still the main owner (with 69.66% of the shares) and these new share acquisitions are both non-controlling stakes. In short, nothing has changed and neither Tencent nor Sony have any real decision-making power here. So if you were thinking that Sony would be able to force platform exclusivity for all future FromSoftware titles, then you would be wrong. This will just be business as usual, except that FromSoftware may have some more capital to play around with. One potentially interesting point here is that the money accrued from this will help FromSoftware bolster its publishing plans for the future. This is noteworthy because FromSoftware actually publishes its own games in Japan, so moving that to be more of a global endeavor would be better for all concerned. In that, in the past many of FromSoftware\u2019s games were released internationally by publishers that neither cared nor understood their games. The results were that FromSoftware\u2019s games were given no real international PR or marketing, and the localizations of these games were often thoroughly terrible as well.","Jaccard Noise_60":0.25,"Cosine Noise_60":0.5630176067,"EM Noise_60":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_60":1,"Noise_80 Predicted Answer":"Sixjoy and Sony Interactive Entertainment","Noise_80 Document Index":"7","Noise_80 Document":"Kadokawa announced on Wednesday that Hong Kong-based Tencent subsidiary Sixjoy and Sony Interactive Entertainment have jointly acquired a 30.34% stake in game developer FromSoftware (Elden Ring, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, Dark Souls).

After the firing of Scott Frost, Mickey Joseph will step into Nebraska\u2019s interim head coach role. Joseph played quarterback at Nebraska and got the reigns to the offense in 1991. Joseph led the Cornhuskers to an 8-0 start in the 1991 season but fell to Colorado a week later.

Meta faces a hefty GDPR fine for its handling of children's data. Meta is facing a fine of 405 million euros, or just over $400 million, from Ireland's Data Protection Commission for failing to safeguard children's information on Instagram.\u00a0 The country's data watchdog had accused Instagram of setting children's accounts to \"public\" by default and allowing children to operate business accounts on the platform, which could leave their phone numbers and email addresses exposed. Full details of the decision are expected to be published next week, a commission spokesman said Tuesday.\u00a0 Meta confirmed the fine and said it plans to appeal the decision.\u00a0 \"This inquiry focused on old settings that we updated over a year ago, and we've since released many new features to help keep teens safe and their information private,\" a Meta spokesperson told CNET via email on Tuesday. \"Anyone under 18 automatically has their account set to private when they join Instagram, so only people they know can see what they post, and adults can't message teens who don't follow them.\"\u00a0 The spokesperson added that Meta disagrees with how the fine was calculated and is reviewing the rest of the commission's decision.

The response in the other Commonwealth realms was similarly mixed; while there were many celebrations, some government officials and indigenous groups took the opportunity to voice republican sentiments and call for reparatory justice.  Charles' and Camilla's coronation was the first of a British monarch in the 21st century and the 40th to be held at Westminster Abbey since the coronation of William the Conqueror in 1066.[1][b]  Charles\u00a0III became king immediately upon the death of his mother, Elizabeth\u00a0II, at 15:10 BST on Thursday 8 September 2022.

Charles acceded to the throne on 8\u00a0September 2022 upon the death of his mother, Elizabeth\u00a0II.  The ceremony was structured around an Anglican service of Holy Communion. It included Charles taking an oath, being anointed with holy oil, and receiving the coronation regalia, emphasising his spiritual role and secular responsibilities.[a] Representatives of the Church of England and the British royal family declared their allegiance to him, and people throughout the Commonwealth realms were invited to do so. Camilla was crowned in a shorter and simpler ceremony. After the service, members of the royal family travelled to Buckingham Palace in a state procession and appeared on the palace's rear and front balconies. The service was altered from past British coronations to represent multiple faiths, cultures, and communities across the United Kingdom; it was shorter than Elizabeth II's coronation in 1953, and had a peak UK television audience of 20.4 million.  The coronation elicited both celebrations and protest in the United Kingdom, with surveys carried out before the event suggesting that the British public was ambivalent towards the ceremony and its funding.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.75,"Cosine Noise_100":0.9041187167,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":1}

Superman's nemesis Lex Luthor is a major figure in the show's fourth season, and he's played by a veteran actor.

Calculating Annual Inflation Rates Annual rates of inflation are calculated using 12-month selections of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) which is published monthly by the Labor Department\u2019s Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). To calculate the inflation rate for a specific month, such as January 2017, subtract the CPI for that month of the previous year (in this case, January 2016) from the current CPI (January 2017). The result is the difference between the two CPIs. Divide this number by the CPI for the previous year, then multiply by 100 and add a percentage sign to obtain the inflation rate for the given month. For example, to calculate the inflation rate for January 2017, subtract the January 2016 CPI of 236.916 from the January 2017 CPI of 242.839, which yields 5.923. Divide 5.923 by 236.916, multiply by 100, and add a % sign to obtain an inflation rate of 2.5% for January 2017.

Breath of the Wild is considered one of the greatest video games of all time. Journalists described it as a landmark in open-world design for its emphasis on experimentation, physics-based sandbox, and emergent gameplay. Numerous developers cited Breath of the Wild as inspiration, and it is a popular point of comparison among open-world games.

Breath of the Wild is an open world action-adventure game. Players are tasked with exploring the kingdom of Hyrule while controlling Link. Breath of the Wild encourages nonlinear gameplay, which is illustrated by the game's lack of defined entrances or exits to areas,[1] scant instruction given to the player, and encouragement to explore freely.[2] Breath of the Wild introduces a consistent physics engine to the Zelda series, letting players approach problems in different ways rather than trying to find a single solution.[3] The game also integrates a \"chemistry engine\" that defines the physical properties of most objects and governs how they interact with the player and one another.","Jaccard Noise_40":1.0,"Cosine Noise_40":1.0,"EM Noise_40":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":1,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"BotW","Noise_60 Document Index":"0","Noise_60 Document":"Nintendo has guarded the new Breath of the Wild game so tightly that players do not even know the title of the new Legend of Zelda.

In addition to placing third, this Texas-based rocker left with the judges\u2019 respect; they acknowledged that he already scored a No. 1 song and easily could have walked away from the competition. It was close but no cigar for this Australian pole dancer, who placed second. And the highest of congratulations are in order for this dance group from Lebanon.

Giorgia Meloni, leader of Fratelli d'Italia (Brothers of Italy), will become the first female prime minister in Italy\u2019s history. Her election last month will move the country to the far right for the first time since Benito Mussolini\u2019s fall during World War II. The Brothers of Italy, which was founded by Meloni, is a national-conservative populist party that opposes undocumented immigration, according to its website. Meloni\u2019s victory now means uncertainty for those who migrated to Italy. When Baryali Waiz, a refugee in Italy, heard the results of the general election, he said he was worried. \u201cWhat happens when voters can\u2019t find work? They blame migrants,\u201d Waiz told ABC News. As of August, Italy\u2019s unemployment rate stood at 8.1%, the third highest in the European Union after Spain and Greece. Clamping down on immigration was a key part of Meloni\u2019s campaign. Though she softened her rhetoric before the election, Meloni pledged stricter border controls and proposed establishing European Union-managed centers to analyze asylum applications. There are about 5 million foreign-born residents in Italy, making up less than 9% of the country\u2019s total population of 59.2 million, according to the country\u2019s most recent census data.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.9999998808,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Giorgia Meloni","Noise_20 Document Index":"6","Noise_20 Document":"Giorgia Meloni (Italian:\u00a0[\u02c8d\u0292ord\u0292a me\u02c8lo\u02d0ni]; born 15 January 1977) is an Italian politician who has been serving as the prime minister of Italy since 22 October 2022, the first woman to hold this position.

In 1992, Meloni joined the Youth Front, the youth wing of the Italian Social Movement (MSI), a neo-fascist political party founded in 1946 by former followers of Italian fascism. She later became the national leader of Student Action, the student movement of the National Alliance (AN), a post-fascist party that became the MSI's legal successor in 1995 and moved towards national conservatism. She was a councillor of the Province of Rome from 1998 to 2002, after which she became the president of Youth Action, the youth wing of AN. In 2008, she was appointed Italian Minister of Youth in the fourth Berlusconi government, a role which she held until 2011.

In 2021, actors accepted Golden Globes remotely at a time when organizers were just beginning to grapple with a growing scandal around finances, ethics and diversity in its ranks. Last year, NBC refused to air the show at all, saying that the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the troubled organization at the center of the scandal, needed time to make \u201cmeaningful reform.\u201d But on Tuesday, the 80th annual Golden Globe Awards are back on NBC with a show that will attempt to win the trust of viewers and participants. What is not yet clear is how many of those viewers will return, after a precipitous drop in ratings during the pandemic, and whether celebrities and other members of the industry will appear en masse. The Globes have long had a reputation for booziness and irreverence. Will the revived ceremony still be seen as a less-staid alternative to the Academy Awards? Or will the Hollywood Foreign Press take the show more seriously?

As such, it\u2019s already a popular device with plenty of market value despite its shortcomings. Additionally, activity in the Fitbit stable suggests Google may be moving more of its chips into the Pixel Watch pot.

With that in mind, we should expect the Google Pixel Watch 2 to have the same kind of design, with a domed display, rotating digital crown, and unobtrusive band mechanisms. However, if Google could improve anything with the design here, it should start with thinner bezels on the round display. Durability should be around the same as the first Pixel Watch, and it\u2019s expected to run a version of Wear OS, possibly Wear OS 4.

Verstappen has been dominant all season and claimed the title with four races remaining. The Dutchman started from pole in pouring rain only for the race to be stopped after two laps as several cars crashed. It was resumed two hours later with 28 of the 53 laps completed and Verstappen leading the whole way. He was followed by teammate Sergio Perez in second and Ferrari driver Charles Leclerc. They were the only drivers who could have overtaken Verstappen for the title. Verstappen now has an unsurmountable lead with 366 points. Perez has 253 and Leclerc 252. Verstappen did not know initially that he had won the season title after the shortened race, thinking that the full 25 points for a win would not be awarded. But a short time later, the FIA \u2014 F1\u2032s governing body \u2014 awarded full points.

A recovery vehicle was immediately dispatched, with several drivers passing the tractor at speed under double-yellow flags on the second lap.[13] Alex Albon also retired due a collision with Kevin Magnussen which caused damage to his radiator.[14]  The race resumed at 16:15 local time behind the safety car. Only twenty-eight laps were completed before the race was curtailed due to it passing the three-hour time limit, with Verstappen taking his twelfth victory of the season. Leclerc, who finished second on track, was given a five-second penalty for cutting the final chicane whist defending from P\u00e9rez in third, which demoted him to third behind P\u00e9rez.

Going forward, Nvidia will have to balance its drive to sell more cards with sensitivity to customers who have been eagerly awaiting the chance to buy a new GPU at a reasonable price. While the $1,599 price tag on the new 4090 is anything but, the other cards in Nvidia's new 40-series should be significantly cheaper. Hopefully, the company can do something to discourage scalpers and ensure more fans have a shot at buying one of these new cards at a fair price.

Today, two tests have been spotted, and they bode pretty well for the GPU. The RTX 3060, which is still a favorite among Nvidia users, might be around 20% slower than the upcoming Ada Lovelace model. Will the RTX 4060 become one of the best GPUs, or at least one of the most popular models in this generation? One might think that a GPU that costs over $40,000 is going to be the best graphics card for gaming, but the truth is a lot more complex than that. In fact, this Nvidia GPU can't even keep up with integrated graphics solutions. Now, before you get too upset, you should know I'm referring to Nvidia's H100, which houses the GH100 chip (Grace Hopper). It's a powerful data center GPU made to handle high-performance computing (HPC) tasks -- not power PC games. It doesn't have any display outputs, and despite its extensive capabilities, it also doesn't have any coolers. This is because, again, you'd find this GPU in a data center or server setting, where it'd be cooled with powerful external fans. Nvidia has just quietly announced the official release date of the RTX 4060. The GPU is coming out on June 29 and will be priced at $299.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.6506029963,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

The hunger for more sports biopics is great, and the eyes of the world constantly await the next offering. Well, one such offering is just around the corner, in the form of Martin Guigui's Sweetwater (2023). Telling the tale of Nat Clifton, an NBA Hall of Famer, the film itself has been in the works since 2007 and is finally being released this year. Of course, we know that the movie will be about the life of Nat Clifton, but a film cannot simply show every aspect of a person's life, and will often choose a specific period of importance.

Google\u2019s very first smartwatch is finally here, and I\u2019ve spent the past week learning whether it\u2019s any good.           The Pixel Watch is basically a combination of two things: a smartwatch built to work in tandem with Google\u2019s Pixel smartphones, and a Fitbit. The company is leaning heavily on making the Fitbit brand synonymous with this good-looking piece of hardware. After all, it has a great reputation in the fitness tracker market, and many users swear by it for all of their health data needs. So after Google\u2019s acquisition of the company in 2019 for a cool $2.1 billion, it\u2019s no wonder that the company is making it a cornerstone of the Pixel Watch\u2019s appeal.           Google obviously needs a couple of those for the Pixel watch to succeed. It\u2019s a premium watch by every metric, with a starting price of $349. I have the LTE model, which costs $399, and I was also given a couple of bands to check out.           Does the Pixel Watch do enough to earn a place on your wrist? Let\u2019s find out.

Back in October of last year, Google announced that the YouTube Premium family plan price was going up to $22.99 per month. This new increase would affect those on legacy plans who were paying $14.99 and also those with $17.99 plans. This is an increase that touches them all, unfortunately.

Below, we\u2019ve captured some of that email:  For those of us on the old legacy $14.99 price, this is quite the jump.

The gameplay is similar to the previous 2018 installment. It features combo-based combat, as well as puzzle and role-playing elements. The gameplay has been revamped from the previous game: in addition to Kratos' main weapons, a magical battle axe and his double-chained blades, he also acquires a magical spear and his shield has become more versatile, with different types of shields that have differing offensive and defensive abilities. His son Atreus, as well as some other characters, provide assistance in combat and can be passively controlled.","Jaccard Noise_20":0.6666666667,"Cosine Noise_20":0.7897343636,"EM Noise_20":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":1,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"Sep 13, 2022","Noise_40 Document Index":"1","Noise_40 Document":"Sep 13, 2022 ... https:\/\/www.playstation.com\/en-us\/games\/god-of-war-ragnarok\/ Set out on an ...

Sunak will be the first person of color to lead the United Kingdom. (Oct. 25) LONDON (AP) \u2014 Rishi Sunak became Britain\u2019s third prime minister this year on Tuesday, tasked with taming an economic crisis that has left the country\u2019s finances in a precarious state and millions struggling to pay their food and energy bills. Sunak, who is the U.K.\u2019s first leader of color, met King Charles III at Buckingham Palace, where the monarch officially asked the new leader of the governing Conservative Party to form a government, as is tradition. Sunak clinched the leadership position Monday, seen by his party as a safe pair of hands to stabilize an economy sliding toward recession \u2014 and stem its own plunging popularity, after the brief, disastrous term of Liz Truss.  Her package of unfunded tax cuts spooked financial markets with the prospect of ballooning debt, drove the pound to record lows and forced the Bank of England to intervene \u2014 weakening Britain\u2019s fragile economy and obliterating Truss\u2019 authority within her party. In one of his first acts, Sunak announced he would retain Treasury chief Jeremy Hunt, appointed by Truss to steady the markets two weeks ago amid the turmoil. His removal would have set off new tremors.","Jaccard Noise_80":1.0,"Cosine Noise_80":0.9999999404,"EM Noise_80":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":1,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"Sunak","Noise_100 Document Index":"7","Noise_100 Document":"While there were rumours about a Johnson comeback over the weekend, he pulled out of the contest on Sunday.

The Tories retain a majority in parliament, meaning that as their leader, Sunak will be named prime minister by King Charles III.

Finance minister Jeremy Hunt \u2013 the fourth person in that role in four months \u2013 is due to present a budget on October 31 to plug a black hole in the public finances, which is expected to have ballooned to up to 40 billion pounds ($45.2bn). Conservative political commentator Alex Deane noted that the last three Conservative prime ministers have been brought down by members of their own party. \u201cSo it\u2019s very nice to hear people say good things about our new leader,\u201d Deane told Al Jazeera. \u201c[Sunak] didn\u2019t have a direct electoral mandate,\u201d Deane said. \u201c\u2026 One of the things he is going to have to do \u2026 is preside over a period of relative calm, reassuring the markets and not doing anything too bold or too rapid.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.5,"Cosine Noise_100":0.6487212181,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

While the monthly cost is lower for consumers, the newest tier comes with hidden price tags. In the new Netflix Basic with Ads tier, users can expect around 4-5 minutes of ads per hour. How is this comparable to other Connected TV subscriptions? While the amount of ad time per hour for Netflix is comparable to other streaming services, the lingering issue is\u00a0when an ad will show. Ad timings are unpredictable, which interrupts the user experience. The video content for ads is about what you expect compared to other streaming services. But the same issue is at hand \u2013 when will this show up in a user\u2019s watching experience on Netflix? According to Jay Peters from\u00a0 The Verge, a user\u2019s ad experience varies dramatically between types of content consumed: As you can see from this example, the amount of ads, as well as the placement of ads, is inconsistent, which leads to believe that Netflix is testing to find the best engagement for not only users but advertisers.

{"Query":"Where does The White Lotus Season 2 take place","Correct Answer":["Sicily"],"Noise_0 Predicted Answer":"Italy","Noise_0 Document Index":"4","Noise_0 Document":"This is a core theme in the first season of The White Lotus; White found that \u201cHawaii is a very paradisiacal and idyllic place,\u201d but its economy is dominated by tourists and military contractors who are largely unaware of the issues of American imperialism. Ironically, Season 1 was filmed amidst the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic when the tourism industry had been facing many setbacks. This gave production designer Laura Fox the opportunity to spend time redesigning the artwork, sets, and scenery in each room featured in the series; The White Lotus fans have enjoyed analyzing the background details for hidden Easter eggs, and Fox herself compared the subtle menace of the hotel to The Shining. Between assassination attempts, mafia, familial conflict, and beautiful Italian scenery, The White Lotus: Sicily had a lot in common with The Godfather. Similar to Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s 1972 crime classic, season 2 was filmed on location in Italy. The San Domenico Palace, Taormina stands in for the clifftop resort in the series. Additionally, White makes use of several local wonders, including the Ionian Sea, the Greek Theater of Teatro Antico di Taormina, and the active Mount Etna volcano, which erupts in the final episode, \u201cArrivederci.\u201d Considering that The White Lotus: Sicily focuses on the issues of colonialism, it makes sense that the series was filmed in a location with a complex history.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.7206804752,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":0,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Hawaii and Sicily","Noise_20 Document Index":"0","Noise_20 Document":"The White Lotus is an American black comedy-drama anthology television series created by Mike White for HBO.[5][6] It follows the guests and employees of the fictional White Lotus resort chain, whose interactions are affected by their various psychosocial dysfunctions.

Intended as a six-part limited series, The White Lotus premiered on July 11, 2021, to critical acclaim and high ratings. The show's success led to HBO renewing it as an anthology series; a second season premiered on October 30, 2022.[8] In November 2022, the series was renewed for a third season.[9] While no official announcement has been made, Variety reports that the third season will be filmed in Thailand,[10] and that Natasha Rothwell will reprise her role as Belinda from the first season.[11]  The series received a positive critical response. It was included on the American Film Institute's list of the ten best programs of 2021 and 2022, and received various accolades including ten Primetime Emmy Awards, and two Golden Globes.

Between Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery, White Noise, and Triangle of Sadness, we got a ton of great content that forced the upper class to have traumatic vacations. The pinnacle of this was the second season of The White Lotus, which moved the miniseries to a luxurious new location in Italy. Unfortunately for the characters, this had more in common with the Italian scenery of The Talented Mr. Ripley than it did with Under The Tuscan Sun. As with the first season, the end of this trip is teased at the very beginning, and it\u2019s a violent one. Both seasons of The White Lotus take place at individual locations in a luxury vacation resort chain. A multitude of guests (most of whom are incredibly wealthy) interact with the staff and local residents, only to begin squabbling and bringing up past issues. While the show\u2019s brilliance stems from the inventive storytelling of writer\/director Mike White, it doesn\u2019t hurt that the show has the budget and scale of an HBO production. In order to make the series as authentic as possible, White and his production team utilized several real locations in both seasons. The White Lotus has drawn critical acclaim due to how close its satire feels to reality, and the believability extends to the filming locations themselves.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.7206804752,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

{"Query":"which party controls the house after 2022 midterm elections?","Correct Answer":["Republican "],"Noise_0 Predicted Answer":"Democrats","Noise_0 Document Index":"5","Noise_0 Document":"A Republican House will likely clash on most issues with a Democratic Senate in 2023, with bitter fights over basic functions like funding the government threatening to paralyze Washington.    GOP candidates hoped to capitalize on voter frustration with the rising costs of groceries and gas, framing the election as a referendum on President Joe Biden and his party's rule of both the White House and Congress. But voters in exit polls indicated other issues like abortion rights and protecting democracy factored into their decisions at the ballot box. Redistricting in New York and Florida also helped the GOP overcome lackluster results in most of the races rated as toss-ups. The last time the president and top congressional leaders were from different parties was 2019, when Democrats regained control of the House in the 2018 midterms, two years after former President Donald Trump was elected president.  A new House Republican majority will mean Biden's legislative agenda is essentially dead, unless he can find bipartisan support for some narrowly crafted proposals. Biden's focus during the next two years of his presidency will likely be spent defending his signature accomplishments, like a bill lowering prescription drug prices and investing hundreds of billions of dollars to tackle climate change. GOP lawmakers have already said they want to roll back some of Biden's programs, or defund many of them.  The Biden White House will also face an onslaught of investigations on a wide range of issues.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.6566407681,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":0,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Democratic Party","Noise_20 Document Index":"0","Noise_20 Document":"Nov 12, 2022 ... \u201cElection Week\u201d is coming to a close with control of the House still up ... to the Democratic Party's tally, and four races to Republicans'.","Jaccard Noise_20":0.0,"Cosine Noise_20":0.6260359287,"EM Noise_20":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":0,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"Democrats","Noise_40 Document Index":"1","Noise_40 Document":"This projection was based on a variety of metrics, including generic ballot testing that favored a Republican-led Congress as well as President Biden\u2019s low approval rating, which hovers around 40%. Super PACS and political party groups were spending money almost exclusively in districts that President Biden won in 2020, indicating that Democrats were in a defensive crouch. Midterm elections often benefit the opposition political party at the expense of the White House\u2019s party. 1994 and 2010 were typical midterm elections, where Republicans made gains in the House at the midpoint of Bill Clinton and Barack Obama\u2019s first terms. Similarly, in 2018, Republican\u2019s got crushed in House elections but picked up two seats in the Senate. If a president\u2019s approval ratings are high, then the presiding party typically fares better in midterm House elections. For example, in 1998, Bill Clinton\u2019s approval rating was 66%, and Democrats retained control of the House. In 2002, George W. Bush polled at a 63%, and Republicans made gains. Currently, Biden\u2019s approval rating is 42%, which is similar to former president Barack Obama\u2019s rating in 2010.

The November midterm elections will determine which parties take control over the House and the Senate, ultimately defining the fate of President Joe Biden\u2019s legislative agenda. (Oct. 14) WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Democrats have held both chambers of Congress and the presidency for the last two years, but they may not have such consolidated power for much longer.  Republicans are favored to win the House in the Nov. 8 midterm elections, bolstered by frustration over the economy and advantages in the redistricting process that takes place every 10 years. But Democrats are working to hold their ground, campaigning on maintaining access to abortion and other issues.  The outlook is murkier in the Senate, where Republicans are bidding to take back control. Several races in key battleground states are tight, leading Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell to say the chances of his party winning a majority are just 50-50.  A look at control of Congress and what will happen if Republicans win a majority in either chamber in the election:  Democrats, led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have held the majority since 2018, when they won control in then-President Donald Trump\u2019s first midterm election. Republicans could take back the House if they net just five seats in dozens of competitive districts, and they are trying to win dozens.

{"Query":"Who is the Doctor's new companion in Doctor Who?","Correct Answer":["Millie Gibson"],"Noise_0 Predicted Answer":"Millie Gibson","Noise_0 Document Index":"0","Noise_0 Document":"Gibson will join Ncuti Gatwa aboard the TARDIS. Millie Gibson will be the new Doctor Who companion, joining Ncuti Gatwa for adventures in time and space. The casting was revealed during this year's Children in Need broadcast on BBC One. Gibson, best known for playing Kelly Neelan on ITV soap Coronation Street for three years, will play a character named Ruby Sunday. Alongside Gatwa, Millie Gibson will make her Doctor Who debut over the festive season in 2023 when the Fifteenth Doctor takes control of the TARDIS. \"Whilst still being in total disbelief, I am beyond honoured to be cast as the Doctor\u2019s companion,\" said Gibson. \"It is a gift of a role, and a dream come true, and I will do everything to try and fill the boots the fellow companions have travelled in before me. And what better way to do that than being by the fabulous Ncuti Gatwa\u2019s side, I just can\u2019t wait to get started.\" Gatwa added: \"Millie just is the companion. She is full of talent, strength, she has a cheeky sparkle in her eye and is sharp as a razor. From the moment she walked into the room she captured all of our attention with her effervescence and then solidified that attention with the sheer torque of her talent.

Not only is fan favorite David Tennant returning to the franchise for a series of specials, but Ncuti Gatwa has been cast as the Fifteenth Doctor, the first black actor to play the iconic hero. While little is known about the new Doctor, the BBC did announce that Millie Gibson has been cast as Ruby Sunday, the Doctor's new companion. Much attention has been paid to Tennant's return and Gatwa's casting, but Gibson is an exciting choice for the franchise. The companion is just as important for Doctor Who as the Doctor himself, so the person cast in the role takes on a big responsibility. At just 18 years old, she will be the youngest person to be cast as a companion and was only a one-year-old when the series was revived in 2005. Is the young star ready for such a major role? Her casting might be the key to understanding the new direction for the series. The Doctor's companion is an important role in the series, but this is a performance on a television series. This is not the same as an actual medical doctor or a firefighter where one does expect years of training and a certain level of experience to be considered qualified.","Jaccard Noise_20":1.0,"Cosine Noise_20":1.0,"EM Noise_20":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":1,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"Millie Gibson","Noise_40 Document Index":"8","Noise_40 Document":"Nov 18, 2022 ...

Another companion, Captain Jack Harkness, is the lead character in the spin-off BBC science fiction programme Torchwood. Not only have these former companions continued to make appearances on Doctor Who, they have sometimes been accompanied by some of their own companions from the spin-offs when doing so, including Jack's colleagues Gwen Cooper and Ianto Jones, and Sarah Jane's 'family' Mr Smith, Luke Smith and K-9 Mark IV.

Saudi Arabia 2, Argentina 1 Argentina is still alive in the tournament after Tuesday's shocking result. Unfortunately, that's where the good news ends for La Albiceleste. History tells us that making out of the group stage is incredibly difficult when you lose your first game, let alone winning the World Cup \u2014 only Spain (2010) has accomplished the latter. Argentina's next opponents, Mexico and Poland, are beatable, but as we saw Tuesday, so is Argentina. It's not all good news for Saudi Arabia either. Ironically, it might have even more pressure to get results against Mexico and Poland than before now that qualifying for the knockout stages is a real possibility. But for now, Saudi Arabia is reeling in the fact that it beat one of the tournament favorites, and arguably the greatest player of all time.

{"Query":"What is the title of the new season of \"Criminal Minds\"?","Correct Answer":["Evolution"],"Noise_0 Predicted Answer":"Criminal Minds: Evolution","Noise_0 Document Index":"1","Noise_0 Document":"The Criminal Minds reboot on Paramount+ gets a brand new title which effectively resolves one of the biggest problems of the upcoming series.  The Criminal Minds reboot's new title - Criminal Minds: Evolution - resolves one of its biggest problems. Paramount+ is bringing back FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit (BAU) to the small screen not long after the team wrapped up its run on CBS for 15 years. While the profilers will miss a couple of their co-workers such as Matthew Gray Gubler's Spencer Reid and Daniel Henney's Matt Simmons, the rest of the squad will be intact as they track down a network of UnSubs which was established during the coronavirus pandemic. Many aspects of the original Criminal Minds run will stay the same, but Evolutions has some fresh aspects, including a new title. Retitling Paramount+'s Criminal Minds revival as Criminal Minds: Evolution is appropriate given this new version of the show. The project is a continuation of its CBS run, so technically, it isn't really a \"reboot\" as it has usually been referred to. The cast remains the same and its events take place in the same continuity. Instead of calling it Criminal Minds season 16, however, giving it a different title allows it to separate itself from the CBS procedural without totally severing its ties with it. It also hints that everything in Criminal Minds: Evolution is an evolved version of the original show, which seems to be the case.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.3333333333,"Cosine Noise_0":0.3522495031,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Evolution","Noise_20 Document Index":"4","Noise_20 Document":"The sixteenth season of the American police procedural crime drama television series Criminal Minds, subtitled Evolution,  follows members of the Behavioral Analysis Unit (BAU) as they are faced with a network of serial killers built during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Robinson, Fielding H. Yost, Dana X. Bible, Biff Jones, Bob Devaney, and Tom Osborne. Osborne is the program's all-time leader in most major categories; his .836 career winning percentage is fourth-highest in major college football history.[2] Thirteen Nebraska coaches have won a conference championship at the school, and Devaney and Osborne combined to win five national titles.  The program's first extended period of success came under the leadership of W.C. Cole and Ewald O. Stiehm. Between 1900 and 1916, Nebraska had five undefeated seasons and completed a stretch of thirty-four consecutive games without a loss, still a program record.[3] Despite a span of twenty-one conference championships in thirty-three seasons, the Cornhuskers did not experience major national success until Devaney was hired in 1962.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":1.0,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Matt Rhule","Noise_20 Document Index":"2","Noise_20 Document":"Nov 28, 2022 ...

He's credited for improving the football programs at both Baylor and Temple while serving as a head coach. While coaching at Temple from 2013 to 2016, Rhule and the Owls won 28 games.

The Warner Bros. project was first announced in 2019, but is now being released four years later. Variety has confirmed that Gerwig and Baumbach were planning to finish the film after Baumbach finished on his 2022 film White Noise.  While they might share similar physical attributes - long blonde hair, blue eyes, a wide smile - Robbie and Barbie also share somewhat similar career trajectories.  After all, Barbie has been known to have more than 150 careers on her CV, from registered nurse to rock star, veterinarian to aerobics instructor, pilot to police officer.  According to the Barbie website, the doll first broke the 'plastic ceiling' in the 1960s when, 'as an astronaut, she went to the moon\u2026four years before Neil Armstrong'.","Jaccard Noise_80":0.0,"Cosine Noise_80":0.3927200139,"EM Noise_80":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":0,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"Kate McKinnon","Noise_100 Document Index":"0","Noise_100 Document":"WELCOME TO BARBIE LAND, did you bring your rollerblades? \ud83c\udf1f #BarbieTheMovie only in theaters July 21. pic.twitter.com\/gBKLlF0aCI In the film\u2019s third full-length trailer, released today, we discover more about the core plot.

Wales striker Gareth Bale had already canceled out Timothy Weah\u2019s first-half strike with a late penalty and was bearing down ominously in search of a last-gasp winner. Despite running tirelessly all match, legs no doubt feeling like lead and lungs pumping acid, Adams emerged from nowhere to steal the ball from the five-time Champions League winner with a precise tackle. It capped an all-action display from the 23-year-old Adams which included winning 83.3% of his attempted tackles, six recoveries and two interceptions, according to stats website FotMob. The Leeds United midfielder pulled the strings in the center of the pitch all match, disrupting Wales with astute positional awareness and feeding his more attack-minded teammates like Weah and Christian Pulisic.

At this stage it was decided to name the prize after Mark Twain.[3]  The inaugural recipient of the award was Richard Pryor.[7] The first two years of the prize honoring Pryor and Jonathan Winters were taped and broadcast on Comedy Central.[7] Since then, the award presentations have been taped for broadcast on PBS.[8] In 2013 Carol Burnett was awarded, at age 80, while the youngest recipient has been actress and comedian Tina Fey, at age 40 in 2010.[9][10][11] The Kennedy Center's intent is to give the award to living persons, but one recipient, George Carlin, died in 2008 before receiving his award.

Charlie Baker, the newly named president of the NCAA, will take the reins from Mark Emmert in March at a time when the organization and its controversial system of amateurism face existential crises.  \tBaker, a Harvard graduate who played basketball for the Crimson, was elected in 2014 and reelected in 2018. He previously served as CEO of Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates.  \tA popular Republican in a heavily Democratic state, Baker is regarded as a fiscally conservative, socially progressive consensus-builder who is pragmatic and open to reforms and different ideas. That skill set will be helpful as Baker faces daunting challenges at the NCAA.\u00a0    \tOne major issue will be developing an enforceable and lawful policy on name, image and likeness. Under Emmert\u2019s leadership, the NCAA hastily adopted an interim NIL policy in June 2021, days before a set of state NIL statutes were set to go into effect that made it illegal for the NCAA and member schools to punish college athletes for using their right of publicity to sign endorsement deals and enter into sponsorships. The NCAA had hoped Congress would pass a federal NIL bill that would have contained an antitrust exemption, but no bill even made it out of committee.  \t           \tTo date, members of Congress have viewed NIL in disparate ways.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.9999998808,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Charlie Baker","Noise_20 Document Index":"2","Noise_20 Document":"Dec 15, 2022 ...

It wanted a former college athlete, an exec passionate about higher education, an established corporate leader and a savvy politician who knows how to get things done in government.

The NCAA announced today that it has selected the two-term governor to be its next president. Baker will replace outgoing NCAA President Mark Emmert starting March 1. His second term as governor is slated to conclude Jan. 5; he announced about a year ago that he wouldn\u2019t seek a third term. Emmert will stay on as an adviser through June. The NCAA\u2019s choice of Baker, 66, signifies the association\u2019s desire to have a leader who is well-versed in the ways that Washington, D.C., works. With the NCAA facing so many legal and legislative challenges, the board of governors, who made the hire, focused on someone from the political arena early in the process and Baker emerged as the candidate with the experience and expertise to navigate the governmental and athletic worlds that often collide in college sports.

Alegre\u2019s departure from Activision to Yuga Labs may be seen as a positive move for those who are critical of Activision\u2019s leadership and culture.

After a long stint at DC, Snyder is now one of Netflix\u2019s most prominent directors, creating the recent zombie apocalypse film Army of the Dead. His next project is the epic sci-fi fantasy Rebel Moon, which will likely be split into two massive features with the potential for spinoff properties. Army of the Dead came out in 2021 and became one of the most-watched movies on the platform and won the Oscars Fan Favorite contest. The heist film already spawned one prequel film, Army of Thieves, and the anime-style spinoff series Lost Vegas. A sequel film titled Planet of the Dead is also in the works. Based on Snyder\u2019s current Netflix track record, we can assume that Rebel Moon will follow a similar trajectory.

The cautious rollout is the company\u2019s first public effort to address the recent chatbot craze driven by OpenAI and Microsoft, and it is meant to demonstrate that Google is capable of providing similar technology.

The game was played on February 12, 2023, at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. It was the fourth Super Bowl hosted by the Phoenix metropolitan area, and the third at this venue, with the most recent previously being Super Bowl XLIX in 2015 (then known as University of Phoenix Stadium).[6]  Both teams finished the regular season with a league-best 14\u20133 record. This was the Eagles fourth Super Bowl appearance overall and the second in the last six seasons, having previously won Super Bowl LII; the Eagles previously lost Super Bowls XV and XXXIX. This was the Chiefs' fifth Super Bowl appearance overall and third in the last four seasons, having previously won Super Bowls IV and LIV, and losses in Super Bowls I and LV.  After the Eagles went into halftime up 24\u201314, the Chiefs mounted a comeback to win the game 38\u201335 with a game-winning field goal kicked by Harrison Butker. Butker's game winning kick was set up by a pivotal and controversial defensive holding call on Philadelphia cornerback James Bradberry, which was criticized by some observers but supported by others.","Jaccard Noise_80":1.0,"Cosine Noise_80":0.9999998808,"EM Noise_80":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":1,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"Philadelphia Eagles","Noise_100 Document Index":"0","Noise_100 Document":"Feb 9, 2023 ...

The technology has stoked controversy over its potential to spread misinformation and hate speech, as well as efforts taken by some designers to moderate responses in order to limit such outcomes. In March, Musk signed onto an open letter with some other industry leaders raising concerns about the potential negative impact of AI and calling for a six-month pause in development of the technology. XAI adds a new company to Musk's portfolio roughly one month after he officially stepped down as Twitter CEO. He retained a prominent role in the company as its executive chairman and chief technology officer. The AI startup will \"work closely\" with Tesla and Twitter but remain separate, according to the new company's website. Musk acknowledged that the new company remains in its infancy. \"XAI is just starting out here,\" he said, adding that he expects it \"to be a while\" before the company's offering reaches a scale on par with products from OpenAI or Google.

While working as a scrapper on the planet Bracca, trying to hide his identity from the Empire, Cal uses the Force to rescue his friend Prauf during a work accident, exposing him as a Jedi to the Empire, who subsequently dispatches two Inquisitors, the Second Sister and the Ninth Sister, to capture him.","Jaccard Noise_40":0.5,"Cosine Noise_40":0.771117568,"EM Noise_40":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":0,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"Merrin","Noise_60 Document Index":"0","Noise_60 Document":"Apr 28, 2023 ...

Peele's use of humor in the 2017 movie also taught Manzoor something very important: \"I didn't realize how much you could use comedy to help keep the audience with you.\" Kill Bill is one of the many films to inspire the action sequences in Polite Society.

Since it premiered within a week of Abbott Elementary in December of 2021, it\u2019s the show I\u2019ve been telling everyone and their cousin to catch up on once they\u2019re up to date with Janine and her fellow Philly teachers. I\u2019ve even gone long on it here in Paste\u2019s digital pages. So it was an immediate YES, then, when the series\u2019 press team reached out to connect me with series creator and showrunner Phil Augusta Jackson in advance of the Season 2 finale. Considering that the last few episodes of the season brought fans the shocking and sad twist that original Crew member Fay (Grasie Mercedes) would be leaving LA to take on managerial duties at a Grand Cru wine bar spin-off out in New York City, this was a call I was more than ready to take. And while the conversation didn\u2019t quite turn to what might be in Grand Crew\u2019s now Fay-less Season 3 future\u2014or even if, indeed, it\u2019s likely to see such a future\u2014it was nevertheless a delight. Enjoy the conversation, and then get back to streaming Season 2! The world deserves as much Grand Crew as Jackson (and NBC) are willing to make.\u00a0 Note: The following conversation has been lightly edited for clarity and length.

After being announced at Google I\/O in May, Google's first foldable is just now getting some release updates, this time from AT&T and Verizon.\u00a0 On Tuesday, AT&T announced that it will begin its own preorders for the Pixel Fold and introduced a deal that offered new and existing AT&T users\u00a0the Pixel Fold for $25 per month\u00a0without needing to trade in a device. To get that discount you will need to be on an unlimited plan and commit to a 36-month installment plan.\u00a0 All told, the carrier is willing to cover $900, or half of the Pixel Fold's regular $1,799 starting price for the 256GB model (not including taxes). Oddly, purchasing the 256GB model outright from the carrier is $1,880, or $81more than the unlocked version you could buy directly from Google.\u00a0 Verizon previously said it would begin accepting preorders for the foldable on June 20, and said the device would go on sale on June 27.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.5,"Cosine Noise_100":0.8770037889,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

The Office Assistant used technology initially from Microsoft Bob and later Microsoft Agent, offering advice based on Bayesian algorithms.  The default assistant in the English version was named Clippit[1][2][3][4] (sometimes later called \"Clippy\"), after a paperclip.

{"Query":"What is the name of Google's AI image editing tool?","Correct Answer":["Magic Editor"],"Noise_0 Predicted Answer":"Magic Editor","Noise_0 Document Index":"4","Noise_0 Document":"By  Emma Roth, a news writer who covers the streaming wars, consumer tech, crypto, social media, and much more. Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.  One of the most impressive demos at Google I\/O started with a photo of a woman in front of a waterfall. A presenter onstage tapped on the woman, picked her up, and moved her to the other side of the image, with the app automatically filling in the space where she once stood. They then tapped on the overcast sky, and it instantly bloomed into a brighter cloudless blue. In just a matter of seconds, the image had been transformed. The AI-powered tool, dubbed the Magic Editor, certainly lived up to its name during the demo. It\u2019s the kind of tool that Google has been building toward for years. It already has a couple of AI-powered image editing features in its arsenal, including the Magic Eraser, which lets you quickly remove people or objects from the background of an image. But this type of tool takes things up a notch by letting you alter the contents \u2014 and potentially, the meaning \u2014 of a photo in much more significant ways. While it\u2019s clear that this tool isn\u2019t flawless\u00a0\u2014 and there remains no firm release date for it \u2014 Google\u2019s end goal is clear: to make perfecting photos as easy as just tapping or dragging something on your screen.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.9999998808,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Magic Editor","Noise_20 Document Index":"0","Noise_20 Document":"May 10, 2023 ...

That includes the ability to enhance the sky, move and scale subjects, as well as remove parts of an image with just a few taps. Google\u2019s Magic Editor attempts to package all the steps that it would take to make similar edits in a program like Photoshop into a single tap \u2014 or, at least, that\u2019s what it looks like from the demo. In Photoshop, for example, you\u2019re stuck using the Content-Aware Move tool (or any of the other methods of your choice) to pick up and move a subject inside of an image. Even then, the photo still might not look quite right, which means you\u2019ll have to pick up other tools, like the Clone Stamp tool or maybe even the Spot Healing Brush, to fix any leftover artifacts or a mismatched background. It\u2019s not the most complicated process ever, but as with most professional creative tools, there\u2019s a definite learning curve for people who are new to the program. I\u2019m all for Google making photo editing tools free and more accessible, given that Photoshop and some of the other image editing apps out there are expensive and pretty unintuitive. But putting powerful and incredibly easy-to-use image editing tools into the hands of, well, just about everyone who downloads Google Photos could transform the way we edit \u2014 and look at \u2014 photos.","Jaccard Noise_40":1.0,"Cosine Noise_40":0.9999998808,"EM Noise_40":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":1,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"Imagen Editor","Noise_60 Document Index":"4","Noise_60 Document":"Jun 12, 2023 ...

This week we saw the arrival of its new Photo Unblur feature, the latest in an increasingly impressive line of AI editing tools.\u00a0 Just like 90s Photoshop, Google's tricks are opening up image manipulation to a wider audience, while challenging our definition of what a photo actually is.  As its name suggests, Photo Unblur (currently exclusive to the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro) can automatically turn your old, blurry snaps into crisp, shareable memories. And it's the latest example of Google's desire to build a robot Photoshop into its phones (and ultimately, Google Photos).

At its annual developer conference, Apple also introduced a raft of new products and features, including a 15-inch MacBook Air, a powerful chip called M2 Ultra, improvements to its iOS software and a long-awaited tweak to prevent its autocorrect from annoyingly changing a common expletive to \"ducking\". The Vision Pro will start at $3,499, more than three times the cost of the priciest headset in Meta's line of mixed and virtual reality devices. The headset will test a market crowded with devices that have yet to gain traction with consumers and put it in direct competition with Facebook-owner Meta after years of clashes between the companies over issues like user privacy and control of developer platforms. Apple emphasized the novelty of the headset's augmented reality features as well as the sports and entertainment partnerships it would offer. The device will use a new chip called R1 that will process information from its sensors in less time than the blink of an eye, Apple said. But the announcements failed to excite Wall Street, which had bid up Apple shares to a record high ahead of the launch.

Families need a better spectrum of care, and women in particular need better access to healthcare providers that specialize in their unique needs. Maven, which was founded in 2014 when telemedicine was first starting to take off, aspires to solve both of these problems, helping millions find support in areas like fertility, pregnancy, adoption, parenting, and pediatrics.
