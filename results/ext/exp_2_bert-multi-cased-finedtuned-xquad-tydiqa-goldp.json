The Troubadour shows took place over a series of days in November 2007 with the international concert tour following in 2010. Marshall is privy to exclusive footage from the tour. Both King and Taylor reminisce on their 50-year relationship during exclusive interviews. They also discuss the history behind the songs. Taylor even mentions wanting King to be apart of his band.

Here\u2019s how it works. Sophia Bush is back on TV for Good Sam, and here's how the CBS drama compares to other current medical shows. Spoilers ahead for the series premiere of Good Sam on CBS. CBS has officially gotten into the medical drama game with the debut of Good Sam, starring Sophia Bush in her big series regular return to network television after her exit from Chicago P.D. in 2017. As Dr. Sam Griffith, Bush \u2013\u00a0in her first turn playing a doctor on TV \u2013\u00a0takes on a leadership role at her hospital by becoming chief of surgery\u2026 with the complication that her father (played by Jason Isaacs) formerly held that position before ending up in a coma after being shot. When he awakes and must work under his daughter, there are more problems than just medical mysteries for Sam to deal with.\u00a0 The show packed a lot into the pilot episode to establish not only Sam and dad Rob \u201cGriff\u201d Griffith, but also her mom and her team of doctors who are used to following Griff\u2019s lead rather than Sam\u2019s. CBS was the only broadcast network without a medical drama prior to Good Sam, and recruiting a TV veteran like Sophia Bush and a big name like Jason Isaacs was a strong way to start.

Bertozzi called this \u201cbioorthogonal\u201d chemistry in a paper\u00a0she and her colleagues published that year. The term has since been\u00a0widely-adopted term in the field. The ability to perform complex reactions in living systems without interfering with natural biological reactions made it possible to study molecules and cellular processes in cells and inside complex organisms such as zebra fish, rather than in laboratory dishes. It has already helped scientists understand an important protein processing reaction called glycosylation, helped to develop molecular imaging molecules that could detect disease in living organisms, and opened up the possibility of selectively delivering drugs to particular tissues in the body. These findings have \u201cled to a revolution in how chemists think about linking molecules together and how to do it in living cells,\u201d \u00c5qvist said.

Russia's President Vladimir Putin has given varying public explanations for why he launched the invasion. Here are the reasons Putin gave, how they match with reality, and the other likely reasons why Russia sent its armed forces into an independent, sovereign nation. Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union, before declaring itself an independent country, cementing the move in a referendum days before the USSR collapsed in December 1991. The country has maintained its independence ever since. But Putin still refers to Ukraine as Russian, and denies it's a nation in its own right. He told then-US President George W. Bush in 2008 that Ukraine wasn't even a country. Stephen Hall, a Russian politics expert at the University of Bath in the UK, said many Russians still hold this view, and that \"it isn't just the Kremlin.\" Hall said Russia sees Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, as the \"mother of Russian cities,\" and for Putin he can't have that being outside his own country. Hall added that Russia needs to claim Ukraine in order to back up its argument to being a great power that has existed for millennia. Without it \"Russia can't claim a thousand years of history because Kyiv was already in existence 1,200 years ago, when Moscow was a forest,\" he said.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.6666666667,"Cosine Noise_0":0.8160431981,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Feb. 24","Noise_20 Document Index":"0","Noise_20 Document":"People take cover as an air-raid siren sounds, near an apartment building damaged by recent shelling in Kyiv, Ukraine February 26, 2022.

At this point, nothing has been officially announced with both FromSoftware and Publisher Bandai Namco avoiding any concrete answers on the future of the game. That being said, FromSoftware does have a history of releasing DLC for their previous titles. Dark Souls 1-3, Bloodborne and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice all received hefty post-launch support and content updates. There have also been hints in press releases, with one including a quote from Bandai Namco Entertainment President and CEO Yasuo Miyakawa which talks about \u201cexpanding the brand beyond the game itself\u201d.

It helps that \u201cDog,\u201d which Tatum co-directed and starred in, was a recent theatrical hit, but Hollywood will also look to coming films like \u201cThe Lost City\u201d and \u201cBullet Train\u201d (a Pitt-led action comedy in which Bullock returns the favor with a cameo of her own) to determine whether there\u2019s a path for big studio movies outside the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The hope is that audiences are still eager to see movie stars being movie stars, and as Bullock, Tatum and Radcliffe playfully ribbed each other during the Zoom call, their screen chemistry was evident. At one point, when Tatum was interrupted by the appearance of a Dutch shepherd straining to lick his face, Bullock rolled her eyes. \u201cThis is a plug for \u2018Dog,\u2019\u201d she joked. \u201cBeautifully timed, Channing.\u201d Here are edited excerpts from our conversation.","Jaccard Noise_60":0.5,"Cosine Noise_60":0.3876055479,"EM Noise_60":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_60":0,"Noise_80 Predicted Answer":"Barbie","Noise_80 Document Index":"8","Noise_80 Document":"Movies in theaters Movies at home More Certified fresh picks                New TV Tonight                             Most Popular TV on RT              More                Certified fresh pick              Columns Guides The Best TV Seasons Certified Fresh at 100% 10 Fresh William Friedkin Movies Hubs RT25: Celebrating 25 Years of Rotten Tomatoes What to Watch: In Theaters and On Streaming RT News Best Directors of the Last 25 Years: Vote in Round 2 Weekend Box Office Results: Barbie Joins the $1 Billion Club Play all videos 2022, Romance\/Comedy, 1h 52m   Critics Consensus   The Lost City doesn't sparkle quite as brightly as some classic treasure-hunting capers, but its stars' screwball chemistry make this movie well worth romancing.

This guide highlights everything you need to know about the M2 chip, from performance improvements to extra features.    The M2 is Apple's next-generation System on a Chip (SoC) developed for use in Macs and iPads. It marks Apple's continued work to transition away from the Intel chips that were used in Macs up until 2020. As a \"System on a Chip,\" the M2 integrates several different components, including the CPU, GPU, unified memory architecture (RAM), Neural Engine, Secure Enclave, SSD controller, image signal processor, encode\/decode engines, Thunderbolt controller with USB 4 support, and more, all of which power the different features in the Mac. Before Apple silicon, Macs used multiple chips for CPU, I\/O, and security, but Apple's effort to integrate these chips is the reason why the M2 is much faster and more efficient than Intel chips. The unified memory architecture that Apple has included is also a major factor because all of the technologies in the M2 are able to access the same data without having to swap between multiple pools of memory. Built into the M2 chip, the unified memory architecture means the CPU, GPU, and other processor components don't need to copy data between one another, and are able to access the same data pool.","Jaccard Noise_40":0.3333333333,"Cosine Noise_40":0.7838338614,"EM Noise_40":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":0,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"June 6, 2022","Noise_60 Document Index":"0","Noise_60 Document":"Text of this article June 6, 2022 PRESS RELEASE Apple unveils M2, taking the breakthrough performance and capabilities of M1 even further M2 delivers new levels of power-efficient performance and capabilities to the completely redesigned MacBook Air and updated 13-inch MacBook Pro CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA\u00a0Apple today announced M2, beginning the next generation of Apple silicon designed specifically for the Mac.\u00a0Built using second-generation 5-nanometer technology, M2 takes the industry-leading performance per watt of M1 even further with an 18 percent faster CPU, a 35 percent more powerful GPU, and a 40 percent faster Neural Engine.1 It also delivers 50 percent more memory bandwidth compared to M1, and up to 24GB of fast unified memory.

The awards were scheduled after their usual late February date to avoid conflicting with both the 2022 Winter Olympics and Super Bowl LVI, with the latter being held in nearby Inglewood, California.[3] During the gala, the AMPAS presented Academy Awards (commonly referred to as Oscars) in 23 categories honoring films released from March 1 to December 31, 2021. The ceremony, televised in the United States by ABC, was produced by Will Packer and Shayla Cowan and was directed by Glenn Weiss.[4] Actresses Regina Hall, Amy Schumer, and Wanda Sykes hosted the show for the first time.[5] Two days earlier, in an event held at the Ray Dolby Ballroom of the Ovation Hollywood complex in Hollywood, the Academy held its 12th annual Governors Awards ceremony.[6]  CODA won three awards, including Best Picture. Other winners included Dune with six awards, The Eyes of Tammy Faye with two, and Belfast, Cruella, Drive My Car, Encanto, King Richard, The Long Goodbye, No Time to Die, The Power of the Dog, The Queen of Basketball, Summer of Soul, West Side Story and The Windshield Wiper with one.","Jaccard Noise_20":0.6666666667,"Cosine Noise_20":0.8082171082,"EM Noise_20":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":1,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"Sunday, March 12, 2023","Noise_40 Document Index":"3","Noise_40 Document":"To revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.

By Radhika Seth The 2022 Oscars were historic to say the least: Apple TV+\u2019s life-affirming CODA became the first film released by a streaming service to win best picture; its raucous star Troy Kotsur became the first deaf man to secure an acting Oscar; West Side Story\u2019s Ariana DeBose became the first openly queer woman of color to scoop best supporting actress; and, before he took home best actor, Will Smith was involved in a jaw-dropping viral moment which will be remembered for decades to come. So, what on earth will the 2023 ceremony bring? Here\u2019s everything we know so far. The 95th Academy Awards will be held on Sunday, March 12, 2023. The Oscars ceremony will air live on ABC from 8:00pm ET, as well as on streaming services including Hulu Live TV, YouTubeTV, and FuboTV. For red carpet arrivals, tune in to E! at 5:00pm Eastern.

G. Wells' 1901 novel The First Men in the Moon (also relating to the first voyagers to the Moon) the protagonist, Mr. Bedford, mentions Verne's novel to his companion, Professor Cavor, who replies (in a possible dig at Verne) that he does not know what Bedford is referring to. Verne returned the dig later when he pointed out that he used gun cotton to send his men to the Moon, an actual substance. \"Can Mr. Wells show me some 'cavourite'?\", he asked archly.  The novel (along with Wells' The First Men in the Moon) inspired the first science fiction film, A Trip to the Moon, made in 1902 by Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s. In 1958, another film adaptation of this story was released, titled From the Earth to the Moon. It was one of the last films made under the RKO Pictures banner. The story also became the basis for the very loose adaptation Jules Verne's Rocket to the Moon (1967), a caper-style British comedy starring Burl Ives and Terry-Thomas. The 1961 Czechoslovak film The Fabulous Baron Munchausen combines characters and plot elements from the Verne novel with those of the stories of Baron Munchausen and Cyrano de Bergerac.[citation needed]","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.5129055381,"EM Noise_100":0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

Mr. Musk, who is one of Twitter\u2019s most active users and has more than 109 million followers, began accumulating shares in the company this year. In April, he struck the deal to buy the company for $44 billion and said he would lift Twitter\u2019s content moderation policies, eliminate spam, add new features and provide more transparency about the algorithms used to promote content. \u201cTwitter has tremendous potential \u2014 I look forward to working with the company and the community of users to unlock it,\u201d he said in a statement in April. But, within weeks, he began questioning the deal. Mr. Musk lashed out at the Twitter executives responsible for content decisions and accused the company of failing to accurately count the spam accounts on its platform. When Parag Agrawal, Twitter\u2019s chief executive, tried debunking Mr. Musk\u2019s claims, Mr. Musk responded by tweeting a poop emoji. By July, Mr. Musk had decided that he no longer wanted to own Twitter, arguing that he had been misled about the amount of spam on the platform. He announced his intent to abandon the acquisition. Twitter sued Mr. Musk to force him to carry out the agreement. The company accused Mr. Musk of trying to back out of the deal because the economic downturn had caused a decline in his personal wealth. Mr. Musk had agreed to personally provide roughly $33 billion of the $44 billion deal.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.9033486843,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"$44 billion","Noise_20 Document Index":"2","Noise_20 Document":"By\u00a0         Wailin Wong       ,\u00a0         Darian Woods       ,\u00a0        Nicky Ouellet         ,\u00a0         Kate Concannon       Yes, Elon Musk is the richest person in the world.

Bloomberg's Mark Gurman claims that Apple's iPhone 14 Pro will get a massive camera update, with the phone's main (wide) sensor being bumped up to 48-megapixels. If accurate, this would be one of the biggest upgrades Apple has made to the iPhone, which has had a 12-megapixel main camera sensor since the release of iPhone 6s in 2015.  However, Gurman says only the Pro models will get the 48-megapixel camera, while the regular iPhone models will have a 12-megapixel main sensor. Also, for the first time, only the Pro models will get Apple's new A16 chip, while the regular variants will either have the A15 (the same chip that powers the iPhone 13) or some variant of it.  Apple typically adds several big upgrades in terms of camera hardware on its Pro models; in the last couple of iterations, the difference was that the Pro models came with an additional telephoto camera on the back. But the standard and the Pro iPhone typically had the same (or very similar) main, wide camera; if Gurman's report is accurate, this will no longer be the case.

While we can dedicate an entire post to the details of camera sensors, allow me to briefly explain the benefits. Apple has a few main desires when it comes to its camera. Resolution was not the only reason to move to a more advanced, larger and higher pixel-count sensor.

They were essentially treated as disposable.  Now on-set animal action, in the United States at least, is monitored by the nonprofit American Humane.

For years now, Musk has stated that Tesla would keep gradually increasing the price of its Full Self-Driving (FSD) package as functionality improves leading to the actual final form of the product, which is, as its name suggests, the capacity to fully drive autonomously.  However, the feature hasn\u2019t lived up to its name so far. It has been in beta for two years now, and it is still far from self-driving. Technically, the system is able to both activate and attempt to drive in most areas, including across intersections, but the responsibility remains with the driver, who needs to be paying attention at all times and be ready to take control. Many see the willingness to take responsibility for the system as the most important step companies developing self-driving systems can take toward achieving this goal. Tesla has made it clear that it is not there yet and participating in the FSD Beta comes with a bunch of warnings that make it clear the responsibility is still with the driver. But Tesla sees every new FSD update as a step closer to the goal, and it believes that some of those updates even warrant price increases for the package.

Now the California resident is surprised to see that Tesla is raising the price of \u201cfull self-driving\u201d to $15,000 even as it falls short of the automaker\u2019s projections.            \u201cI would never even pay $10,000 for it,\u201d Al-Rawi told CNN Business. \u201cThey overpromised like crazy.\u201d","Jaccard Noise_80":1.0,"Cosine Noise_80":0.9999999404,"EM Noise_80":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":1,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"$199 a month","Noise_100 Document Index":"2","Noise_100 Document":"Tesla buyers can purchase \u201cfull self-driving\u201d outright when they buy their car, or they may opt to pay a monthly subscription fee to use the feature.

Williams edged finalists Max Duggan of TCU, C.J. Stroud of Ohio State and Stetson Bennett IV of Georgia -- all quarterbacks -- to become the Trojans' first Heisman winner since running back Reggie Bush, who was later forced to vacate his 2005 award. Williams passed for 4,075 yards, 37 touchdowns and just four interceptions while completing 66.1% of his passes this season. He guided USC to an 11-2 record and appearance in the Pac-12 Championship Game where he played through injuries in a loss to Utah. His victory gives USC eight Heismans, most among any program in the nation. However, given the Heisman Trust and NCAA no longer recognize Bush as having won the trophy in 2005, USC will be listed with seven Heismans, tying it for most all-time with Notre Dame, Ohio State and Oklahoma.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.9999999404,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Bryce Young","Noise_20 Document Index":"4","Noise_20 Document":"Though injuries to a hamstring and a finger on his throwing hand hampered him in the Pac-12 title game, he still passed for 363 yards and three touchdowns in the loss to keep his case strong as the voting deadline neared.\u00a0 Like 2021 Heisman Trophy winner Bryce Young of Alabama, Williams is expected to play another season of college football as he will not be eligible for the NFL Draft until after his junior season.

The film was set to be directed by Gore Verbinski, director of the Pirates of the Caribbean series. However, it was announced on August 24, 2009 that because of budget issues, and the prospect of filming some footage overseas, Verbinski had dropped out as director.[1] Verbinski remained as the film's producer, and was working with the new director, Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, who is best known for his horror sequel 28 Weeks Later, to manage the film's budget. The pre-production on the BioShock film was cancelled sometime in late 2010 or early 2011.  In 2022 it was announced that the film was back in development and would be a Netflix exclusive film. That same year, the film found both it's director and writer in Francis Lawrence and Michael Green respectively.  In early July of 2010 Verbinski announced that he was still active on the film, and that he and Fresnadillo were working to reduce the budget and produce the film with an R-rating.[2]  In February 2011 Verbinski confirmed that pre-production on the BioShock film has stopped because no studio was willing to invest in such an expensive project with a violent theme.[3]","Jaccard Noise_0":0.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.4128765166,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":0,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Francis Lawrence","Noise_20 Document Index":"8","Noise_20 Document":"Aug 26, 2022 ...

The newspaper obtained the settlement information through a public records request. The lawsuit was settled earlier this month, as Stollings alleged discrimination and retaliation against the school and athletic director Kirby Hocutt. On Aug. 6, 2020, Hocutt fired Stollings, a day after a USA Today report alleged that Stollings had created a toxic and abusive culture within the Texas Tech program. She was 32-28 in two seasons at Texas Tech and had four years remaining on her contract when she was fired. Twelve players left Texas Tech during Stollings' time as coach there -- eight after her first season and four after the second. Stollings told ESPN in 2020 that in taking over a program that went 7-23 overall and 1-17 in the Big 12 in 2017-18, she needed to make massive changes. She said Texas Tech's administration was \"very clear on what the program was lacking\" when she came in.

Full details of the decision are expected to be published next week, a commission spokesman said Tuesday.\u00a0 Meta confirmed the fine and said it plans to appeal the decision.\u00a0 \"This inquiry focused on old settings that we updated over a year ago, and we've since released many new features to help keep teens safe and their information private,\" a Meta spokesperson told CNET via email on Tuesday. \"Anyone under 18 automatically has their account set to private when they join Instagram, so only people they know can see what they post, and adults can't message teens who don't follow them.\"\u00a0 The spokesperson added that Meta disagrees with how the fine was calculated and is reviewing the rest of the commission's decision.

While investigating the events that led to their mentor's demise, the heroes become embroiled in an ancient conflict between two secret organizations fighting for control of Gotham: the Court of Owls and the League of Shadows.

Players can freely move around Gotham City, interacting with characters, undertaking missions, and gaining experience points and other resources to level up their characters and equipment. Outside of the story, players are able to complete side missions to unlock additional content and collectible items. A cooperative online multiplayer mode is also included, allowing two players to play through the single-player campaign together while progressing in their own game.

Shaw's expressed views were often contentious; he promoted eugenics and alphabet reform, and opposed vaccination and organised religion. He courted unpopularity by denouncing both sides in the First World War as equally culpable, and although not a republican, castigated British policy on Ireland in the postwar period. These stances had no lasting effect on his standing or productivity as a dramatist; the inter-war years saw a series of often ambitious plays, which achieved varying degrees of popular success.

Watch the ceremony in the video player above. At a coronation with displays of royal power straight out of the Middle Ages, Charles was given an orb, a sword and scepter and had the solid gold, bejeweled St. Edward\u2019s Crown placed atop his head as he sat upon a 700-year-old oak chair. In front of world leaders, foreign royals, dignitaries and a smattering of stars, the monarch declared, \u201cI come not to be served but to serve,\u201d and was presented as Britain\u2019s \u201cundoubted king.\u201d Inside the medieval abbey, trumpets sounded, and the congregation of more than 2,000 shouted \u201cGod save the king!\u201d Outside, thousands of troops, hundreds of thousands of spectators and scores of protesters converged. It was the culmination of a seven-decade journey for the king from heir to monarch.","Jaccard Noise_60":0.0,"Cosine Noise_60":0.4955255985,"EM Noise_60":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_60":0,"Noise_80 Predicted Answer":"Saturday 10 September","Noise_80 Document Index":"3","Noise_80 Document":"He was proclaimed king by the Accession Council of the United Kingdom on Saturday 10 September, which was followed by proclamations in other Commonwealth realms\u00a0...","Jaccard Noise_80":0.0,"Cosine Noise_80":0.572533071,"EM Noise_80":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":0,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"2 June 1953","Noise_100 Document Index":"3","Noise_100 Document":"To revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.

Besides King Charles III and Queen Consort Camilla, the entire Wales family was present at the Coronation, with Prince George acting as one of the Pages of Honour during the service. Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis were also in attendance, traveling with Kate, William, and George in the carriage procession back to Buckingham Palace after the ceremony. The Duke of Sussex was among the congregation, too, although he kept a low profile, while the Duchess of Sussex remained at home in California with Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet. The ceremony was held on May 6\u2014more than eight months after the passing of Queen Elizabeth II and shortly before the 70th anniversary of the Queen\u2019s coronation.

{"Query":"What is Trace Adkins' role in \"Monarch\"?","Correct Answer":["Albie Roman"],"Noise_0 Predicted Answer":"country singer","Noise_0 Document Index":"4","Noise_0 Document":"Fox's latest musical drama brings viewers along for the radio in this tale about a fictional country music empire. One of the most recognizable genres of music, country music has seen its fair share of stars and dynasties throughout its years. Fox\u2019s new musical drama Monarch is out to capture the intrigue of the country music scene. The synopsis that Fox provides is tantalizing: Reigning King of Country Music Albie Roman, along with his insanely talented -- and tough as nails -- wife, Queen of Country Music Dottie Cantrell Roman, have created a country music dynasty, but even though the Roman name is synonymous with authenticity, the very foundation of their success is a lie. When their reign as country royalty is put in jeopardy, heir to the crown Nicolette \u201cNicky\u201d Roman will stop at nothing to protect her family\u2019s legacy, while ensuring her own quest for stardom, alongside her brother Luke and sister Gigi. The trailer very much confirms the synopsis. With characters oozing secrets, betrayals, fistfights, guns, bright lights, and country music, there\u2019s enough content here for a whole album\u2019s worth of country music lyrics. Importantly, we are introduced to the major players in the series, most of them members of the Roman family. Created by Melissa London Hilfers, the series promises an epic drama with familiar actors and names from the country music scene including starring roles from Susan Sarandon and country singer Trace Adkins.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.1439207643,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":0,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Catt Phoenix","Noise_20 Document Index":"6","Noise_20 Document":"Although is his first stint in Hollywood, Pascual is known for his Filipino television and film roles including the television drama series And I Love You So and the romantic films Crazy Beautiful You and Relaks, It's Just Pag-ibig.

Midway through the world premiere screening of Susie Searches, I sat as hot, electric colors slashed across the screen, as zany, canned sound effects erupted from the speakers, and as lines with clear comic intent left the mouths of characters and seemed to freeze mid-air, shiver, and falter over a silent, stone-faced audience. And I wondered \u2014 what is going on? Susie Searches is the feature debut of Los Angeles-based actress, writer, and director Sophie Kargman. In 2020, Kargman co-wrote (with William Day Frank) and directed a short version of this feature. The primary difference here is Kargman swapping herself out as the lead actress for Kiersey Clemons, whose star-making opportunity has eluded her since her promising breakout in 2015\u2019s Dope. Now, we know why.

This is the winsome yet disturbing journey at the center of Susie Searches.\u00a0 Kiersey Clemons stars as Susie Wallis, a socially awkward college student with a mind for solving mysteries. Naturally, she has her own true crime podcast called Susie Searches, so when fellow student\/meditation influencer Jesse (Alex Wolff) goes missing, her interest in cracking the case isn't exactly selfless. If she finds the internet-adored victim, she and her podcast could score the validation she desperately craves.

The ceremony took place a day after Meloni along with her coalition partners \u2013 hardliner Matteo Salvini of the League party and Forza Italia\u2019s TV tycoon Silvio Berlusconi \u2013 unveiled their cabinet. The government is expected to face confidence votes in parliament next week. Forza Italia\u2019s Antonio Tajani is now the country\u2019s foreign minister.

It had been a chaotic race, stalled by rain and then restarted, before the chaos continued afterwards with confusion reigning over whether Verstappen had defended his title.           For much of the race, it seemed as if the Red Bull driver would be forced to wait until the next grand prix in Austin to secure the drivers\u2019 title for the second time in his career as the race was red-flagged due to rain.           When the race did begin again, it was much shortened, seemingly leaving less points available, and with Verstappen\u2019s rival Charles Leclerc crossing the line in second, he seemed mathematically still in the title hunt.

Perez and his fans are right to point out that he's now second in the 2022 standings and has earned Red Bull's trust in doing what Gasly and Alex Albon couldn't in picking up the pieces if Verstappen isn't around to hold them. Plus, his defence\/attack against Lewis Hamilton in 2021 and Leclerc last weekend helped seal Verstappen's two titles. This is all to his credit. But the picture is only rosy if Red Bull keeps winning easily. If another team\/driver combo in the future produces a stiffer challenge than Ferrari\/Leclerc in 2022, then the unbalanced Red Bull line-up will be exposed.

The win meant that Verstappen took the Championship title, leading P\u00e9rez by 113 points, with 112 points still available.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.5,"Cosine Noise_100":0.5599092245,"EM Noise_100":0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

The reveal of Sarah Shahi's\u00a0Black Adam character might confirm the DC hero Iris will appear in the film. Dwayne Johnson is poised to play Black Adam for the DCEU, a role he's been officially attached to since 2014.\u00a0Black Adam, which was recently rescheduled for July 2022, will mark his debut in the franchise.\u00a0Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra, the film will tell the supervillain-turned-anti-hero's origin story. Additionally, it will feature the big screen debut of the Justice Society of America; how exactly they will collide with Black Adam remains to be seen. Black Adam has been in the works for years, but it has suffered more than a few setbacks. A great deal of progress was made in 2020, but the coronavirus pandemic forced the start of filming to be delayed. Luckily, that period of waiting has finally come to an end, as\u00a0Black Adam began filming only days ago. Johnson confirmed the news on social media, along with his excitement at finally playing the DC character. He'll be joined by the likes of Pierce Brosnan (Dr. Fate), Aldis Hodge (Hawkman), and Shahi, whose role up until now has remained a mystery.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":1.0,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Sarah Shahi","Noise_20 Document Index":"1","Noise_20 Document":"Oct 19, 2022 ...

The Pixel Watch release date was October 13, 2022, and since then we're continuing to track the best Pixel Watch deals.\u00a0Note that the Pixel Watch launched alongside the Google Pixel 7 and Google Pixel 7 Pro, which would both make ideal companion devices for the company's smartwatch.\u00a0 The Google Pixel Watch is a simple-looking smartwatch, I might even call it minimalistic. It comes in just one size: 41mm. Those with larger wrists might complain about the lack of a larger option; that said, it fit me perfectly.\u00a0 The face features a rounded design with a 3D glass dome. This raised effect distracts from the display's thick bezel, but doesn't change the fact that a good chunk of the display is unusable. Perhaps my prior experience with Samsung watches is to blame? I can't help but think it's a missed opportunity to incorporate in digital rotating bezel in that space.\u00a0  It seems like no mistake that the Pixel Watch is a \"dark mode\" device.

The core of this review focuses on the Pixel Watch since it's the first time we're seeing how Google is incorporating Fitbit, which it bought in 2019 for about $2.1 billion. The Pixel Watch starts at $350 for Bluetooth and Wi-Fi and $400 for 4G LTE. For smartwatch users, there's not much new here. Heartrate tracking, fitness tracking and sleep tracking have been available for years in products from Fitbit and other companies, notably Apple. I was hoping Google's first Fitbit tie-in would bring some more groundbreaking innovations to the wearable game, especially for the price. The new Apple Watch SE is just $250 and has the same main features as the Pixel Watch. The same is true for Samsung's Galaxy Watch5, which costs $280. Google's Pixel Watch is the company's premium watch, whereas the Apple Watch SE and Galaxy Watch 5 are base models. But the features each offer are pretty similar. The main benefit I can see to the Pixel Watch is the beautiful, inconspicuous design. The round face and domed glass design make the Pixel Watch feel more luxurious. It's also made out of stainless steel, which is more expensive than cheaper aluminum smartwatch base models.","Jaccard Noise_40":0.0,"Cosine Noise_40":0.1513326168,"EM Noise_40":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":0,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"October 6","Noise_60 Document Index":"1","Noise_60 Document":"27][28][29] In an interview with CNET, Park stated that there were no plans to shut down Fitbit, adding that the Google Fit app would co-exist with Fitbit on the Pixel Watch.[30] Google CEO Sundar Pichai was seen wearing a Pixel Watch in September during an interview at the Code 2022 conference.[31][32] Google officially announced the Pixel Watch on October 6, alongside the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro smartphones, at the annual Made by Google event.[33] It became available for pre-orders on the same day, before being released in nine countries on October 13.[34] When asked why Google waited so long before launching the device, Osterloh cited their acquisition of Fitbit and its expansive health platform as the primary catalyst which convinced Google to greenlight the Pixel Watch, adding that the company was committed to first-party wearables.[35]  The Pixel Watch is available in two models, one with and one without support for cellular connectivity.[38] Its case has a diameter of 41\u00a0mm (1.6\u00a0in) and a Gorilla Glass 5 display.

We will answer all of that for you in this article. Please enable JavaScript God of War was released for PlayStation 4 on August 20, 2018. It was until January 14, 2022, that fans of Kratos were able to embark on his epic God-slaying adventures on PC.

Here's what you need to know about him. He lost to Liz Truss in September, but she resigned six weeks later. In the latest leadership contest, Mr Sunak racked up the support of his fellow MPs early, and fast. He crossed the 100 nominations he needed long before the deadline - including from MPs that had previously backed Truss or Boris Johnson. He clashed with the former PM during the previous leadership race, claiming her plan to borrow money during an inflation crisis was a \"fairytale\" that would plunge the economy into chaos. His parents came to the UK from east Africa and are both of Indian origin. Mr Sunak was born in Southampton in 1980, where his father was a GP and his mother ran a pharmacy. He went to the boarding school Winchester College, then studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Oxford, and business at Stanford in America. He is now the first British Asian prime minister. Mr Sunak was first elected as an MP in 2015 - for Richmond in north Yorkshire - but rose quickly, and was made finance minister - or chancellor - in February 2020 under Boris Johnson.  As Mr Johnson's chancellor, Mr Sunak was behind the financial aid during lockdowns - including furlough payments and the \"Eat Out to Help Out\" scheme for restaurants.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.9999999404,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Rishi Sunak","Noise_20 Document Index":"7","Noise_20 Document":"The former chancellor wins Conservative Party leadership contest days after the dramatic resignation of Liz Truss as prime minister.

During his time at Oxford University, Sunak undertook an internship at Conservative Central Office, and joined the Conservative Party. After graduating, Sunak worked for Goldman Sachs and later as a partner at the hedge fund firms The Children's Investment Fund Management and Theleme Partners.  Sunak was elected to the House of Commons for Richmond in North Yorkshire at the 2015 general election. As a backbencher, Sunak supported the successful campaign for Brexit in the 2016 European Union membership referendum.","Jaccard Noise_80":0.3333333333,"Cosine Noise_80":0.8155606389,"EM Noise_80":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":0,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"2015","Noise_100 Document Index":"3","Noise_100 Document":"By\u00a0         Willem Marx                        Rishi Sunak meets supporters at a Conservative Party leadership election in Birmingham, England, in August.

He lost that election to Liz Truss. LONDON \u2014 Rishi Sunak is now all but guaranteed to become Britain's next prime minister after both the leading contenders considered his rivals in the race to replace Liz Truss pulled out before a single vote was cast among members of the Conservative party.  Considered a centrist and pragmatic politician, he emerged in the latest leadership contest as a safe pair of hands to guide the U.K., after Liz Truss' policy proposals around tax cuts and spending shook the government's credibility and spooked markets.  Sunak's rise in British politics has been nothing short of meteoric. After entering Parliament in 2015 after a career in banking, Boris Johnson appointed him just five years later as finance minister \u2014 a role formally known as chancellor of the Exchequer, the U.K.'s Treasury. Sunak will be the first British Asian and nonwhite person to become prime minister. At 42, he'll also be the youngest prime minister in more than 200 years.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.3876169324,"EM Noise_100":0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

Starting Thursday, the ad plan will be available in Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, the U.K., and the U.S. It will then launch in Spain on Nov. 10. At $6.99 per month, Netflix Basic with Ads costs less than half of Netflix\u2019s $15.49 Standard plan and almost a third less than its ad-free $9.99 Basic plan.  In exchange for that lower price tag, subscribers who switch to the ad-supported plan will have to watch an average of five minutes of ads per hour that are set to play before and during movies and TV shows. At launch, ads will be 15 to 30 seconds in length. During an October press call, Netflix chief operating officer and product chief Greg Peters said that new movies coming to Netflix \u201cwill just have a pre-roll\u201d of ads followed by an uninterrupted viewing experience in order to \u201cpreserve that cinematic model.\u201d He added that movies that have \u201cbeen on the service for a while\u201d will have a more \u201ctraditional\u201d mix of pre-roll and mid-roll ads.

It's Netflix's first foray into the ad-supported space \u2014 the streamer has for years resisted putting any advertising on its platform.

Beginning next year, Netflix will push people who borrow accounts to create their own, and will also give account-holders who share their passwords the ability to pay extra to have friends and family on their accounts. Here's what you need to know about Netflix's Basic With Ads tier. The Basic With Ads plan will operate similarly to the Basic plan.

Schumer speaks after Dems projected to keep control of Senate  The 2022 midterm elections shaped up to be some of the most consequential in the nation's recent history, with control of Congress at stake. All 435 seats in the House and 35 of 100 seats in the Senate were on the ballot, as well as several influential gubernatorial elections in battleground states like Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Democrats were defending their narrow majorities in both chambers and retained control of the Senate, though control of the House isn't yet clear. But a Republican flip of the lower chamber would be enough to curtail most of President Joe Biden's legislative agenda and would likely result in investigations against his administration and even his family. Republican Juan Ciscomani will win in his election bid to represent Arizona's 6th Congressional District, ABC News can report, defeating Democrat Kirsten Engel and flipping a House seat for Republicans from retiring Democratic Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick. With 99% of the expected vote in, Ciscomani is leading Engel by 3,502 votes, 50.5%-49.5%. Ciscomani, a longtime aide to Republican Gov.

The most recent data (as of this writing) show an approval rate of 44%. In our graphs, one can see the typical positive association between approval and seat loss\/gain in both the House and Senate. In both instances the correlation is moderately strong:\u00a0 r= 0.61 for the House, r = 0.45 for the Senate. From 1936-2018, near the midterms, six presidents have had approval ratings in the range of 40-45%--like Biden. Those cases involved wide variation in seat loss or gain. The range of outcomes in the Senate was between -9 and +2\u00a0 seats. The average was a loss of 4. In the House, presidents with approval between 40-45%, saw their party lose between 63 and 13 seats, with an average loss of 36 seats.

The Associated Press declared Republican Mike Garcia the winner in California\u2019s 27th congressional district Wednesday, giving the GOP 218 seats, the threshold for the majority needed to take over the lower chamber of Congress. Republican Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy will likely become House speaker when the new Congress convenes early next year after his party nominated him to the position on Tuesday. He will replace Democrat Nancy Pelosi who has held the gavel since 2019.

Democrats were able to flip a few districts, but they suffered overall net losses, narrowly losing key races in New York, Florida and other states. Redistricting after the 2020 Census had given conservatives an edge in several parts of the country.

But there's nothing ordinary about the latest changeover from Jodie Whittaker's 13th Doctor to Ncuti Gatwa, who at this point seems to be destined to be the 15th Doctor. There are many behind-the-scenes changes, from BBC studios to Bad Wolf and the now-majority ownership by Sony Television, plus moving house to Disney+ over here in the states. However, showrunner Russell Davies has thrown in an extra twist, bringing back David Tennant, not to reprise his 10th Doctor but to play \"The 14th Doctor\" in a series of 60th-anniversary specials. It's all a bit distracting and didn't do much for Whittaker's exit, which was massively overshadowed by Davies coming in and doing a not-quite-hostile wholesale takeover of the franchise. It's also not done Gatwa much good either, as his casting, which is historic in multiple ways, has been drowned out by Tennant's return, the disruption of the Doctor count (Gatwa was initially billed as the 14th Doctor, now he's being referred to as the 15th) and the multiple anniversary specials.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.3135372996,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":0,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Ruby Sunday","Noise_20 Document Index":"7","Noise_20 Document":"TV Series November 18, 2022 Millie Gibson has landed the role of Ruby Sunday, the\u00a0Doctor's new companion.

A post shared by Doctor Who (@bbcdoctorwho) Gibson, 18, is officially the youngest companion the show has featured to date. (Before her, Fourth and Fifth Doctor companion Adric, played by 19-year-old Matthew Waterhouse, was the youngest ever.) This is notable for several reasons, but the biggest is that the companion is usually the audience avatar.

The world's biggest party took place at Education City stadium in Doha on Tuesday night when Morocco upset Spain in the 2022 Fifa World Cup round of 16. The vast majority of the 44,000-strong crowd was overwhelmed by emotion after Morocco defender Achraf Hakimi sealed victory with a cheeky panenka penalty kick. Moroccans poured out into the streets of Casablanca, Rabat, Marrakesh, and practically every capital city in Western Europe to celebrate. Even King Mohamed VI joined the jubilant crowds. After the team danced, hugged and cried in the dressing room, coach Walid Regragui made an extremely important declaration in his post-match press conference. \"At some point in Africa, we have to be ambitious and why not win the World Cup, even if it's going to be hard,\" he said.  The declaration was a sign of a paradigm shift in how African nations approach the World Cup, and it is fitting that it came from Regragui, who represents a paradigm-shift in African coaching.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.2673299611,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":0,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Morocco","Noise_20 Document Index":"6","Noise_20 Document":"Dec 10, 2022 ...

The film is tied with Warner Bros.' \"The Batman,\" which also generated $134 million during its domestic opening in March, as the fifth-highest opening of the year, according to data from Comscore.

REUTERS\/Carlos Barria By Danielle Broadway LOS ANGELES, March 12 (Reuters) - Mexican filmmaker Guillermo del Toro's \"Pinocchio\" won the Academy Award for best animated feature film on Sunday, the third Oscar of his career. The haunting stop-motion musical fantasy was inspired by the 1883 Italian novel \"The Adventures of Pinocchio\" by Carlo Collodi, and informed by Gris Grimly's illustrations of the 2002 edition of the book. Del Toro, 58, reimagines the classic story of Pinocchio, a wooden puppet who dreams of being a real boy, who is cared for by carver Geppetto. However, the story of the Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) film is set in Fascist Italy during the interwar period and World War Two. \"Pinocchio\" prevailed over other popular nominees A24's stop-motion film \"Marcel the Shell With Shoes On\" and the Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) 3D animated film \"Turning Red.\" Del Toro has many accolades, including his 2018 Oscar wins for best picture and best director for \"The Shape of Water.","Jaccard Noise_60":1.0,"Cosine Noise_60":0.9961767197,"EM Noise_60":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_60":1,"Noise_80 Predicted Answer":"Guillermo Del Toro's Pinocchio","Noise_80 Document Index":"5","Noise_80 Document":"Here is the full list of winners: Best Picture: \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" Best Actress: Michelle Yeoh, \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" Best Actor: Brendan Fraser, \"The Whale\" Best Director: Daniel Kwan, Daniel Scheinert, \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" Best Original Song: \"Naatu Naatu,\" \"RRR\" Best Documentary Feature: \"Navalny\" Best Adapted Screenplay: \"Women Talking\" Best Original Screenplay: \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" Best Costume Design: \"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever\" Best International Feature: \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" Best Supporting Actor: Ke Huy Quan, \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" Best Animated Feature: \"Guillermo Del Toro's Pinocchio\" Best Visual Effects: \"Avatar: The Way of Water\" Best Cinematography: \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" Best Supporting Actress: Jamie Lee Curtis, \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" Best Film Editing: \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" Best Score: \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" Best Sound: \"Top Gun: Maverick\" Best Production Design: \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" Best Makeup and Hairstyling: \"The Whale\" Best: Documentary (Short Subject): \"The Elephant Whisperers\" Best Short (Animated): \"The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse\" Best Short Film (Live Action): \"An Irish Goodbye","Jaccard Noise_80":1.0,"Cosine Noise_80":0.9961767197,"EM Noise_80":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":1,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"The Windshield Wiper","Noise_100 Document Index":"8","Noise_100 Document":"28] The winner for the Best Animated Short award was The Windshield Wiper, a multilingual Spanish-American film which is adult animated, while another nominee in three categories: Best Animated Feature, Best Documentary Feature, and Best International Feature Film, was Flee, a PG-13 rated animated documentary about an Afghan refugee.

Sofia Boutella stars as Kora, the reluctant hero from a peaceful colony who is about to find she's her people's last hope, in Zack Snyder's REBEL MOON. Cr. Clay Enos\/Netflix \u00a9 2023 Zack Snyder\u2019s next big Netflix project is taking shape! After a long stint at DC, Snyder is now one of Netflix\u2019s most prominent directors, creating the recent zombie apocalypse film Army of the Dead. His next project is the epic sci-fi fantasy Rebel Moon, which will likely be split into two massive features with the potential for spinoff properties. Army of the Dead came out in 2021 and became one of the most-watched movies on the platform and won the Oscars Fan Favorite contest. The heist film already spawned one prequel film, Army of Thieves, and the anime-style spinoff series Lost Vegas. A sequel film titled Planet of the Dead is also in the works. Based on Snyder\u2019s current Netflix track record, we can assume that Rebel Moon will follow a similar trajectory. Netflix officially announced the cast several months ago, but new cast members have been revealed, plus additional details about the movie. Below you\u2019ll find details on everything we know about the film so far. It was previously announced that Sofia Boutella would star in Rebel Moon alongside Djimon Hounsou, Doona Bae, Charlie Hunnam, Ray Risher, Rupert Friend and Stuart Martin.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.4586905539,"EM Noise_100":0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

Ghostface isn't done yet. Scream 6 \u2013 officially titled Scream VI \u2013 will be slicing into cinemas next month, and we can't wait to be reunited with Ghostface. Following the teaser being released in December 2022, Paramount treated us to the full trailer for the horror sequel in January 2023. Not only did it reveal the first look at Kirby's return, it also had us worried for Gale's fate... The follow-up to 2022's \"requel\" Scream moves events to New York City and brings back new favourites such as Jenna Ortega's Tara. However, we will be missing two of the OGs of the series, with only Courteney Cox returning. For more on that and what to expect from Ghostface's comeback, here's everything you need to know about Scream VI. Scream VI was originally set for release on March 31, 2023, but will now arrive in cinemas at the earlier date of March 10, 2023. Filming took place from June-August 2022 and since we've had the trailer now, we're pretty confident\/hopeful that the movie will be released as planned in March 2023.

Scream took on toxic fandom and \"requels\", so we'll have to wait and see what's the target this time around.  Scream VI will be out in cinemas on March 10.

And today, we\u2019re taking another step forward by opening it up to trusted testers ahead of making it more widely available to the public in the coming weeks. Bard seeks to combine the breadth of the world\u2019s knowledge with the power, intelligence and creativity of our large language models. It draws on information from the web to provide fresh, high-quality responses. Bard can be an outlet for creativity, and a launchpad for curiosity, helping you to explain new discoveries from NASA\u2019s James Webb Space Telescope to a 9-year-old, or learn more about the best strikers in football right now, and then get drills to build your skills. Use Bard to simplify complex topics, like explaining new discoveries from NASA\u2019s James Webb Space Telescope to a 9-year-old. We\u2019re releasing it initially with our lightweight model version of LaMDA. This much smaller model requires significantly less computing power, enabling us to scale to more users, allowing for more feedback. We\u2019ll combine external feedback with our own internal testing to make sure Bard\u2019s responses meet a high bar for quality, safety and groundedness in real-world information.

Oh boy, can it be painfully unfunny. Bard, tell me a joke about Washington and it replies:  \u201cWhat do you call a Washington, D.C. resident who\u2019s always late? A Washing-ton.

David Holz, known for co-founding Leap Motion, a company specializing in 3D motion detection technology, founded Midjourney to bring an innovative solution to image creation. The company was founded with the goal of leveraging AI to generate realistic, detailed and engaging images in a variety of fields ranging from art to advertising.  Midjourney uses deep learning algorithms to create AI-generated images. These algorithms are trained on thousands of existing images, allowing them to learn to reproduce different styles, textures and elements. Once training is complete, the algorithms can generate new images by combining the knowledge gained during training.  AI-generated images have tremendous potential in a variety of fields, and Midjourney is at the forefront of these applications. Here are some of the areas where the images generated by Midjourney can be used:  Midjourney promises to revolutionize image creation by offering a faster, cheaper and more creative alternative to traditional methods.

Amazon is drawing criticism for its plan to acquire Roomba maker iRobot for $1.7 billion in an effort to expand its footprint in the home devices and consumer robotics markets. Ron Knox, a senior researcher at the Institute for Local Self Reliance, has called on regulators to challenge the deal, calling it the \"most dangerous, threatening\" acquisition in the e-commerce behemoth's history. In a lengthy Twitter thread on Aug. 5, Knox argued that the deal would take Amazon's biggest rival out of the market and allow it to beat the remaining competition through predatory pricing. \"Jeff Bezos has said that Amazon wants to buy its way to dominance. By snatching up Roomba and pairing it with its vast monopoly power fueled by its Prime system, it would do just that,\" he said. \"There may be other smart vacuums today, but there won't be once Amazon owns Roomba.","Jaccard Noise_20":1.0,"Cosine Noise_20":1.0,"EM Noise_20":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":1,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"Amazon","Noise_40 Document Index":"5","Noise_40 Document":"LuckyStep - stock.adobe.com More than 20 civil rights and data privacy organizations sent a letter Friday to the Federal Trade Commission asking the agency to challenge Amazon's acquisition of iRobot, calling it a privacy and competition threat. Amazon entered into a definitive merger agreement last month to acquire iRobot, maker of the popular Roomba vacuum cleaner. But privacy advocates worry that Amazon will use this product to vacuum up information about consumer homes and private lives. \"Allowing Amazon to absorb a competing smart home device business with access to incredibly detailed consumer data would endanger fair competition and open markets while also jeopardizing consumer privacy,\" according to the letter. The FTC is reportedly looking into Amazon's iRobot acquisition. Acquiring iRobot could provide Amazon with a significant amount of consumer data, said Gartner analyst Bill Ray. Roomba vacuums provide details such as room layouts, the number of rooms in a house and furniture placement. \"The size of your rooms, the thickness of your carpet -- that sort of information is very useful,\" Ray said. \"You can tell a lot about a person by that kind of thing.\" Amazon already knows a significant portion of its customers have more than one Alexa product, with the kitchen being the most popular location, Ray said.

Amazon's Astro robot, which helps with tasks like setting an alarm, was unveiled last year at an introductory price of $1,000. But its rollout has been limited and has received a lackluster response. The company hasn't had much success with household robots, but the iRobot acquisition and the company's strong market reputation provide a \"massive foothold in the consumer robot market\" that could help Amazon replicate the success of its Echo line of smart speakers, said Lian Jye Su, a robotics industry analyst for ABI Research. Su said it also illustrates the shortcomings of consumer robotics vendors like iRobot, which struggled to expand beyond a niche product and was in a \"race-to-the-bottom\" competition with Korean and Chinese manufacturers offering cheaper versions of a robotic vacuum. On Friday, iRobot reported its quarterly results. Revenue plunged 30% primarily on order reductions and delays, and the company announced it was laying off 10% of its workforce.

(AP) \u2014 Three months after losing blue-chip quarterback Jaden Rashada over a failed name, image and likeness deal worth nearly $14 million, the University of Florida is taking advantage of a new state law that allows colleges and coaches to facilitate NIL opportunities. A fundraising collective launched Tuesday, called Florida Victorious, will be able to work with the university to raise money and fund NIL deals for student-athletes. The state law passed in February gives Florida colleges a step up on some of the competition around the country, allowing universities to work directly with booster-run and financed collectives that have mostly been operating as third parties. That was the case for the Gator Collective, the third-party NIL group that had been working with Rashada on his now-failed deal. The Gator Collective was consolidated into Florida Victorious, along with the more exclusive Gator Guard, which had required a $1 million contribution annually. The university hopes the new NIL collective will bring the Gators back to their winning ways.","Jaccard Noise_40":0.0,"Cosine Noise_40":0.3159415126,"EM Noise_40":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":0,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University","Noise_60 Document Index":"7","Noise_60 Document":"Fall Family Weekend 2023 Registration will open on the Hokie Family Hub on July 1.

In December, the company granted a new triannual equity award to Mr. Pichai with a value of $210 million, according to a regulatory filing, consisting of both performance-based and time-based equity.    That grant contains two tranches of performance stock units with a target value of $63 million each, plus a grant of $84 million in the form of Alphabet\u2019s restricted stock units. Alphabet said in the filing that more of the latest stock award would be dependent on performance over time, increasing the proportion of performance stock units to 60% of the total from 43% in 2019.

The prime age labor force participation rate (ages 25 through 54, those in the prime of their working years, being largely done with their education and too young to retire) recovered to its pre-pandemic peak of 83.1% in February and remained unchanged in March. Participation among people ages 55 and older continues to decline; the increasing participation rate represents people under 25 finding or looking for work. These trends suggest that labor scarcity will remain a challenge, particularly in the supply of experienced candidates, and scarcity will continue to support demand for staffing and workforce solutions even as economic growth slows.

Employers will be pleased that labor force participation continues to grow, particularly for prime-age workers.

The US labor market is on a smooth trajectory, but turmoil in the financial market could cause turbulence. This labor market continues to work for workers. Unemployment is very low, but the continued progress in enticing people into the workforce is perhaps more encouraging. The labor force participation rate for workers ages 25 to 54 hit a level previously seen in March 2008, and the last time the employment rate for these workers was this high was May 2001. The number of workers who were unemployed because they had recently lost a job dropped in April, reversing a concerning rise seen in recent months. Payroll job gains continued to moderate, with the three-month moving average ticking down to 222,000 in April, less than half of what it was a year ago. The slowing job gains might concern some people, but this rate of growth is well above the level needed to keep the unemployment rate steady.

At its annual developer conference, Apple also introduced a raft of new products and features, including a 15-inch MacBook Air, a powerful chip called M2 Ultra, improvements to its iOS software and a long-awaited tweak to prevent its autocorrect from annoyingly changing a common expletive to \"ducking\". The Vision Pro will start at $3,499, more than three times the cost of the priciest headset in Meta's line of mixed and virtual reality devices. The headset will test a market crowded with devices that have yet to gain traction with consumers and put it in direct competition with Facebook-owner Meta after years of clashes between the companies over issues like user privacy and control of developer platforms. Apple emphasized the novelty of the headset's augmented reality features as well as the sports and entertainment partnerships it would offer. The device will use a new chip called R1 that will process information from its sensors in less time than the blink of an eye, Apple said.

Design wise, the Vision Pro looks similar to a pair of ski goggles, albeit high-end goggles. It features a laminated glass front, which Apple says was \"three-dimensionally formed.\" The glass is attached to a curved aluminum alloy frame that wraps around the face.

The frame connects magnetically to a Light Seal that sits on the face, and Apple offers the Light Seal in a range of sizes and shapes to fit different faces. A tight fit with the Light Seal is essential for blocking out light and proper operation of the headset. Apple designed the Light Seal to be flexible so that it can conform to individual face shapes.

Ellen McGirt:\u00a0And I have missed those words. This is the most affirming part of my week, and I thank you for it, and hello everyone. Here\u2019s a word of warning: I actually was not able to join Alan for today\u2019s interview, and I am regretting it, because she is such an interesting person and has founded a really interesting, and I would say necessary, company. What do you think, Alan? Murray:\u00a0Yeah, I wish you had been there as well. Kate Ryder is our guest. She\u2019s the founder and CEO of Maven.","Jaccard Noise_20":1.0,"Cosine Noise_20":1.0,"EM Noise_20":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":1,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"Kate Ryder","Noise_40 Document Index":"6","Noise_40 Document":"Checking Accounts Best Credit Cards for Small Business Best Small Business Loans Best Tax Software for Small Business SELECT All Taxes Best Tax Software Best Tax Software for Small Businesses Tax Refunds SELECT All Help for Low Credit Scores Best Credit Cards for Bad Credit Best Personal Loans for Bad Credit Best Debt Consolidation Loans for Bad Credit Personal Loans if You Don't Have Credit Best Credit Cards for Building Credit Personal Loans for 580 Credit Score or Lower Personal Loans for 670 Credit Score or Lower Best Mortgages for Bad Credit Best Hardship Loans How to Boost Your Credit Score SELECT All Investing Best IRA Accounts Best Roth IRA Accounts Best Investing Apps Best Free Stock Trading Platforms Best Robo-Advisors Index Funds Mutual Funds ETFs Bonds  Maven, the women and family health startup, has raised $90 million in a new fundraising round, and in a tough environment for venture funding. The round, led by General Catalyst and with CVS Health Ventures, Intermountain Healthcare's VC arm and European venture firm La Famiglia participating, brings Maven's total capital raised to $300 million. Maven reached unicorn status last August in a $110 million round right before the bottom dropped out of the tech sector. While the downturn in tech is forcing down rounds for some startups, Maven founder and CEO Kate Ryder said in a blog post the latest deal raised its valuation, albeit slightly, to $1.35 billion. Maven has benefitted from greater focus on women's health, particularly since the Supreme Court overturned Roe V.

In front of him was Rory McIlroy, one of golf\u2019s biggest talents who looked ready to end his perplexing nine-year drought in the majors. Next to him in the final group Sunday was Rickie Fowler, a Southern California native who returned from a three-year slump and was poised to finally win his first major.

No stage was bigger than a U.S. Open on the edge of Beverly Hills.
