Their interactions work, and Sophia Bush and Jason Isaacs seem like they could be a great pairing. The other characters around them fail to make much of an impression, except for Sam's mother and Griff's ex-wife, Vivian, who's an administrator at the hospital. Oh, and her new husband is also a doctor there. Adding to the intrigue, Sam's best friend Pippa sleeps with Griff! So, yes, there are some seriously intermingled lives at this hospital, and a fair number of twists in the pilot, but it's not clear where the show\u00a0goes from here, and\/or whether CBS viewers will be invested enough in its characters to care. FINAL RECOMMENDATION: Good Sam is a solid pilot script with a fair number of twists. The father-daughter relationship at its heart is compelling, and Sophia Bush and Jason Isaacs seem well cast. That said, it doesn't feel like it brings much new to the medical show genre overall, and feels far more soapy than we've come to expect from CBS. It's not clear to me where it could fit in their schedule.

It comes from in-house producer Jennie Snyder Urman, who created and executive produced Jane The Virgin. She currently serves as executive producer on the CW\u2019s Charmed and CBS\u2019s midseason sitcom Broke. The writer is Katie Wech, who previously worked with Urman as co-executive producer on Jane the Virgin. Prior to Good Sam, she wrote ABC's pilot The Hypnotist\u2019s Love Story, based on the Liane Moriarty book, which didn't make it to series for good reasons (read my script review). Most recently, she was one of the many writers hired for Fox\u2019s summer series BH90210. This is also the second year CBS has developed a drama pilot for Sophia Bush. In 2019, she headlined Surveillance, a suspenseful spy thriller (read my preview) which reportedly \"tested through the roof\" but was ultimately determined not to be a good fit for the network.

The Blazers reached the Division II title game, earning Goff the head job at FCS McNeese State and helped bring Semore back to Tech, this time as linebackers coach. \u201cHere\u2019s what I love about Semore,\u201d Goff said. \u201cHe\u2019s a great person, but he\u2019s in this profession for the right reason, and that\u2019s to change lives through the sport. He doesn\u2019t have an ego. It\u2019s always the players and the team first, and I really appreciate that.\u201d His coaching acumen, his readiness and selflessness made him Key\u2019s only choice to be his new special-teams coordinator. \u201cHe\u2019s a ball coach,\u201d Key said. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t give him any higher compliment than that.\u201d Relying on help from fellow assistant coaches, Semore taught the new punt-protection scheme on the fly, switching out seven players from the former punting unit.

What microchip shortage? EV maker Tesla, which it should be pointed out produces its own chips in-house, seems not to have been bothered by supply-chain issues all that much in 2021, delivering 936,172 vehicles in the year just ended, according to a report by finance news outlet Finbold. That represents a healthy 87 percent increase over 2020, when the company handed over 499,550 Teslas to customers. Even better for the company, it ended the year with a bang, racking up a record number of sales in the last quarter of 2021, or 308,600 units. Most of that total consisted of Model 3 and Model Y models, no surprise. It\u2019s the sixth consecutive quarter that it breaks its record for sales. In 2019, the automaker delivered 367,500 units, so annual sales growth, while not exponential, is clearly accelerating. The company has said in the past that one its main goals is to attain 50 percent sales growth year after year. Once upon a time, Tesla struggled mightily to hit its delivery targets, but no more. There\u2019s also no sign of that growth slowing down any time soon, even as all-electric rivals join the market by the month. Projections made by Finbold put estimated sales for 2022 at over 1.5 million units, for an increase of close to 65 percent.

The glasses, known internally by the codename Iris, were shelved earlier this year following layoffs, reshuffles, and the departure of Clay Bavor, Google's chief of augmented and virtual reality, according to three people familiar with the matter. A Google spokesperson declined to comment. The Verge first reported on the existence of Project Iris in January 2022, describing the device as resembling a pair of ski goggles. However, Google employees said the \"ski goggles\" were actually the foundations of a separate AR project that's since been announced as a partner product with Samsung, while Iris was a series of devices more closely resembling eyeglasses. Google planned to build and launch Iris as its own product, and it shored up talent through acquisitions. In 2020, the company announced it had purchased North, a Canadian startup that made AR glasses. An early version of Iris closely resembled North's first device, the Focals, while a later version that Google publicly demoed had translation features. Since shelving the Iris glasses, Google has focused on creating software platforms for AR that it hopes to license to other manufacturers building headsets.

He founded WinRumors, a site dedicated to Microsoft news, before joining The Verge in 2012. Lost Ark has comfortably passed 1 million concurrent players after just 24 hours, becoming the second most played game in Steam history by concurrent counts. The Diablo-like MMO launched yesterday in the West, after Amazon Games collaborated with Smilegate RPG to localize and translate Lost Ark and make it available in English. It has now passed concurrent records for both Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and Dota 2, which regularly dominate the top of Steam\u2019s most-played games. Lost Ark is so popular right now that it has experienced server issues and there\u2019s a queue just to start playing. SteamDB lists concurrent players of Lost Ark at 1,311,842, passing CS:GO\u2019s record of 1,308,963 players and Dota 2\u2019s of 1,295,114. It\u2019s not clear exactly how many of those players are actually actively playing the game and not sitting in a server queue, though. Either way, it\u2019s now second place on the top concurrent list behind only PUBG. It still has a long way to go to beat PUBG\u2019s all-time peak of 3,257,248 players. Lost Ark is a second huge hit for Amazon Games, after New World set a concurrent record of 913,634 players four months ago.","Jaccard Noise_20":0.5,"Cosine Noise_20":0.9472259283,"EM Noise_20":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":0,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"February 11,","Noise_40 Document Index":"0","Noise_40 Document":"Update 2\/16\/2022: Amazon Games and Smilegate have announced some updated numbers for Lost Ark's big opening weekend, including a peak of over 1.2 million concurrent viewers on Twitch and over 59.9 million hours watched cumulatively during launch week. Additionally, in the first three days of its launch, Lost Ark gained over 4.7 million new registered players in the West. Original story: Following its official free-to-play launch on February 11, Lost Ark has already become Steam's second most-played game of all time by concurrent players with an all-time peak of 1,325,305 people. As revealed by SteamDB, Lost Ark passed Counter-Strike: Global Offensive's all-time peak of 1,308,963 players to secure the #2 spot. Considering these all-time peaks tend to happen around a game's release, it may be quite an uphill battle to take down PUBG's record of 3,257,248 players at one time. That aside, it's an impressive feat for the MMO that is developed by Smilegate and Tripod Studio and published by Amazon Game Studios. This accomplishment shouldn't come as too much of a surprise as Lost Ark had already become one of Steam's biggest-ever games before it even went free-to-play.

In 2019, the journey culminated in the release of Avengers: Endgame, which premiered to critical and commercial success. It had gone from a story about a playboy billionaire (Tony Stark\/Iron Man) to a larger story than spanned universes as well as heroes and villains alike. Although, as the universe expanded, it was hard to ignore that Marvel\u2019s roster of superheroes still lacked diversity. This was made even more apparent when other superhero stories started to make their way into the mainstream.\u00a0 In the same year that Endgame came out, a quiet and subversive TV show was making waves. The Boys is adapted from a graphic novel of the same name, one that is notorious amongst fans and haters alike for its crude, graphic and violent nature. The series considers what would happen if superheroes existed in the real world. The short answer is that they would become an untouchable commodity that could wreak havoc, which would be cleaned up by their slick and all-powerful parent company Vought.

After a series of humiliating retreats, his initial invasion plan has clearly failed, but Russia's war is far from over. Even now, Russia's leader describes the biggest European invasion since the end of World War Two as a \"special military operation\". Not the full-scale war that has bombed civilians across Ukraine and left more than 13 million either as refugees abroad or displaced inside their own country.  His declared goal on 24 February 2022 was to \"demilitarise and denazify\" Ukraine and not occupy it by force, days after backing independence for eastern Ukrainian territories occupied by Russian proxy forces since 2014.  He vowed to protect people from eight years of Ukrainian bullying and genocide - a Russian propaganda claim with no foundation in reality. He spoke of preventing Nato from gaining a foothold in Ukraine, then added another objective of ensuring Ukraine's neutral status.

He said Putin's strategy is partly \"throw things at the wall and see what sticks.\" According to Graham, there is no evidence that Putin was under public pressure to invade Ukraine, which suggests at least some of his reasoning was personal. All three experts said Putin's desire to be revered in history books likely motivated him to attack. Hall said Putin's anxiety is around \"am I going to be a footnote in Russian history or are they going to write books about me like they do Peter the Great, Catherine the Great, Stalin.\" Taylor agrees, saying that Putin sees himself as \"a great historic Russian leader restoring Russian lands, and he was thinking about his legacy as he turned 70.\" \"What have the great Czars done? They've expanded Russian territory,\" Graham said. Even with all of the above, why the invasion happened when it did is an intriguing question. Experts pointed to multiple reasons why Russia invaded in February 2022. One was the arrival of Zelenskyy, who came to power in 2019 after a career as a comedian and actor.

It was released for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X\/S on February 25 by FromSoftware in Japan and Bandai Namco Entertainment internationally. Players control a customizable player character who is on a quest to repair the Elden Ring and become the new Elden Lord.  Elden Ring is presented through a third-person perspective; players freely roam its interactive open world. The six main areas are traversed using the player character's steed Torrent as the primary mode of travel. Linear, hidden dungeons can be explored to find useful items. Players can use several types of weapons and magic spells, including non-direct engagement enabled by stealth mechanics. Throughout the game's world, checkpoints enable fast travel and allow players to improve their attributes using an in-game currency called Runes. Elden Ring has an online multiplayer mode in which players can join each other for cooperative and player-versus-player combat.  During planning, FromSoftware wanted to create an open-world game with gameplay similar to Dark Souls; the company wanted Elden Ring to act as an evolution of the self-titled debut of the series. Miyazaki admired the work of Martin, whose contributions he hoped would produce a more accessible narrative than those of the company's earlier games.","Jaccard Noise_40":1.0,"Cosine Noise_40":0.9999999404,"EM Noise_40":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":1,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"February 25, 2022,","Noise_60 Document Index":"3","Noise_60 Document":"Feb 13, 2022 ...

The most common answer was not an already announced game or theoretical sequel, but actually DLC for an existing game, namely this year\u2019s GOTY frontrunner, Elden Ring. And doing the math, announcing DLC for Elden Ring at the Game Awards, a show where it seems somewhat likely to win Game of the Year, actually may add up quite perfectly. With Elden Ring debuting in late February 2022, early December would be just over nine months after the release of the game. Elden Ring is already on the late side when it comes to debuting DLC compared to previous FromSoftware games, as I\u2019ve documented in the past:   So, by this time, Dark Souls 2 and 3 and Bloodborne all had DLC out. In terms of just announcement of DLC, we are way past due. Bloodborne\u2019s Old Hunters DLC was announced six months after release, two months before it came out. Dark Souls 2\u2019s DLC was announced only three months after the game launched. Elden Ring What\u2019s taking so long?

The project was announced in October 2020, with Bullock joining as producer and star and Tatum joining that December; the rest of the cast was announced the following year. Filming took place in the Dominican Republic from May to August 2021. The film premiered at South by Southwest on March 12, 2022, and was theatrically released by Paramount Pictures in the United States on March 25, 2022. It received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed over $190\u00a0million worldwide against a $68\u00a0million budget.

No, really. The roles are perfect. In The Lost City, Sandra Bullock plays Loretta Sage, a widowed romance novelist whose popular series about searching for a very well-researched lost city stars a fictional superhunk named Dash. Alan (Channing Tatum) is the model who portrays Dash \u2014 complete with a flowing blonde wig and frilly shirt \u2014 on all of Loretta's novels, and what he lacks in brains (most of them) he makes up for with sweet sincerity and a desire for Loretta to see him as more than a pretty face.

Da'Vine Joy Randolph plays Beth, Loretta's publisher, although she is also well-known for her roles in films such as Dolemite Is My Name, Trolls World Tour and The Guilty, as well as the TV shows High Fidelity and Only Murders in the Building. But in addition to spending over 10 years working in the industry as an actress, Randolph excels in a different discipline: singing. She originally enrolled at Temple University to improve her singing skills, but eventually switched to musical theater. Once she finished her studies, she enrolled at the Yale School of Drama, graduating in 2011. Randolph has showcased her singing talent in a number of productions, mostly plays. She was even nominated for a Tony Award for her performance in the 2012 Broadway production of Ghost: The Musical.

This became evident in Fight Club, David Fincher's 1999 film in which he co-stars alongside Edward Norton and Helena Bonham Carter. In this production, Pitt plays soap salesman and street fighter Tyler Durden, and for this role, he made quite an extreme decision: he visited the dentist to have his teeth chipped (via Entertainment Weekly). After filming was over, Pitt went back to the dentist to have his teeth fixed as if nothing had happened. His minor role in The Lost City as Jack Trainer was highly acclaimed and absolutely stole the spotlight. In The Lost City, Bowen Yang has a small role as Ray, the moderator of Loretta Sage's press conference. In recent years, Yang gained notoriety for his appearances on Saturday Night Live, Girls5Eva and the rom-coms Fire Island and Bros. However, a little-known fact about this actor and writer is that his career could have gone in a completely different direction: when he was younger, Bowen enrolled at New York University to study chemistry, intending to become a doctor inspired by his favorite fictional character: Cristina Yang from Grey's Anatomy. But as years went by, he came to realize that he was influenced not by Cristina, but by Sandra Oh, the actress who portrayed her, and eventually discovered that acting was his true passion.","Jaccard Noise_80":0.0,"Cosine Noise_80":0.2220483869,"EM Noise_80":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":0,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"Brad Pitt","Noise_100 Document Index":"6","Noise_100 Document":"Mar 22, 2022 ...

Smith returned to his seat and shouted profanity at Rock, who briefly responded, but completed his presentation without further interruption.

Apple announced the M2 on June 6, 2022, at WWDC, along with models of the MacBook Air and the 13-inch MacBook Pro using the M2. The M2 is made with TSMC's \"Enhanced 5-nanometer technology\" N5P process and contains 20 billion transistors, a 25% increase from the M1. Apple claims CPU improvements up to 18% and GPU improvements up to 35% compared to the M1.[3]  The M2 was followed by the professional-focused M2 Pro and M2 Max chips in January 2023. The M2 Max is a higher-powered version of the M2 Pro, with more GPU cores and memory bandwidth, and a larger die size.[4] Apple introduced the M2 Ultra in June 2023, combining two M2 Max chips in one package.[1]","Jaccard Noise_0":0.6666666667,"Cosine Noise_0":0.8112046719,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Summer 2022.","Noise_20 Document Index":"4","Noise_20 Document":"Trusted Reviews is supported by its audience.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk completed the deal to acquire Twitter at his original offer price of $54.20 a share at a total cost of roughly $44 billion. In the ensuing days, Musk fired top executives, laid off half of the company's staff, formed a content moderation council that will review account reinstatements and revamped the platform's subscription service. The changes at Twitter mark the latest chapter in a monthslong saga that began in January when Musk started investing in the social media company. Musk reached an acquisition deal with Twitter in April, but over the ensuing weeks, he raised concerns over spam accounts on the platform, claiming Twitter had not provided him with an accurate estimate of their number.

Musk's $33.5 billion equity commitment included his 9.6% Twitter stake, which is worth $4 billion, and the $7.1 billion he had secured from equity investors, including Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) co-founder Larry Ellison and Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal.","Jaccard Noise_40":1.0,"Cosine Noise_40":0.9033486843,"EM Noise_40":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":1,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"$44 billion.","Noise_60 Document Index":"3","Noise_60 Document":"By\u00a0         Wailin Wong       ,\u00a0         Darian Woods       ,\u00a0        Nicky Ouellet         ,\u00a0         Kate Concannon       Yes, Elon Musk is the richest person in the world.

The tournament consisted of events for professional players in singles, doubles and mixed doubles. Junior and wheelchair players competed in singles and doubles tournaments. As in previous years, the tournament's main sponsor was Kia.  The men's singles title was won by Rafael Nadal, and was Nadal's 21st major title, and his second Australian Open. He defeated second seed Daniil Medvedev in the final, winning in five sets after being two sets down. In winning the title, Nadal broke the record for all-time men's major singles title - it was previously tied at 20 between himself, Novak Djokovic, and Roger Federer. The women's singles title was won by Ashleigh Barty, who won her first Australian Open title and third major title. She defeated 27th seed Danielle Collins in straight sets. Barty was the first Australian to win the title since Chris O'Neil won the title in 1978. The final would also prove to be Barty's last professional match, with Barty announcing her retirement in March 2022.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.9854471684,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Ashleigh Barty","Noise_20 Document Index":"7","Noise_20 Document":"She has won so many 6-0 sets this year \u2014 a \u201cbagel\u201d in tennis parlance \u2014 that the saying \u201cIga\u2019s bakery\u201d was coined.

In her departure, Barty, then the reigning Wimbledon and Australian Open champion, left a significant void in women\u2019s tennis, which has largely been a free-for-all in recent years.

Caroline Garcia, Felix Auger-Aliassime and Holger Rune combined for seven individual titles from August through the end of the season. No woman was more dominant on the hard court during the latter part of 2022 than Garcia, who won the title in Cincinnati, notched the first major semifinal appearance of her career at the US Open and concluded the year with a WTA Finals trophy -- and a matching cowboy hat. Auger-Aliassime, 22, notched three consecutive titles in October, and helped lead Canada to its first Davis Cup victory and Team World to a Laver Cup title. During that dominant stretch, he defeated Djokovic, Nadal and Alcaraz and made it clear he could beat just about anyone. But the man who stopped Auger-Aliassime's win streak? That would be 19-year-old Rune. After losing to the Canadian at the Swiss Indoors final, Rune got his revenge at the semifinals of the Paris Masters the very next week.

All of this puts STX Entertainment in a position to remain independent, now completely separated from Eros International, which we\u2019ve heard has had its own financial baggage, further complicating affairs for the Burbank studio. All of this is good for the greater independent film ecosphere as STX won\u2019t be a theatrical distributor to bite the dust in an industry still obsessed with streaming as the pandemic eases.              \t \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t \t              \tCorporate Affairs \t    \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tSTX Trims Theatrical Distribution & Marketing In Pivot Toward More Hybrid & Streaming Releases\t\t \t\t\t                \tBreaking News \t    \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tAfter STX's Restructure, Where Do High-Profile Guy Ritchie, Michael Mann & Daisy Ridley Movies End Up?","Jaccard Noise_20":1.0,"Cosine Noise_20":0.9696516991,"EM Noise_20":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":1,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"The Najafi Companies","Noise_40 Document Index":"4","Noise_40 Document":"By Jeremy Kay2022-04-22T10:09:00+01:00  Source: STXfilms \u2018The Mauritanian\u2019 Following months of speculation The Najafi Companies has closed its acquisition of STX Entertainment.

After polls closed across France at 8 p.m. local time (2 p.m. ET), the polling companies Opinionway, Harris and IFOP worked with media organizations to publish projected results based on early voting patterns. The interior ministry announced the final results Monday, with Macron winning 58.5 percent of the vote to Le Pen's 41.5 percent. The campaign was beset by apathy, with many voters dissatisfied with both candidates and the turnout looking likely to be around 2 points lower than it was five years ago.

The 13 Pro uses a 12-megapixel sensor. Using a technique called pixel binning, the iPhone 14 Pro joins four pixels together into groups to capture 12-megapixel photos with more detail. You can also take a full 48-megapixel image if you shoot in Apple's ProRaw format, and that gives photographers more flexibility when it comes to editing and recovering shadow and highlight detail among many other advantages. In good lighting, the 12-megapixel shots from both the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro look similar at reduced magnification, and it might not be that easy to spot the difference. It's when you push in a bit that the advantages of the 14 Pro's new sensor and image processing become clear. In the images below that I captured in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park, the tree trunks are more defined and sharper on the iPhone 14 Pro's photo than those on the 13 Pro. Areas of fine detail, like grass, also retain much more resolution. You can click through to the full resolution image from the iPhone 14 Pro and the iPhone 13 Pro to compare more easily.","Jaccard Noise_40":0.0,"Cosine Noise_40":0.5085496306,"EM Noise_40":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":0,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"12","Noise_60 Document Index":"3","Noise_60 Document":"Apple did not go into great detail about the camera hardware changes here, but thankfully Techinsights took the entire camera package apart. The new sensor, at 40mm\u00b2, is almost 50% larger than the iPhone 13 Pro\u2019s 26.9 mm\u00b2 sensor. While its aperture is slightly \u2018slower\u2019 (that is, smaller) the larger sensor compensates. How does the sensor and lens change stack up in practice? The iPhone 14 Pro easily outperforms the previous iPhone, creating far sharper shots: In multiple shots in various conditions, the shots were far more detailed and exhibited less visible processing than comparable iPhone 13 Pro shots: A nice side benefit of a larger sensor is a bit more shallow depth of field. At a 13mm full-frame equivalent, you really can\u2019t expect too much subject separation, but this shot shows some nice blurry figures in the background.  I believe that both Apple\u2019s new Photonic Engine and the larger sensor are contributing to a lot more detail in the frame, which makes a cropped image like the above shot possible. The \u2018my point of view\u2019 perspective that the ultra-wide provides puts you in the action, and a lack of detail makes every shot less immersive.  Is it all perfect? Well, comparably, with the main camera getting ever-better, it is still fairly soft and lacking detail.

To do so, however, you need tools\u2014some of which are proprietary. With the \u201cSelf Service Repair Store\u201d opening today, you can now purchase those parts individually. However, doing so might not be the most cost-effective method. Spending $85 on a Torque Driver or $13 on a single Torx Security Bit adds significant cost to your repair, and you might only need these tools once or twice. Fortunately, Apple offers a $49 (including shipping) rental kit that contains all the tools and parts needed to make repairs on specific devices. Maybe too many parts, depending on which repair you\u2019re making, but there\u2019s no way to rent individual tools a la carte. The rental lasts for 7 days once you\u2019ve received the tool kit, after which you are charged \u201ca fee and a tax\u201d via a hold on your credit card.

Luckily, most of the Tour\u2019s GC contenders managed to avoid losing time, with the exception of Colombia\u2019s Rigoberto Uran (EF Education-EasyPost), who was held up by a crash for the second day in row and this time was unable to rejoin the leaders. The 35-year-old lost 39 seconds by the finish, a tough blow to his chances of scoring a high finish in Paris. Who\u2019s Winning the Tour? Belgium\u2019s Wout van Aert (Jumbo-Visma) is the new overall leader of the 2022 Tour de France.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.1916795373,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

Jackson made news last week by refusing to co-star with 50 Cent in a movie based on the rapper's life. He not only refused, but did it publicly, even though the film is to be directed by six-time Oscar nominee Jim Sheridan (\"In America\"). A clue to Jackson's thinking may be found in his new film, \"Coach Carter,\" based on the true story of a California high school basketball coach who placed grades ahead of sports. Like Bill Cosby, Jackson is arguing against the anti-intellectual message that success for young black males is better sought in the worlds of rap and sports than in the classroom. There is however another aspect to Jackson's refusal: He said he thought Sheridan wanted him to \"lend legitimacy\" to 50 Cent's acting debut. He might have something there. Jackson has an authority on the screen; he occupies a character with compelling force, commanding attention and can bring class to a movie. He might, he said, be interested in working with 50 Cent after the rapper makes another five movies or so, and earns his chops. This reasoning may not be fair. Consider the work that Ice Cube did in \"Boyz N the Hood\" (1991), his first movie and the beginning of a successful acting career. Or look at the promise that Tupac Shakur showed, especially in his last feature, \"Gridlock'd\" (1997), holding his own with the veteran Tim Roth.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.1280777603,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

Choosing a thumbs-down lets you explain why you disliked the message \u2014 whether it was off-topic, nonsensical, rude, spam-like or something else. You can also submit feedback in the chat itself.  To improve BlenderBot 3\u2019s ability to engage with people, we trained it with a large amount of publicly available language data. Many of the datasets used were collected by our own team, including one new dataset consisting of more than 20,000 conversations with people predicated on more than 1,000 topics of conversation. We trained BlenderBot 3 to learn from conversations to improve upon the skills people find most important \u2014 from talking about healthy recipes to finding child-friendly amenities in the city. When the chatbot\u2019s response is unsatisfactory, we collect feedback on it. Using this data, we can improve the model so that it doesn\u2019t repeat its mistakes. We understand that not everyone who uses chatbots has good intentions, so we also developed new learning algorithms to distinguish between helpful responses and harmful examples. Over time, we will use this technique to make our models more responsible and safe for all users. Compared with its predecessors, we found that BlenderBot 3 improved by 31% on conversational tasks. It\u2019s also twice as knowledgeable, while being factually incorrect 47% less often.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.1707919389,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

You can either download the PowerShell script from the Github site or follow these commands to determine what might be blocking Windows 11 22H@ from showing up on your hardware..

The Irish DPC acts as the EU's regulator for several US tech giants including Meta because their headquarters are based in the country. The DPC fine was given to Instagram for failing to protect children's privacy on its platform. The fine was partly based on the fact Instagram had allowed children to operate business accounts on its platform. Instagram business accounts show the account holder's phone number and email address, meaning that data was exposed. The DPC also found the accounts of 13 to 17 year-olds were set to \"public\" as their default setting. A DPC spokesperson told Insider full details of the ruling will be published next week.

The penalty, imposed by Ireland\u2019s Data Protection Commission, brings the fines that the regulator has imposed on Meta since last year to more than $900 million. In September, the same regulator fined the company roughly $400 million for its mistreatment of children\u2019s data. In October last year, Irish authorities fined Meta, which was previously called Facebook, 225 million euros, or about $235 million, for violations related to its messaging service WhatsApp. The accumulating penalties will be a welcome sign to privacy groups that want to see European Union regulators more aggressively enforce the General Data Protection Regulation. The law was hailed as a landmark moment in the regulation of technology companies when it took effect in 2018, but regulators have since faced criticism for not applying the rules strongly enough. Ireland has been under pressure because of the key role it plays in enforcing E.U. data protection rules.

The mega-deal was all about strengthening Google's capabilities in detecting cyber threats \u2013 something Mandiant has become well-known for, said Google Cloud Chief Information Security Officer Phil Venables at a press conference yesterday. \u201cI want to emphasize that this is adding more frontline threat intelligence,\u201d Venables said. \u201cWhen you look at what we\u2019ve got existing at Google, which includes very complementary things from VirusTotal and our other threat intelligence capabilities, bringing that together really gives us this kind of end-to-end security operations stack. Again, Google Cloud is already strong when we think about how we analyze data and put it in context, and that only gets stronger with Mandiant.\u201d Venables was very clear that Google Cloud's ambitions in cybersecurity are massive, but on some level, the size of the deal already said it all. The acquisition is Google's second-largest ever, surpassed only by the company's $12.5 billion buyout of Motorola ten years ago. The more than $5 billion the company spent on Mandiant overshadows even what Google shelled out for Fitbit, which it bought for $2.1 billion.

So we can\u2019t ignore the significance of cloud cybersecurity moving forward as we continue to go completely digital in so many aspects of our lives. Cybersecurity companies are fighting for market share as data breaches and ransomware attacks become more common, more damaging and more expensive. With many companies turning towards cloud technology, it\u2019s no secret that companies like Google, Amazon and Microsoft are going to increase focus on this business sector. That said, Google\u2019s recent acquisition of the cyber security company, Mandiant, has stirred up a lot of conversation about the future of cloud cybersecurity and the highly competitive landscape therein. We\u2019re going to look at this space to see how much money the big players are making. It was announced on September 12 that Google\u2019s $5.4 billion bid to acquire the cybersecurity firm Mandiant was completed. Mandiant will be joining Google\u2019s cloud computing division so Google can attempt to compete with Amazon\u2019s AWS and Microsoft\u2019s Azure. This is Google\u2019s second-largest acquisition as the company aims to focus on enhancing its security operations suite and advisory services.

We've included some key Tears of the Kingdom trailers throughout this article but you can find all of the Tears of the Kingdom trailers that have been released to date on Nintendo's official YouTube channel. In terms of plot, little was revealed prior to the release of Tears of the Kingdom. It's a direct sequel to Breath of the Wild where Link and Zelda seem to be traveling together to investigate a mysterious blight. From the latest trailer, it's clear that something goes wrong during this investigation, Ganon is resurrected, and Link must save the day. Back in 2019, Zelda series producer Eiji Aonuma revealed that the game is going to have a darker tone than Breath of the Wild, and will even be \"a little bit darker\" than Majora's Mask (via IGN). Trailers certainly support this, with what looks like Ganondorf's corpse being resurrected by a disembodied hand, and seemingly imagery from 2006's Twilight Princess, which saw Hyrule turned into a bleak shadow realm \u2013 largely in response to the far cheerier and cartoonish The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.98883605,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.","Noise_20 Document Index":"1","Noise_20 Document":"By  Jay Peters, a news editor who writes about technology, video games, and virtual worlds.

Breath of the Wild is considered one of the greatest video games of all time. Journalists described it as a landmark in open-world design for its emphasis on experimentation, physics-based sandbox, and emergent gameplay. Numerous developers cited Breath of the Wild as inspiration, and it is a popular point of comparison among open-world games. A spin-off, Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity, was released in 2020 while a sequel, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, was released in 2023.  Breath of the Wild is an open world action-adventure game. Players are tasked with exploring the kingdom of Hyrule while controlling Link. Breath of the Wild encourages nonlinear gameplay, which is illustrated by the game's lack of defined entrances or exits to areas,[1] scant instruction given to the player, and encouragement to explore freely.[2] Breath of the Wild introduces a consistent physics engine to the Zelda series, letting players approach problems in different ways rather than trying to find a single solution.[3] The game also integrates a \"chemistry engine\" that defines the physical properties of most objects and governs how they interact with the player and one another.","Jaccard Noise_40":1.0,"Cosine Noise_40":0.9944314957,"EM Noise_40":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":1,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"Tears of the Kingdom","Noise_60 Document Index":"3","Noise_60 Document":"When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.

So with the sequel on its way (albeit later than we anticipated due to a recently revealed delay), many people are referring to it as Breath of the Wild 2.\u00a0 However, an insider has now claimed that it won't be called that at all, and instead will be named Legend of Zelda: Breath of Duality. Nintendo Life journalist, Paul Gale, shared a blogpost on his own website, claiming that a source close to Nintendo informed him of the name. Apparently, the company wants to capitalise on the fact that the name 'Breath of the Wild' is synonymous with 'amazing game', but they also want to hit home that you can play as more than just Link.\u00a0 In the post, Gale continued that there was another benefit to the word 'duality', saying: \"...duality between character abilities, on land and floating regions, past and present, darkness and light, etc.\" Sadly, as is the case with these things sometimes, the insider apparently \"did note that this name was seen a considerable amount of time ago and could have been one of many template titles.\" So by now, the name could've changed.

{"Query":"Who is Italy's first female prime minister?","Correct Answer":["Giorgia Meloni"],"Noise_0 Predicted Answer":"Giorgia Meloni,","Noise_0 Document Index":"3","Noise_0 Document":"There are about 5 million foreign-born residents in Italy.  Giorgia Meloni, leader of Fratelli d'Italia (Brothers of Italy), will become the first female prime minister in Italy\u2019s history. Her election last month will move the country to the far right for the first time since Benito Mussolini\u2019s fall during World War II. The Brothers of Italy, which was founded by Meloni, is a national-conservative populist party that opposes undocumented immigration, according to its website. Meloni\u2019s victory now means uncertainty for those who migrated to Italy. When Baryali Waiz, a refugee in Italy, heard the results of the general election, he said he was worried. \u201cWhat happens when voters can\u2019t find work? They blame migrants,\u201d Waiz told ABC News. As of August, Italy\u2019s unemployment rate stood at 8.1%, the third highest in the European Union after Spain and Greece. Clamping down on immigration was a key part of Meloni\u2019s campaign. Though she softened her rhetoric before the election, Meloni pledged stricter border controls and proposed establishing European Union-managed centers to analyze asylum applications. There are about 5 million foreign-born residents in Italy, making up less than 9% of the country\u2019s total population of 59.2 million, according to the country\u2019s most recent census data.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.9930071235,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Giorgia Meloni","Noise_20 Document Index":"3","Noise_20 Document":"Oct 22, 2022 ...

Here\u2019s how it works Home \/ Features \/ Google Pixel Watch 2: the features we want from a smartwatch successor  The first Pixel Watch was a solid start - but there's room for improvement Android fans had a lot to like about the Google Pixel Watch when it landed in October 2022: a minimal design, slick Fitbit integration, and the best version of the firm\u2019s Wear OS software to date. Google\u2019s first wearable effort wasn\u2019t perfect, though. Battery life was a real downer, and the \u201cone size fits all\u201d approach was off-kilter with the rest of the smartwatch world. That leaves plenty of areas for a Pixel Watch 2 to improve upon. At the time of writing there\u2019s still a fairly long wait before a successor is set to turn up \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t look to the future, or come up with a laundry list of things we\u2019d like to see make the cut by the time it does. Google hasn\u2019t said anything official about a second Pixel Watch. At the annual I\/O event in May 2023, it quickly breezed over WearOS to leave more time to focus on AI, coding and other upcoming hardware like the Pixel Fold smartphone.

Aside from being the company behind many web services, Google has done quite well with its Pixel smartphones \u2014 with the latest being the Google Pixel 7 family. In 2022, Google also released its first smartwatch, the Google Pixel Watch, though it received mixed reviews overall. We\u2019re expecting Google to release a follow-up to the Pixel Watch sometime this year in the form of the Pixel Watch 2 and, hopefully, it will improve upon what was already established with the original. Though there haven\u2019t been a lot of leaked reports about the Pixel Watch 2, here\u2019s what we know so far about the upcoming smartwatch. The Google Pixel Watch launched with a unique aesthetic that was both modern and minimalistic. With that in mind, we should expect the Google Pixel Watch 2 to have the same kind of design, with a domed display, rotating digital crown, and unobtrusive band mechanisms. However, if Google could improve anything with the design here, it should start with thinner bezels on the round display. Durability should be around the same as the first Pixel Watch, and it\u2019s expected to run a version of Wear OS, possibly Wear OS 4. This would mean a clean, Google-focused user experience with customizable tiles, Fitbit integration, and third-party app support.

It was televised nationally in the U.S. by Fox, Fox Deportes, and the Fox Sports and NFL apps, and was the first Super Bowl halftime show to be sponsored by Apple Music.[1][2] It is currently the most-watched Super Bowl halftime show of all time, reaching over 121 million concurrent viewers.   In October 2019, Barbadian singer Rihanna revealed to Vogue that she had turned down an offer from the National Football League (NFL) to perform at the Super Bowl LIII halftime show in solidarity with Colin Kaepernick. In 2016, Kaepernick knelt during the national anthem at the start of NFL games in protest of police brutality and racial inequality in the United States. He later filed a grievance against the NFL and its owners in November 2017, accusing them of colluding to keep him out of the league. Kaepernick withdrew the grievance in February 2019, ahead of Super Bowl LIII, after reaching a confidential settlement with the NFL.[3]","Jaccard Noise_20":1.0,"Cosine Noise_20":0.9999998808,"EM Noise_20":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":1,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"Rihanna","Noise_40 Document Index":"6","Noise_40 Document":"Must be NFL on the brain: Pop icon and entrepreneur Rihanna will perform at next year\u2019s Super Bowl LVII Halftime Show, the NFL announced Sunday.

This House of the Dragon review contains spoilers. \u201cThe Princess and the Queen\u201d is effectively a second pilot episode for House of the Dragon. The installment flashes further forward into the future than ever before and ages its characters up so severely that they may as well be entirely different people. And that\u2019s not even to mention the nearly dozen actually new characters that the episode does introduce in the form of Queen Alicent, Princess Rhaenyra, and Prince Daemon\u2019s respective broods of children.\u00a0 The decision to jump so far down the timeline midseason is as bold a one as you\u2019re likely to see on television. It has every reason to be a disastrous one as well. Shuffling the board to this extent halfway through a story shouldn\u2019t work. And yet, work \u201cThe Princess and The Queen\u201d does.

House of the Dragon\u00a0will feature a large time jump between Episodes 5 and 6; when the dust settles, a bunch of major characters will be played by different actors, and the realm will be a very different place. The floodgates are beginning to open and we are finding out more and more about the last five episodes of season 1. HBO now has Episodes 6-10 listed on their official schedule, complete with runtimes. In addition,\u00a0Rotten Tomatoes\u2018\u00a0series page for the show has episode titles listed. We\u2019re going to lay it all out below, with the slight caveat that since the\u00a0Rotten Tomatoes\u00a0episode titles have not been officially confirmed by HBO, they must be taken with a grain of salt.

While the episode titles aren\u2019t confirmed by HBO, it\u2019s still enough to get us pretty excited. \u201cThe Lord of the Tides\u201d refers to the head of House Velaryon; why will that be so relevant during the longest episode of the season?

Well, I actually think that this this market downturn, while rough for the economy, and rough for others, is coming along at a great time for us because we just became a private company again for the first time in over 25 years. That really gives you the air cover to treat the products right, to make changes the way I\u2019ve done, but then also, to go back to the beginning. I really think top to bottom, every one of these products can be modernized and improved. That includes little things like the freshness of the news feed. I just came out of a three-hour meeting about that last week in our headquarters with with Tapan Bhat whose the new president of Yahoo Finance.

It was released worldwide on November 9, 2022, for both the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5, marking the first cross-gen release in the God of War series. It is the ninth installment in the series, the ninth chronologically, and the sequel to 2018's God of War. Loosely based on Norse mythology, the game is set in ancient Scandinavia and features series protagonist, Kratos, and his now teenage son, Atreus. Concluding the Norse era of the series, the game covers Ragnar\u00f6k, the eschatological event which is central to Norse mythology and was foretold to happen in the previous game after Kratos killed the Aesir god Baldur.  The gameplay is similar to the previous 2018 installment. It features combo-based combat, as well as puzzle and role-playing elements. The gameplay has been revamped from the previous game: in addition to Kratos' main weapons, a magical battle axe and his double-chained blades, he also acquires a magical spear and his shield has become more versatile, with different types of shields that have differing offensive and defensive abilities. His son Atreus, as well as some other characters, provide assistance in combat and can be passively controlled.","Jaccard Noise_20":0.6666666667,"Cosine Noise_20":0.7569320798,"EM Noise_20":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":1,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"2022.","Noise_40 Document Index":"2","Noise_40 Document":"\/VvHuaCKgGn \u2014 Santa Monica Studio \u2013 God of War Ragnar\u00f6k (@SonySantaMonica) September 16, 2020  God of War Ragnarok is set to launch on November 9, 2022.

How is this comparable to other Connected TV subscriptions? While the amount of ad time per hour for Netflix is comparable to other streaming services, the lingering issue is\u00a0when an ad will show. Ad timings are unpredictable, which interrupts the user experience. The video content for ads is about what you expect compared to other streaming services. But the same issue is at hand \u2013 when will this show up in a user\u2019s watching experience on Netflix? According to Jay Peters from\u00a0 The Verge, a user\u2019s ad experience varies dramatically between types of content consumed: As you can see from this example, the amount of ads, as well as the placement of ads, is inconsistent, which leads to believe that Netflix is testing to find the best engagement for not only users but advertisers.

At launch, ads will be 15 to 30 seconds in length.

Democrats were defending their narrow majorities in both chambers and retained control of the Senate, though control of the House isn't yet clear.

The Cook Political Report with Amy Walter rated 36 races as toss-ups. A shift in five seats was the determining factor as to whether the chamber would go to Republicans. Midterm elections historically hurt the president\u2019s party. In 18 of the last 20 elections the president\u2019s party lost ground in the House. Redistricting played a significant role in the 2022 House elections. New lines altered the competitiveness in numerous districts, and some incumbents ran for re-election in the new territory. After the 2020 Census, state legislatures or commissions drew congressional district lines. Both parties filed lawsuits to challenge these new maps. Republicans controlled line-drawing in far more districts than Democrats and, as a result, gained more seats in the House from redistricting alone. Midterms are generally viewed as a referendum on the president. With low approval ratings and high inflation, the Biden administration\u2019s politics, policies, and polling shaped the national atmosphere.

Some might point to poor results in the last 12 years, but who is to say that increased participation would not have led to increased competition and improvement?  The prize money for simply participating in the World Cup could have been injected into grassroots football around the continent, significantly improving the quality of play. Nearly a century after the inaugural World Cup was hosted in Uruguay, Africa will finally be awarded a more equitable number of places, when we will have 9.5 places in 2026 - inching us a bit closer to global parity. The 2022 World Cup has also shown us that a lack of representation, not only in the form of qualification slots, but also in the form of hosting rights, can be extremely influential.  South Korea made the semi-finals in 2002 when they co-hosted the tournament, while the Black Stars of Ghana were a penalty-kick away from the semi-finals in 2010 in Africa's first World Cup in South Africa.  Is it merely a coincidence that Africa and Asia's best ever finishes came the only time the continents have hosted the tournaments? The 2022 World Cup has shown us that the answer is: probably not.

He also did not adhere to the idea that the association\u2019s only path to clarifying its most urgent underlying issues is the passage of new federal laws. Those notions have been articles of faith for Emmert and many other college sports leaders as Emmert\u2019s more-than-12-year run with the NCAA has been drawing to a close. His departure also ends an era in which the association has been led on a permanent basis by either a former college president or former college sports administrator.

On May 10, 2023, he purchased a Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT for 50 ETH on Blur. At the time, the purchase was equal to about $90,000. Why is this so notable? When Alegre made his purchase, the floor price for Bored Ape NFTs was about 44 ETH (around $78,000), according to CoinGecko.  In short, Alegre used his own money to buy an NFT from his own company \u2014 and he bought it for quite a bit more than he needed to. Through his purchase, Alegre likely hoped to demonstrate his belief in the BAYC NFT project and, more broadly, Yuga Labs\u2019 portfolio of intellectual properties. Currently, this portfolio includes nearly all of the most widely known and valuable projects in the NFT space \u2014 Bored Ape Yacht Club, Otherside, Mutant Ape Yacht Club, Bored Ape Kennel Club, CryptoPunks, and Meebits.","Jaccard Noise_60":1.0,"Cosine Noise_60":0.9821492434,"EM Noise_60":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_60":1,"Noise_80 Predicted Answer":"Daniel Alegre.","Noise_80 Document Index":"1","Noise_80 Document":"Apr 1, 2023 ...

The company has also faced criticism for its handling of the situation and the toxic work environment that allegedly exists within the company. This has resulted in significant public backlash, with some fans and employees calling for boycotts and protests. Alegre\u2019s departure from Activision to Yuga Labs may be seen as a positive move for those who are critical of Activision\u2019s leadership and culture. It\u2019s worth noting that the gaming industry and the NFT space have both been the subject of intense scrutiny and controversy in recent years. The allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination at Activision Blizzard have been a particularly significant source of controversy in the gaming industry. Meanwhile, the NFT space has faced criticism for its environmental impact and the high levels of speculation and price volatility surrounding some NFTs. Furthermore, the recent fake news surrounding Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) highlights the need for responsible and informed reporting in the NFT space. Given these issues, the appointment of Alegre as Yuga Labs\u2019 CEO marks an interesting new phase for the company. As Yuga Labs continues to expand its presence in the NFT gaming space, it will be important for the company to navigate these complex issues with transparency and responsibility.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.5,"Cosine Noise_100":0.8304985762,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

If that wasn't exciting enough, these versions come with a new pixel font, which seems to address one of the biggest issues fans had with the games when they first were released - the questionable choice of font by Square Enix for these remasters that left many unhappy. There will also be a new option to switch between the original and new background music whenever you so choose, and there are more options to adjust encounter rate, EXP, Gil, and ABP.

Here\u2019s all the information we know about the Rebel Moon release date. Netflix set the Rebel Moon release date for December 22, 2023. One of the most-anticipated movies in 2023, Rebel Moon was penned by Snyder, Shay Hatten, and Kurt Johnstad. Snyder has directed many movies that can be labeled as sci-fi, proof is his long commitment to the DC Universe superheroes in what was nicknamed the \u201cSnyderverse.\u201d However, Space Moon will be his first space opera. The 57-year-old director started his partnership with Netflix with 2021\u2019s Army of the Dead, a zombie movie that featured an epic heist.  Inspired by Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa and Star Wars, Rebel Moon follows a peaceful colony dealing with an oppressive regent. Still, many details are under wrap, and the movie hasn\u2019t even got a trailer. Yet, Netflix believes so very much in the Rebel Moon potential of the film that a sequel is being filmed back-to-back.

On Monday, Twitch gave the channel a 14-day ban after language model tools from OpenAI went haywire and generated transphobic content that violated community guidelines. Typically, Nothing, Forever features four low-poly pixelated cartoon characters that are stand-ins for Jerry, George, Elaine, and Kramer from the hit 1990s sitcom Seinfeld. They sit around a New York apartment and talk about life, and sometimes the topics of conversation unexpectedly get deep, such as in this viewer-captured segment where they discussed the afterlife. Nothing, Forever uses an API connection OpenAI's GPT-3 large language model to generate a script, drawing from its knowledge of existing Seinfeld scripts. Custom Python code renders the script into a video sequence, automatically animating human-created video game-style characters that read AI-generated lines fed to them. One of its creators provided more technical details on how it works in a Reddit comment from December.

Also at this time, the use of Jerry's stand-up act slowly declined, and the stand-up segment in the middle of Seinfeld episodes was cut.  Much publicity followed the controversial episode, \"The Contest\", an Emmy Award-winning episode written by David, whose subject matter was considered inappropriate for prime time network TV. To circumvent this taboo, the word \"masturbation\" was never used in the script, instead substituted for by a variety of oblique references.[66] Midway through that season, Seinfeld was moved from its original 9:00\u00a0p.m. time slot on Wednesdays to 9:30\u00a0p.m. on Thursdays, following Cheers again, which gave the show even more popularity. Ratings also sparked the move, as Tim Allen's sitcom Home Improvement on ABC had aired at the same time and Improvement kept beating Seinfeld in the ratings. NBC moved the series after Ted Danson announced the end of Cheers and Seinfeld quickly surpassed the ratings of the 9:00\u00a0p.m.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.1664262265,"EM Noise_100":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

REDMOND, Wash. \u2014 Microsoft unveiled a new version of its Bing search engine on Tuesday that incorporates cutting-edge artificial intelligence technology, which company executives hope will help it eventually dethrone Google as the No. 1 search service. Microsoft is teaming up with OpenAI, the San Francisco research lab behind ChatGPT, to revamp Bing so that it can handle more complicated queries alongside providing factual information. \"It's a new day for search,\" said Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella in an announcement made at the company's headquarters on Tuesday. \"In fact, a race starts today in terms of what you can expect.\"  Microsoft's announcement that it is doubling down on what is considered the hottest new technology is a direct challenge to Google, the dominant player in online search for decades. Google controls about 90% of the online search market. Microsoft executive Yusuf Mehdi provided a demonstration of the retooled Bing at a briefing with reporters. The new version is being teased for the public in a \"limited preview,\" with a true public launch coming soon, executives said.","Jaccard Noise_20":0.0,"Cosine Noise_20":0.2609081566,"EM Noise_20":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":0,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"OpenAI technology","Noise_40 Document Index":"1","Noise_40 Document":"\"This is just the first step on the AI front ... as [the] AI arms race takes place among Big Tech,\" he said.  Microsoft, an early backer of San Francisco-based OpenAI, has been investing billions in artificial intelligence. Last month it announced it was extending its collaboration with OpenAI in a \"multiyear, multibillion dollar investment\". It has since announced a new premium tier of Microsoft Teams - its messaging software - that will feature ChatGPT, including a feature that automatically generates notes and highlights of meetings.  Microsoft said Bing will use OpenAI technology that is even more advanced than the ChatGPT technology unveiled last year. The powers will also be incorporated into its Edge web browser.  Analysts say ChatGPT - which has been used by students to pass exams and tests - has the potential to be incredibly disruptive to multiple professions, including journalism.  But it has been criticised for confidently giving answers that are wrong. It also works on datasets that are generally scraped from 2021 or earlier - so many of its answers can feel outdated.","Jaccard Noise_40":0.0,"Cosine Noise_40":0.2978314161,"EM Noise_40":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":0,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"artificial intelligence","Noise_60 Document Index":"3","Noise_60 Document":"It was billed as a landmark event \u2014 Microsoft\u2019s \u201ciPhone moment\u201d \u2014 and lots of Microsoft executives, including the chief executive, Satya Nadella, proudly milled around the conference center, talking to reporters and showing off the company\u2019s new wares.

Microsoft, which first invested in OpenAI in 2019 and re-upped with a reported $10 billion investment this year, is capitalizing on a wave of recent progress in A.I. capabilities to try to catch up with Google, which has long held a dominant position in the search market. (And which has been spooked by all the recent ChatGPT hoopla into releasing new A.I. tools of its own.) Microsoft eventually plans to incorporate OpenAI\u2019s technology into many of its products. But the Bing relaunch is especially momentous for Microsoft, which has struggled to gain a foothold in search for years.

Llamas are used to carry supplies to LeConte Lodge Photo: Getty Images  When you stay at LeConte Lodge in Great Smoky Mountains National Park, you have to work a little bit to get there. Located at 6,360 feet, LeConte Lodge can be reached by guests on foot on six hiking trails. But how does the lodge get its supplies? The answer is llamas. These sure-footed creatures play a key role in getting food and other supplies to the remote lodge.  \u00a0 How does the lodge get its food when there are no roads to the high-altitude perch? A train of llamas has been carrying food, linens and other supplies up the lodge three times a week along the Trillium Gap Trail since 1986.

For the final episode in our Centennial Series covering companies that are 100 years old, I\u2019m talking to Chris Cocks, the CEO of Hasbro. And I have to tell you, I did not know the company was started in 1923 by the Hassenfeld brothers\u2026 the Has bros. This is my favorite fact now.\u00a0 Hasbro is now a big company, and it makes everything from Transformers and Lincoln Logs to My Little Pony and Monopoly. It also makes Magic: The Gathering and Dungeons & Dragons, which are massive and growing businesses. Chris was actually the head of that division, called Wizards of the Coast, before he became the CEO of Hasbro overall last year. Since then, he\u2019s started the process of restructuring the company, which is pure Decoder bait.\u00a0 He\u2019s also dealt with some crises: he\u2019s fended off an activist investor that wanted him to spin off Wizards of the Coast into a new company. The Magic community was upset that too many card sets were being released, including rare collector cards that could suddenly be bought by anybody with enough money. Then, an attempt to change the open gaming license for Dungeons & Dragons led to fan backlash, and Hasbro walked the entire plan back.","Jaccard Noise_40":1.0,"Cosine Noise_40":0.9771112204,"EM Noise_40":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":1,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"Chris Cocks,","Noise_60 Document Index":"4","Noise_60 Document":"Mar 31, 2023 ...

Despite being the world\u2019s second-largest internet market, the majority of smartphones sold in India are priced below $250. While India accounts for a small portion of Apple\u2019s overall revenue, the iPhone-maker has expressed optimism about the nation\u2019s potential for growth. Apple said that the new retail locations \u201cmark a significant expansion in India that will offer great new ways to browse, discover, and buy Apple products with exceptional service and experiences for customers.\u201d In preparation for the store openings, Apple has been actively recruiting employees in recent months, according to growing job postings. The company, which launched its Indian online store in 2020, had initially planned to open its first retail location in 2021, but the COVID-19 pandemic forced a delay. Apple is also working to turn India into a key global hardware manufacturing hub, thanks in part to the incentives New Delhi is offering to manufacturers to expand their presence in the country.","Jaccard Noise_60":1.0,"Cosine Noise_60":1.0,"EM Noise_60":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_60":1,"Noise_80 Predicted Answer":"Mumbai","Noise_80 Document Index":"3","Noise_80 Document":"Two decades after entering India, Apple is gearing up to launch its first set of retail stores in the populous South Asian nation, signaling the tech giant\u2019s growing interest in the market.

But those countries are something India is not: rich. Even the lower- to middle-income countries with Apple stores, such as Brazil, Thailand and Turkey, have per-capita incomes several times higher than India\u2019s.

Furthermore, emotion coping corresponds to one of two general activation systems of affect, that is, the negative activation dimension (Watson and Tellegen, 1985; Watson et al., 1999). High negative activation refers to fear, hostility, guilt, whereas low negative activation includes serenity and calmness (Watson et al., 1999). Negative and positive emotional coping correspond to high and low levels of negative activation, respectively. Moreover, emotion coping can be related to a combination of two dimensions from the circumplex model of affect: valence and arousal (Russell, 1980; Heller, 1990; Yik et al., 2011). Negative emotion coping is linked to negative valence and high arousal, whereas positive emotion coping is conceptually associated with positive valence and low arousal.

I knew I wanted to make a film that was about two sisters, that really foregrounds this sisterly love story, because I don't think we get to see that a lot in films, especially not with action and dance numbers. It was drawn a lot from my own relationship with my sister, such a close, intimate, and loving relationship. But then, when you fight with your siblings, that kind of fighting can be the most brutal.  It's important to me to show a South Asian family [the way I did], because it's sort of been my experience.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":1.0,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Nida Manzoor\u2019s","Noise_20 Document Index":"4","Noise_20 Document":"For more on Universal Pictures, Peacock, and Focus Features projects, check out these stories: Christopher Nolan Reveals Riveting \u201cOppenheimer\u201d Footage at Universal\u2019s CinemaCon Presentation New \u201cFast X\u201d Trailer Finds Jason Momoa\u2019s Dante Taking on the Family \u201cRenfield\u201d Stunt Coordinator Chris Brewster Sinks His Teeth Into Hyperkinetic Action-Comedy Featured image: Priya Kansara stars as Ria Khan in director Nida Manzoor\u2019s POLITE SOCIETY, a Focus Features release.

Peele's use of humor in the 2017 movie also taught Manzoor something very important: \"I didn't realize how much you could use comedy to help keep the audience with you.\" Kill Bill is one of the many films to inspire the action sequences in Polite Society. There is a fight that takes place between Ria and her sister Lena, which is gritty and more grounded than some of the other bigger battle scenes in the movie.

The unemployment rate reached its lowest point since the 1960s. Wages at the low end of the pay scale rose faster than they had in decades.

Certain Medicare and Medicaid waivers and broad flexibilities for health care providers are no longer necessary and will end.

States, hospitals, nursing homes, and others are currently operating under hundreds of these waivers that affect care delivery and payment and that are integrated into patient care and provider systems. Many of these waivers and flexibilities were necessary to expand facility capacity for the health care system and to allow the health care system to weather the heightened strain created by COVID-19; given the current state of COVID-19, this excess capacity is no longer necessary. CMS developed a roadmap for the eventual end of the COVID-19 PHE, which was published in August 2022, and has been sharing information on what health care facilities and providers can do to prepare for future emergencies.

Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.  One of the most impressive demos at Google I\/O started with a photo of a woman in front of a waterfall. A presenter onstage tapped on the woman, picked her up, and moved her to the other side of the image, with the app automatically filling in the space where she once stood. They then tapped on the overcast sky, and it instantly bloomed into a brighter cloudless blue. In just a matter of seconds, the image had been transformed. The AI-powered tool, dubbed the Magic Editor, certainly lived up to its name during the demo. It\u2019s the kind of tool that Google has been building toward for years. It already has a couple of AI-powered image editing features in its arsenal, including the Magic Eraser, which lets you quickly remove people or objects from the background of an image. But this type of tool takes things up a notch by letting you alter the contents \u2014 and potentially, the meaning \u2014 of a photo in much more significant ways. While it\u2019s clear that this tool isn\u2019t flawless\u00a0\u2014 and there remains no firm release date for it \u2014 Google\u2019s end goal is clear: to make perfecting photos as easy as just tapping or dragging something on your screen.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.9917017221,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Magic Editor,","Noise_20 Document Index":"2","Noise_20 Document":"May 10, 2023 ...

Though we only got a sneak peek, the results are impressive and prove that an era of advanced image manipulation for the masses isn\u2019t far off, thanks to AI. Of course, AI-powered image editing is nothing new for Google. Handy tools like the Magic Eraser, for removing unwanted distractions, and Photo Unblur, for enhancing soft\/blurred shots, have been around for several years. And Google has been leveraging AI to help organize and surface images in users\u2019 libraries since 2015. But the Magic Editor takes AI-enhanced manipulation a leap further. Not only can users select and edit subjects (similar to using a mask in Lightroom\/Capture One) but with a few taps of the screen you can easily scale and reposition subjects in the frame. The demo also shows the tool's ability to expand an image\u2019s composition through generative AI. Of course, the results aren\u2019t perfect. In the example with the balloons, for instance, the portion of the bench created using generative AI shows a noticeable red tint. Similarly, in the waterfall demo, the area under the subject\u2019s arm shows an obvious repeating pattern in the rocks. These criticisms aside, the power of this tool to dramatically reshape image editing on the fly can\u2019t be understated.","Jaccard Noise_40":1.0,"Cosine Noise_40":0.9999998808,"EM Noise_40":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":1,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"Imagen Editor.","Noise_60 Document Index":"4","Noise_60 Document":"Jun 12, 2023 ...

Apple Vision Pro is a \"mixed reality\" headset, meaning it can display both virtual and augmented reality content. It is not like augmented reality glasses, however, as it is designed to completely cover the eyes and block out all of your surroundings.   Apple is using exterior and interior cameras for the augmented reality component of the device. The cameras are able to map the space around you and project the real world back to you, so though you're not actually looking at what's around you using see-through glasses, you are effectively seeing an accurate picture of your real world environment.  With this capability, Apple can show you 3D windows, objects, and content in your actual space, or the cameras can be turned off to shut out the world to provide an entirely virtual setting.

At its annual developer conference, Apple also introduced a raft of new products and features, including a 15-inch MacBook Air, a powerful chip called M2 Ultra, improvements to its iOS software and a long-awaited tweak to prevent its autocorrect from annoyingly changing a common expletive to \"ducking\". The Vision Pro will start at $3,499, more than three times the cost of the priciest headset in Meta's line of mixed and virtual reality devices. The headset will test a market crowded with devices that have yet to gain traction with consumers and put it in direct competition with Facebook-owner Meta after years of clashes between the companies over issues like user privacy and control of developer platforms. Apple emphasized the novelty of the headset's augmented reality features as well as the sports and entertainment partnerships it would offer. The device will use a new chip called R1 that will process information from its sensors in less time than the blink of an eye, Apple said. But the announcements failed to excite Wall Street, which had bid up Apple shares to a record high ahead of the launch. The stock was largely flat in post-market trading.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.9999999404,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Apple Vision Pro","Noise_20 Document Index":"5","Noise_20 Document":"Subscribe for regular MacRumors news and future Apple Vision Pro info. Apple Vision Pro is Apple's augmented and virtual reality headset, a device that has been in development for more than a decade. Vision Pro marks the company's first entrance into a new product category since the 2015 Apple Watch, with the device introduced at WWDC 2023 in June. A launch is set for early 2024, which means January to late April. While the Apple Vision Pro is definitely a headset, Apple does not use that word when referring to it. Instead, Apple calls it a spatial computer because of its ability to blend digital content with the physical world.  Apple Vision Pro is a mixed reality headset that displays augmented reality content overlaid on world around you, and immersive entirely virtual content, but it's worth noting that the headset is not see through. Everything you see is digital. For augmented reality content that does not make your surroundings disappear, Apple uses cameras that map out what's in front of you, translating that into a digital image augmented by virtual elements.  For a virtual reality experience, Apple shuts off those cameras and can make it seem like you are completely isolated from what's going on around you, allowing you to focus solely on what's being displayed on the headset's screens. This shift between the \"real\" and the \"immersive\" can be controlled with an on-device Digital Crown.","Jaccard Noise_20":0.6666666667,"Cosine Noise_20":0.7481936812,"EM Noise_20":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":1,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"\"xrOS\",","Noise_40 Document Index":"1","Noise_40 Document":"Dec 3, 2022 ...

He hit his tee shot on the par-3 15th over the green and failed to get up and down, settling for a bogey, then drove into a bunker on the 16th and had to chip back into the fairway.","Jaccard Noise_40":1.0,"Cosine Noise_40":1.0,"EM Noise_40":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":1,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"Scottie Scheffler.","Noise_60 Document Index":"0","Noise_60 Document":"Last week at the RBC Canadian Open, McClure listed Nick Taylor and Tyrrell Hatton as two of his top one and done picks.

One of McClure's top one and done picks this week for the U.S. Open is world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler. As the betting favorite, Scheffler will likely be a popular pick in golf one and done pools, but McClure still sees value in targeting the red-hot 26-year-old. Scheffler has two wins in elevated events in 2023 and his track record at major championships over the last two years is unmatched. Scheffler enters the third major of the PGA Tour season ranked first in total strokes gained (2.544), strokes gained tee-to-green (2.775), strokes gained off-the-tee (1.096), and strokes gained on approach (1.207). He is also sixth in strokes gained around-the-green (0.458), and McClure feels strongly that Scheffler will be in contention entering the weekend.
