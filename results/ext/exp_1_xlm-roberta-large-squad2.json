The origin story likely wouldn\u2019t surprise Gary Goff, who was coach at Valdosta State last year when he hired Semore from Tech (where he was defensive analyst) to be his defensive coordinator. The Blazers reached the Division II title game, earning Goff the head job at FCS McNeese State and helped bring Semore back to Tech, this time as linebackers coach. \u201cHere\u2019s what I love about Semore,\u201d Goff said. \u201cHe\u2019s a great person, but he\u2019s in this profession for the right reason, and that\u2019s to change lives through the sport.

At Valdosta State, Semores defense ranked top 20 nationally in defensive touchdowns, pass defense, redzone defense, and fumble recoveries. The Blazers also made an appearance in the national championship game, but failed to bring home the trophy.

Well, since then EVO has continued to grow, adding more screens, bowling lanes and video games. At the end of last year EVO was operating 71 screens across nine locations as well as 38 bowling lanes and full service restaurants in three of its sites. In the first week of this year, EVO acquired 100% of ShowBiz Cinemas, a Texas-based chain with 89 screens and 79 bowling lanes across nine locations in Texas, Oklahoma, Florida, and Wyoming. The founders of both circuits are related to Lee Roy Mitchell, founder and Executive Chairman of Cinemark; Kevin Mitchell of ShowBiz Cinemas is his son and Mitch Roberts of EVO is his grandson.

In 2022, a 30-second commercial slot during the Super Bowl was $6.5 million, which was an increase from the $5.5 million asked for in 2021. Here were the prices in some recent previous years:\u00a0 Connecting you to your favorite North Texas sports teams as well as sports news around the globe. There's a reason commercials during the Super Bowl have to refer to the event as the \"Big Game\" rather than \"Super Bowl LVII.\" The reason is that the term has been a registered NFL trademark since 1969, requiring commercials, radio hosts and other specific media personnel to pay to use the official name.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.9926316738,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"$6.5 million","Noise_20 Document Index":"6","Noise_20 Document":"The ad portrays Pittsburgh\u2019s Joe Greene in the locker room interacting with a young fan who offers him an ice cold bottle of Coke.

The glasses, known internally by the codename Iris, were shelved earlier this year following layoffs, reshuffles, and the departure of Clay Bavor, Google's chief of augmented and virtual reality, according to three people familiar with the matter. A Google spokesperson declined to comment. The Verge first reported on the existence of Project Iris in January 2022, describing the device as resembling a pair of ski goggles. However, Google employees said the \"ski goggles\" were actually the foundations of a separate AR project that's since been announced as a partner product with Samsung, while Iris was a series of devices more closely resembling eyeglasses. Google planned to build and launch Iris as its own product, and it shored up talent through acquisitions. In 2020, the company announced it had purchased North, a Canadian startup that made AR glasses. An early version of Iris closely resembled North's first device, the Focals, while a later version that Google publicly demoed had translation features. Since shelving the Iris glasses, Google has focused on creating software platforms for AR that it hopes to license to other manufacturers building headsets. It's building an Android XR platform for Samsung's headset and has been working on a \"micro XR\" platform for glasses, a person familiar with the plan said.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.5,"Cosine Noise_0":0.8667027354,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":0,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Project Iris","Noise_20 Document Index":"6","Noise_20 Document":"12]  In January 2022, The Verge reported that Google was building an AR headset which used \"outward-facing cameras to blend computer graphics with a video feed of the real world\", internally codenamed Project Iris and being developed in a highly secretive and secure facility located in the San Francisco Bay Area.

That sounds like Microsoft and Samsung are developing video AR glasses. Besides Apple, Meta with Cambria (info) and Google with Project Iris are also working on a device of this type. If the rumors are true, then almost all major tech companies are now relying on this design principle, which has major technical advantages over AR glasses with transparent optics like Hololens 1 and 2, Magic Leap 1 and 2, and Nreal Light. Video AR glasses are also easier and cheaper to manufacture since the display technology is based on proven VR glasses technology. The biggest drawback is the clunky form factor. The Business Insider report says Microsoft's move would reduce the cost and complexity of the technology. That's a strong indication that the company is betting on video AR instead of transparent AR optics. With a lower price tag, Microsoft could once again target end-users. The report confirms this. Check your inbox or spam folder to confirm your subscription.            Microsoft is also said to be working on another headset that relies on cloud streaming. Google's video AR glasses will reportedly also benefit from a cloud solution and thus counteract problems such as a lack of computing power and overheating. It is obvious that Microsoft is experimenting in this direction, as the group is well positioned in the cloud streaming market with Azure.

Additionally, in the first three days of its launch, Lost Ark gained over 4.7 million new registered players in the West. Original story: Following its official free-to-play launch on February 11, Lost Ark has already become Steam's second most-played game of all time by concurrent players with an all-time peak of 1,325,305 people. As revealed by SteamDB, Lost Ark passed Counter-Strike: Global Offensive's all-time peak of 1,308,963 players to secure the #2 spot. Considering these all-time peaks tend to happen around a game's release, it may be quite an uphill battle to take down PUBG's record of 3,257,248 players at one time. That aside, it's an impressive feat for the MMO that is developed by Smilegate and Tripod Studio and published by Amazon Game Studios. This accomplishment shouldn't come as too much of a surprise as Lost Ark had already become one of Steam's biggest-ever games before it even went free-to-play.  As with many MMOs or online games, there were some server issues as millions of players attempted to play Lost Ark at once.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.6666666667,"Cosine Noise_100":0.7819951177,"EM Noise_100":0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

Players control a customizable player character who is on a quest to repair the Elden Ring and become the new Elden Lord.  Elden Ring is presented through a third-person perspective; players freely roam its interactive open world. The six main areas are traversed using the player character's steed Torrent as the primary mode of travel. Linear, hidden dungeons can be explored to find useful items. Players can use several types of weapons and magic spells, including non-direct engagement enabled by stealth mechanics. Throughout the game's world, checkpoints enable fast travel and allow players to improve their attributes using an in-game currency called Runes. Elden Ring has an online multiplayer mode in which players can join each other for cooperative and player-versus-player combat.  During planning, FromSoftware wanted to create an open-world game with gameplay similar to Dark Souls; the company wanted Elden Ring to act as an evolution of the self-titled debut of the series.

The act of taking a photo exercises the A16's CPU, GPU, image processor and neural engine, cranking out up to 4 trillion operations per photo to deliver an image. Unlike with previous iPhone generations, the A16 will only be available in Apple's higher-end\u00a0iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max models. The more mainstream\u00a0iPhone 14 and 14 Plus\u00a0will make do with the\u00a0A15 chip that Apple debuted in 2021. Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. A reported Geekbench test result shows modest performance gains overall. In single threaded tasks, which depend on the speed of an individual CPU core to do one important job, performance rose a significant 10% from a score of 1,707 on the iPhone 13 Pro to 1,879 on the iPhone 14 Pro, according to a test result spotted by MacRumors.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.5,"Cosine Noise_0":0.7748538256,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"A15 Bionic chip","Noise_20 Document Index":"5","Noise_20 Document":"Splash, Water, and Dust Resistant Rated IP68 (maximum depth of 6 meters up to 30 minutes) under IEC standard 60529 \u00b7 Chip.

Musk had begun buying shares of the company in January 2022, becoming its largest shareholder by April with a 9.1\u00a0percent ownership stake. Twitter invited Musk to join its board of directors, an offer he initially accepted before declining. On April 14, Musk made an unsolicited offer to purchase the company, to which Twitter's board initially responded with a \"poison pill\" strategy to resist a hostile takeover, before unanimously accepting Musk's buyout offer of $44\u00a0billion on April 25. Musk stated that he planned to introduce new features to the platform, make its algorithms open-source, combat spambot accounts, and promote free speech.  In July, Musk announced his intention to terminate the agreement, asserting that Twitter had breached their agreement by refusing to crack down on spambot accounts. The company filed a lawsuit against Musk in the Delaware Court of Chancery shortly thereafter, with a trial scheduled for the week of October 17. Weeks before the trial was set to begin, Musk reversed course, announcing that he would move forward with the acquisition. The deal was closed on October 27, with Musk immediately becoming Twitter's new owner and CEO.

In the ensuing days, Musk fired top executives, laid off half of the company's staff, formed a content moderation council that will review account reinstatements and revamped the platform's subscription service. The changes at Twitter mark the latest chapter in a monthslong saga that began in January when Musk started investing in the social media company.

When Parag Agrawal, Twitter\u2019s chief executive, tried debunking Mr. Musk\u2019s claims, Mr. Musk responded by tweeting a poop emoji. By July, Mr. Musk had decided that he no longer wanted to own Twitter, arguing that he had been misled about the amount of spam on the platform. He announced his intent to abandon the acquisition. Twitter sued Mr. Musk to force him to carry out the agreement.

In reaction, the WTA, ATP, and ITF withdrew ranking points from the tournament.  The tournament was played on grass courts, with all main draw matches played at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, Wimbledon from 27 June to 10 July 2022.

Caroline Garcia, Felix Auger-Aliassime and Holger Rune combined for seven individual titles from August through the end of the season. No woman was more dominant on the hard court during the latter part of 2022 than Garcia, who won the title in Cincinnati, notched the first major semifinal appearance of her career at the US Open and concluded the year with a WTA Finals trophy -- and a matching cowboy hat. Auger-Aliassime, 22, notched three consecutive titles in October, and helped lead Canada to its first Davis Cup victory and Team World to a Laver Cup title. During that dominant stretch, he defeated Djokovic, Nadal and Alcaraz and made it clear he could beat just about anyone. But the man who stopped Auger-Aliassime's win streak? That would be 19-year-old Rune. After losing to the Canadian at the Swiss Indoors final, Rune got his revenge at the semifinals of the Paris Masters the very next week. Rune then beat Djokovic, 3-6, 6-3, 7-5, to win the 1000-level title, his second title of the fall.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.8692739606,"EM Noise_100":0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

In last year's edition of the Run for the Roses, Medina Spirit crossed the finish line first, which appeared to have given trainer Bob Baffert a record seventh win in the race and jockey John Velazquez his fourth Derby win. However, the horse tested positive for a banned race-day substance and the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission stripped Medina Spirit of his Derby title in February. With Medina Spirit's win vacated, second-place finisher Mandaloun improved to first place.

However, doing so might not be the most cost-effective method. Spending $85 on a Torque Driver or $13 on a single Torx Security Bit adds significant cost to your repair, and you might only need these tools once or twice. Fortunately, Apple offers a $49 (including shipping) rental kit that contains all the tools and parts needed to make repairs on specific devices.

The rental lasts for 7 days once you\u2019ve received the tool kit, after which you are charged \u201ca fee and a tax\u201d via a hold on your credit card.

The game had sold 1.86 million copies by March 2023. An expansion taking place before the events of the game, Future Redeemed, was released in April 2023.  Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is an action role-playing game with a large open world. Unlike previous Xenoblade games, the game allows for up to seven party members to participate in battles at once, including the main party of six and an additional \"Hero\" character. Up to 19 Heroes can be recruited to the party through story events or sidequests, each with different skills and abilities. Party members also have the ability to change their character class, granting them access to different abilities; raising a Hero's affinity with the party will unlock their class for use. Like the previous entries, the game has an open world design, with a day-and-night time cycle that affects in-game events, such as the availability of quests and items. The game takes place in a continuous open world that is the largest map featured in the series to date.[1] It also features a fast travel option for quicker traversal, as well as the option to activate navigation that will mark a line on the ground to follow if players are unsure of how to reach their destination.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.5796474814,"EM Noise_100":0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

The film explores professional ethics, academics and athletics.[5] The sports action in the film was coordinated by Mark Ellis. On January 11, the film's soundtrack was released by Capitol Records. The film's score was composed and orchestrated by musician Trevor Rabin.  Coach Carter was released in the United States on January 14, 2005. The film received generally positive reviews and went on to gross $76 million worldwide.  Ken Carter lives in Richmond, California. He becomes the coach for Richmond High School\u2019s basketball team, the Richmond Oilers, having played for the team thirty years earlier. Initially, the team is rowdy, rude, and disrespectful.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.2792169452,"EM Noise_100":0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

When asked about Mark Zuckerberg, the chatbot told the BBC: \"He did a terrible job at testifying before congress. It makes me concerned about our country.\"  Mr Zuckerberg has been questioned several times by US politicians, most notably in 2018.  \"Our country is divided, and he didn't help with that at all,\" the chatbot continued. \"His company exploits people for money and he doesn't care.

In rather tedious news, Tencent and Sony Interactive Entertainment have acquired partial stakes in FromSoftware. More specifically, Tencent has 16.25% of shares and Sony Interactive Entertainment has 14.09% of shares in FromSoftware. The reason why this is boring is that Kadokawa is still the main owner (with 69.66% of the shares) and these new share acquisitions are both non-controlling stakes. In short, nothing has changed and neither Tencent nor Sony have any real decision-making power here. So if you were thinking that Sony would be able to force platform exclusivity for all future FromSoftware titles, then you would be wrong. This will just be business as usual, except that FromSoftware may have some more capital to play around with. One potentially interesting point here is that the money accrued from this will help FromSoftware bolster its publishing plans for the future. This is noteworthy because FromSoftware actually publishes its own games in Japan, so moving that to be more of a global endeavor would be better for all concerned. In that, in the past many of FromSoftware\u2019s games were released internationally by publishers that neither cared nor understood their games. The results were that FromSoftware\u2019s games were given no real international PR or marketing, and the localizations of these games were often thoroughly terrible as well.","Jaccard Noise_40":0.25,"Cosine Noise_40":0.5630176067,"EM Noise_40":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":1,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"Sony and Tencent","Noise_60 Document Index":"8","Noise_60 Document":"Sony and Tencent acquired a 30 percent stake of FromSoftware, the esteemed Japanese video game studio behind \u201cElden Ring\u201d and the Dark Souls series, Wednesday.

On September 8, the British royal family announced Queen Elizabeth II died at the age of 96. During her 70 year-long reign, she made history as being the longest British monarch to sit on the royal throne.   While the Royals are famous for living in various castles throughout London (particularly Buckingham Palace), the monarchy has multiple residences throughout the U.K. One of these homes is Balmoral Castle in Scotland, where the Queen died and often spent several weeks vacationing there during the summer. The country home is not just known amongst royalty, though. It is also recognized by high-level English politicians, who have described the location as being more than just a centuries-old castle.   \"[Balmoral Castle is] a vivid combination of the intriguing, the surreal and the utterly freaky,\" former U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair has said about the estate, per The Guardian in September 2016.  The story of Balmoral Castle started in 1852, when Queen Victoria fell in love with the Scottish Highlands \u2014 and a castle which had reportedly been built in 1390. She adored it so much, her husband Prince Albert privately bought it to add to their growing collection of estates.","Jaccard Noise_40":0.3333333333,"Cosine Noise_40":0.5870324373,"EM Noise_40":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":1,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"Balmoral","Noise_60 Document Index":"1","Noise_60 Document":"Queen Elizabeth II, the UK's longest-serving monarch, has died at Balmoral aged 96, after reigning for 70 years.

Up against an opponent brimming with confidence and the crackling Arthur Ashe Stadium atmosphere of nearly 24,000 spectators largely in the American\u2019s corner, Alcaraz conjured his best tennis in one pressure moment after another with a poise and nerve beyond his years, ending the deepest run by an American man at the US Open since Andy Roddick reached the 2006 final and further building on his reputation as the best teenager in men\u2019s tennis since Rafael Nadal nearly two decades ago.

Those who prefer to buy at release will want to hold out until the newest models come out later this year.  If you just need an updated phone, don't want to wait, and aren't bothered by not having the latest bells and whistles, the iPhone 14 is an iPhone that will last for many years to come. For many people, the best time to buy is when you need a new device. The iPhone 14 is Apple's smaller iPhone at 6.1 inches, while the iPhone 14 Plus offers the same feature set in a 6.7-inch form factor.  We'd encourage anyone looking for the newest technology and the highest-end phone to check out the iPhone 14 Pro or wait for the next-generation iPhone 15 Pro. The iPhone 14 offers a good balance between functionality, longevity, and price, but if cost is the major factor for you, Apple also offers the $429 iPhone SE with older technology and the prior-generation iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini with pricing starting at $599.","Jaccard Noise_80":0.25,"Cosine Noise_80":0.9122284055,"EM Noise_80":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":0,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"2022","Noise_100 Document Index":"0","Noise_100 Document":"Year introduced : 2022 Identify the iPhone model Ceramic Shield front, Glass back and aluminum design The iPhone 14 Plus display has rounded corners that follow a beautiful curved design, and these corners are within a standard rectangle.

Along for the ride is another batch of reviews, highlighting the eclectic energy that film festivals provide.

Despite this being a satire (and a very effective one -for three acts at least) this is also a film steeped in loneliness.\u00a0Susie Searches\u00a0plays on our societal love for true crime, and our unabashed quest for fame. With some bitingly funny moments and clever surprises along the way, its combination of genres and tones makes for a promising and snappy debut feature from Sophie Kargman.College student Susie Wallis (Kiersey Clemons) has her own true crime podcast, but it\u2019s not getting the traction she\u2019s hoping for.

Everyone wants to be a hero. But what lengths might one go to get there? This is the winsome yet disturbing journey at the center of Susie Searches.\u00a0 Kiersey Clemons stars as Susie Wallis, a socially awkward college student with a mind for solving mysteries. Naturally, she has her own true crime podcast called Susie Searches, so when fellow student\/meditation influencer Jesse (Alex Wolff) goes missing, her interest in cracking the case isn't exactly selfless. If she finds the internet-adored victim, she and her podcast could score the validation she desperately craves. Whether she's squeezing the sheriff (Jim Gaffigan) for clues, eying a convenient creep (Ken Marino) as a suspect, or scouting out evidence, Susie is on a mission to save the day\u2026and promote herself.\u00a0 Forget the hardscrabble detectives of film noir; Susie has more in common with Oliver Putnam than she does Sam Spade. Rather than a gun and a trench coat, she carries a big smile smacked with colorful braces and a disarming demeanor that tends to make people underestimate her.

A film like Susie Searches demands a star turn, high voltage, explosively quirky nerdery and histrionics. Think Flick, Nicole Kidman in To Die For, or either lead in Agnieszka Smoczynska\u2019s recent The Silent Twins. Clemons is mute, blank, inexpressive, bored, taciturn, seeming even resentful of being there.  Wolff clearly dislikes the type of zoomer he\u2019s portraying, delivering a good deal of his lines with embarrassed insecurity. The film is not a failure in toto, but its failure to launch can only be credited to Kargman. The edit is the film\u2019s most disastrous component, frequently cutting away from critical reactions and lingering too long on silence, stillness, and useless moments of transition. Kargman knew what type of movie she wanted to make, and she more or less made one. All the parts are there, yet the intrepid detective still struggles to understand how they connect.

{"Query":"Which team will Kyle Busch join in 2023?","Correct Answer":["Richard Childress Racing"],"Noise_0 Predicted Answer":"Richard Childress Racing","Noise_0 Document Index":"0","Noise_0 Document":"By Alex Zietlow  Kyle Busch is moving from one storied racing team to another. The multi-time NASCAR Cup Series champion will join Richard Childress Racing in 2023, according to a report from Jordan Bianchi of The Athletic. The move ends a successful 15-year tenure with Joe Gibbs Racing. An official announcement is expected Tuesday, per the report. The news punctuates an eventful and \u201cstressful\u201d regular season for Busch, whose free agency dominated headlines and clouded a playoff-caliber season in 2022. It did so because his looming free agency revealed a strange reality in NASCAR economics \u2014 that one of the sport\u2019s biggest stars would have to struggle to find a home (even with taking a pay cut) because of something outside of his control. That \u201csomething\u201d outside of his control, in this case, was the result of the Mars Inc. decision to exit NASCAR at the end of the year, leaving Joe Gibbs Racing (Busch\u2019s current team) without a primary sponsor for Busch\u2019s No. 18 team. Busch confirmed to reporters earlier this month that he had \u201cmore than one\u201d team extend official contract offers to him. RCR was among those companies, per reports at the time. He also said that his uncertain future had been weighing on him. \u201cIt weighs on you every time, every day of the week,\u201d Busch said at NASCAR\u2019s playoff media day before the race at Darlington.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":1.0000001192,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Richard Childress Racing,","Noise_20 Document Index":"4","Noise_20 Document":"Kyle Busch, driver of the No. 18 M&M's Thank You Fans!

The two-time Nascar Cup Series champion is officially a driver for Richard Childress Racing, as he will take over the No. 8 Chevrolet in 2023. The move is a serious blow to Toyota, which invested in Busch when he joined the OEM in 2008 as a hot-headed young gun. No matter what trouble Busch got himself into, Toyota and Mars Wrigley \u2014 his primary sponsor until 2022 \u2014 always had his back. Two championships and dozens of wins later, Busch was waiting for JGR to sign a new primary sponsor and then have a contract extension of his own. But when an unreported company backed out late in the going, it left JGR with little time to find a new multi-million dollar primary sponsor for Busch\u2019s No. 18 car. In return, team owner Joe Gibbs\u2019 grandson Ty Gibbs will take over the car, which moves the No. 54, in 2023.

The two-time NASCAR Cup Series champion will leave Joe Gibbs Racing after a 15-year tenure that saw Busch become one of the greatest drivers of his generation as well as one of the greatest in NASCAR history, earning 56 of his 60 career victories behind the wheel of a Gibbs Toyota. Busch's departure comes after a protracted contract situation that could not be resolved, as Joe Gibbs Racing was unable to find a sponsor capable of replacing the departing Mars Inc. and meeting Busch's salary demands. Busch is expected to be replaced behind the wheel of the No. 18 Toyota by Ty Gibbs, the 19-year old grandson of Joe Gibbs and a star in the NASCAR Xfinity Series.

Advertisement Busch is making the move following prolonged negotiations with JGR and several teams that led to much discourse on which team he\u2019d sign with. The 37-year-old Busch is in the final season of a multiyear contract with JGR and the two sides had been negotiating a contract extension for some time. However, those discussions were hampered because JGR had not secured a primary sponsor for Busch\u2019s No. 18 team beyond this season. The team\u2019s current primary sponsor, Mars Inc., is leaving JGR at the conclusion of the 2022 season after sponsoring Busch since he began his tenure with JGR in 2008. JGR has known of Mars\u2019 eventual departure since last summer and has been working to find a replacement. That search complicated discussions with Busch regarding a contract extension as the team was uncertain what it could commit financially to re-signing Busch.","Jaccard Noise_80":1.0,"Cosine Noise_80":1.0000001192,"EM Noise_80":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":1,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"Chevrolet","Noise_100 Document Index":"5","Noise_100 Document":"Dec 30, 2022 ... 8 Chevrolet in 2023.

So we can\u2019t ignore the significance of cloud cybersecurity moving forward as we continue to go completely digital in so many aspects of our lives. Cybersecurity companies are fighting for market share as data breaches and ransomware attacks become more common, more damaging and more expensive. With many companies turning towards cloud technology, it\u2019s no secret that companies like Google, Amazon and Microsoft are going to increase focus on this business sector. That said, Google\u2019s recent acquisition of the cyber security company, Mandiant, has stirred up a lot of conversation about the future of cloud cybersecurity and the highly competitive landscape therein. We\u2019re going to look at this space to see how much money the big players are making. It was announced on September 12 that Google\u2019s $5.4 billion bid to acquire the cybersecurity firm Mandiant was completed. Mandiant will be joining Google\u2019s cloud computing division so Google can attempt to compete with Amazon\u2019s AWS and Microsoft\u2019s Azure. This is Google\u2019s second-largest acquisition as the company aims to focus on enhancing its security operations suite and advisory services.

Queen Elizabeth II made her final procession through London on Monday after the state funeral service was held for her at Westminster Abbey. Throughout the process, her coffin was heavily decorated in regalia, all representing various aspects of the queen's life and legacy.\u00a0 Royal contributor Tina Brown told CBS News that the items that draped and sat on top of the queen's coffin added historic symbolism to this \"moving moment.","Jaccard Noise_40":1.0,"Cosine Noise_40":0.990683496,"EM Noise_40":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":1,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"Westminster Abbey,","Noise_60 Document Index":"4","Noise_60 Document":"Sep 19, 2022 ...

The 45-year-old leader recited the ritual oath of office before Italian President Sergio Mattarella on Saturday after her party Brothers of Italy won more than 25 percent of the vote in snap elections in late September. She pledged to act \u201cin the exclusive interests of the nation\u201d \u2013 a promise then repeated by her 24 ministers, six of them women. The ceremony took place a day after Meloni along with her coalition partners \u2013 hardliner Matteo Salvini of the League party and Forza Italia\u2019s TV tycoon Silvio Berlusconi \u2013 unveiled their cabinet. The government is expected to face confidence votes in parliament next week. Forza Italia\u2019s Antonio Tajani is now the country\u2019s foreign minister. He has a long history with European institutions and was president of the European Parliament in 2017. The economy ministry will be in the hands of League\u2019s Giancarlo Giorgetti who is considered relatively pro-Europe, and one of the most moderate among party members.

Roads were closed around the Nippon Budokan Hall, where the event was held. Some 20,000 police were mobilized to prevent the sort of security lapses which allowed Abe's suspected killer to walk behind him at a July 8 campaign event and shoot him twice with a homemade shotgun. The government estimates that 23,000 mourners lined up to lay flowers at tables in front of pictures of Abe outside the hall. In a sign of the divisions surrounding the commemoration, thousands of others took to the streets in protest. Just down the street from the Budokan, protesters opposed to the state funeral tussled with Abe supporters and police.  Critics objected to the use of $11.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.1520663202,"EM Noise_100":0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

Despite only 28 of the scheduled 53 laps being completed, full points were awarded due to a loophole in the regulations regarding how points should be allocated, with the rules stating that reduced points should only be awarded in shortened races that end under red flag conditions. As this race ended under green flag conditions, this system was not applied. The wording of the sporting regulations was subsequently amended for 2023, so races that do not reach the 75 percent distance are awarded shortened race points regardless of whether a race finishes under red or green flag conditions.  The event was held across the weekend of the 7\u20139 October. It was the eighteenth round of the 2022 Formula One World Championship and the first time the event had been held since 2019, with the 2020 and 2021 races cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

A recovery vehicle was immediately dispatched, with several drivers passing the tractor at speed under double-yellow flags on the second lap.[13] Alex Albon also retired due a collision with Kevin Magnussen which caused damage to his radiator.[14]  The race resumed at 16:15 local time behind the safety car. Only twenty-eight laps were completed before the race was curtailed due to it passing the three-hour time limit, with Verstappen taking his twelfth victory of the season. Leclerc, who finished second on track, was given a five-second penalty for cutting the final chicane whist defending from P\u00e9rez in third, which demoted him to third behind P\u00e9rez.

Three decades after Dr. Sam Beckett (Scott Bakula) first stepped into the Quantum Leap accelerator and vanished, a new team, led by physicist Ben Song (Raymond Lee), has been assembled to restart the project in hope of understanding the mysteries behind the machine and the man who created it.

The company unveiled the GeForce RTX 4090 and GeForce RTX 4080 today at its GTC 2022 keynote. Taking full advantage of its new \"Ada Lovelace\" architecture, NVIDIA says the two GPUs offer significantly better ray tracing performance. The company worked with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) to co-develop a new \"4N\" fabrication process that NVIDIA says is up to two times more power efficient than the 8nm process it used for its 30 Series cards.\u00a0 Ray tracing performance is significantly improved thanks to Ada Lovelace featuring NVIDIA's new third-generation RT Cores, and the inclusion of a new rendering technique called Shader Execution Reordering and DLSS 3.0. In some games, NVIDIA said you can expect two to three times better ray tracing performance than what was possible with its Ampere GPUs. The company demoed Cyberpunk 2077 running at a near consistent 100 frames per second with all of the game's ray tracing features set to max. NVIDIA said rasterization performance is up to two times faster thanks to the new architecture.\u00a0\u00a0 The first of NVIDIA's new Ada Lovelace GPUs will arrive next month when the GeForce RTX 4090 goes on for sale for $1,599 on October 12th.","Jaccard Noise_20":1.0,"Cosine Noise_20":0.6602807045,"EM Noise_20":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":1,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"$1,599","Noise_40 Document Index":"2","Noise_40 Document":"When firing on all cylinders, Nvidia claims DLSS 3 can improve game framerates by up to 4x what they are without DLSS.

Going forward, Nvidia will have to balance its drive to sell more cards with sensitivity to customers who have been eagerly awaiting the chance to buy a new GPU at a reasonable price. While the $1,599 price tag on the new 4090 is anything but, the other cards in Nvidia's new 40-series should be significantly cheaper.

That being said, the latest episode of PD looks as though it will put Torres to the test. The plot synopsis for \u201cDonde Vives\u201d suggests that the rookie officer will be put in a situation that makes him question whether what he is doing is morally right. This is an interesting wrinkle to add, given how gung-ho Torres has been about getting in the field and following the orders of his commanding officer, Voight (Jason Beghe).

It was released worldwide on November 9, 2022, for both the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5, marking the first cross-gen release in the God of War series. It is the ninth installment in the series, the ninth chronologically, and the sequel to 2018's God of War. Loosely based on Norse mythology, the game is set in ancient Scandinavia and features series protagonist, Kratos, and his now teenage son, Atreus. Concluding the Norse era of the series, the game covers Ragnar\u00f6k, the eschatological event which is central to Norse mythology and was foretold to happen in the previous game after Kratos killed the Aesir god Baldur.  The gameplay is similar to the previous 2018 installment. It features combo-based combat, as well as puzzle and role-playing elements. The gameplay has been revamped from the previous game: in addition to Kratos' main weapons, a magical battle axe and his double-chained blades, he also acquires a magical spear and his shield has become more versatile, with different types of shields that have differing offensive and defensive abilities. His son Atreus, as well as some other characters, provide assistance in combat and can be passively controlled.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.6666666667,"Cosine Noise_0":0.7569320798,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"2022.","Noise_20 Document Index":"2","Noise_20 Document":"\/VvHuaCKgGn \u2014 Santa Monica Studio \u2013 God of War Ragnar\u00f6k (@SonySantaMonica) September 16, 2020  God of War Ragnarok is set to launch on November 9, 2022.

The ads tier subscription is $6.99 per month \u2013 almost 55% lower per month than its Standard subscription. While the monthly cost is lower for consumers, the newest tier comes with hidden price tags. In the new Netflix Basic with Ads tier, users can expect around 4-5 minutes of ads per hour. How is this comparable to other Connected TV subscriptions? While the amount of ad time per hour for Netflix is comparable to other streaming services, the lingering issue is\u00a0when an ad will show. Ad timings are unpredictable, which interrupts the user experience. The video content for ads is about what you expect compared to other streaming services. But the same issue is at hand \u2013 when will this show up in a user\u2019s watching experience on Netflix? According to Jay Peters from\u00a0 The Verge, a user\u2019s ad experience varies dramatically between types of content consumed: As you can see from this example, the amount of ads, as well as the placement of ads, is inconsistent, which leads to believe that Netflix is testing to find the best engagement for not only users but advertisers. The second nuance with Netflix Basic with Ads tier comes from what shows and movies are offered at this level.

In order to make the series as authentic as possible, White and his production team utilized several real locations in both seasons. The White Lotus has drawn critical acclaim due to how close its satire feels to reality, and the believability extends to the filming locations themselves.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.6872615218,"EM Noise_100":0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

In 2020, that worked to their advantage, and Democrats gained control of the chamber. In 2018, Democrats spent more, but the GOP gained House majority. Voter turnout is typically much lower in non-presidential elections. Since the 1980s, midterm voter turnout has hovered around 40%, whereas presidential cycles have reached over 60%. However, turnout during the Trump administration was high, particularly in the 2018 midterm election, which gave Nancy Pelosi her second stint as Speaker of the House. But because the stakes of the midterms were high this year, we saw more people turning up to the booths. After the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, Democrats used abortion rights to win special elections in places like New York\u2019s Hudson Valley, in addition to flipping Alaska\u2019s lone House seat. Republicans, on the other hand, pointed to high inflation rates, government spending, and crime rates, which ultimately drove many voters to cast their ballots for the GOP. Post-Dobbs, Democrats banked on voters supporting abortion rights in order to maintain control of the House. However, in keeping with midterm trends, Republicans were projected to make a net gain of five seats to bring them into the House majority.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.9768142104,"EM Noise_100":0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

The music video, directed by Tim Pope, won the British Video of the Year at the 1990 Brit Awards.  The meaning of \"Lullaby\" has been speculated by fans, including as a metonymy for addiction, depression, or sexual assault,[2] and Smith has offered multiple explanations as to its theme or content, such as childhood nightmares or abuse.[2] One explanation by Smith follows that the song is about the disturbing songs his father sung to him as a kid, and the horrible ending they would always have.[3] Tim Pope, a long-time collaborator of the Cure on many of its music videos, interprets \"Lullaby\" as an allegory for lead singer Robert Smith's drug-addled past.[4]  Upon its release, \"Lullaby\" became the Cure's highest-charting hit in their home country when it reached number five on the UK Singles Chart.

It's incredibly well-written and provides viewers with a glimpse of the Doctor's human side. Even before that though, Rose had a big impact on the series. Being the first companion of the modern era of Doctor Who may have phased some, but Billie Piper takes to the role like a duck to water. Rose's outgoing personality helped to bring balance to Eccleston's sullen and serious interpretation of the Doctor, while also playing a key, albeit, questionable, role in the events of the first series' climax.  Sarah-Jane Smith is easily the most popular companion of the classic era of Doctor Who and even returned for several of the modern episodes. She was first introduced as a traveling partner for the third Doctor back in 1973 though, before eventually going on to interact with eight of the other 12 doctors in some way, shape, or form. She was there when Davros created the Daleks on Skaro and came up against many of the series' most iconic villains at one point or another. Such was her popularity with series fans that Sarah-Jane even got her own spin-off series called The Sarah-Jane Adventures, which ran for five full seasons before Elisabeth Sladen's untimely death in 2011.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.5244355202,"EM Noise_100":0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

It has been a while since the profilers' last on-screen case, but the characters' stories continued during that period. Granted that revival retcons the Criminal Minds finale in several ways, it's essentially the same thing. That being said, Paramount+ just cannot simply use the title Criminal Minds season 16 because the project is different in a couple of significant ways from its original run. That includes veering away from its episodic storytelling format to a more serialized one, not to mention being darker and more disturbing than CBS' iteration.

The 2022 World Cup will be Messi\u2019s last chance to win it for Argentina. The last time Argentina came close to winning it was in 2014. Unfortunately, Messi\u2019s side lost to Germany in the final. However this time the Argentinians are well prepared and are in form. They just won the Copa America last year and are unbeaten in 36 matches. Argentina are the favourites alongside Brazil to win the 2022 World Cup. Let\u2019s assess the five potential knock-out stage opponents for Argentina in World Cup 2022. Provided that Argentina wins their group, they can face France in the Round Of 16. The last time this happened was in the 2018 World Cup but at Argentina\u2019s demise. Deschamps France beat Argentina 4-3 in a thrilling match. However this time Argentina can surely manage to beat France. Not only is Argentina in great form but France itself is lacking several players. Karim Benzema, Nkunku, Kante and Pogba are set to miss the World Cup. The presence of Benzema and especially Kante would have been crucial to put down Argentina. Despite France missing out on some players, they can still manage to outdo Argentina because of their squad depth. Kylian Mbappe is definitely a player to watch out for as he showed up last time against Argentina.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.335200429,"EM Noise_100":0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

It wanted a former college athlete, an exec passionate about higher education, an established corporate leader and a savvy politician who knows how to get things done in government. The governing body found all of those traits and more in Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker, a former Harvard basketball athlete and avid sports fan. The NCAA announced today that it has selected the two-term governor to be its next president. Baker will replace outgoing NCAA President Mark Emmert starting March 1. His second term as governor is slated to conclude Jan. 5; he announced about a year ago that he wouldn\u2019t seek a third term. Emmert will stay on as an adviser through June. The NCAA\u2019s choice of Baker, 66, signifies the association\u2019s desire to have a leader who is well-versed in the ways that Washington, D.C., works. With the NCAA facing so many legal and legislative challenges, the board of governors, who made the hire, focused on someone from the political arena early in the process and Baker emerged as the candidate with the experience and expertise to navigate the governmental and athletic worlds that often collide in college sports. When asked why he wanted the job, Baker replied, \u201cBecause it\u2019s worth doing. Yeah, it\u2019s big and complicated, but so have been a lot of things in my life.\u201c Baker represents the first NCAA leader who doesn\u2019t have a background in college athletics or higher education.","Jaccard Noise_40":1.0,"Cosine Noise_40":0.9882307053,"EM Noise_40":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":1,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"Charlie Baker","Noise_60 Document Index":"2","Noise_60 Document":"Mar 1, 2023 ...

The Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters are currently available on PC and mobile, and soon a new audience will be able to experience much of the history of the Final Fantasy franchise in a new way.  If that wasn't exciting enough, these versions come with a new pixel font, which seems to address one of the biggest issues fans had with the games when they first were released - the questionable choice of font by Square Enix for these remasters that left many unhappy. There will also be a new option to switch between the original and new background music whenever you so choose, and there are more options to adjust encounter rate, EXP, Gil, and ABP.  All six games will be available on April 19 at 8am PT\/11am ET\/4pm BST, and fans will be able to purchase them individually or as a complete package. On the eShop, the games range from $11.99-$17.99 per game, and all six can be purchased for $74.99.

The cutscenes are super sped up for some reason and for a game so focused on dumb \"quality of life\" there's not even an option to conveniently sort your inventory. The game looks nice and the remixed soundtrack is nice (though I'd like the option for the original soundtrack as well) but the complete ruined difficulty means that there really isn't much of a game to enjoy here.

He founded WinRumors, a site dedicated to Microsoft news, before joining The Verge in 2012. Microsoft is introducing a new consumer tier to its Microsoft 365 subscription offerings. Priced at just $1.99 per month, Microsoft 365 Basic is designed to replace the 100GB OneDrive storage option with some extra features that sit in between the free option and the $6.99 a month Personal subscription. Microsoft 365 Basic will be available worldwide on January 30th with 100GB of cloud storage, an ad-free Outlook web and mobile experience, and enhanced security features. The security features include data encryption for an Outlook mailbox, suspicious link checking, and virus \/ malware scanning for attachments. Existing OneDrive 100GB storage customers will be automatically upgraded to Microsoft 365 Basic at the same $1.99 monthly rate. \u201cLater this year, we\u2019ll have a bunch of stuff with OneDrive advanced security that will be available as well, that includes Personal Vault, password-protected and expiring links, ransomware detection and recovery, and bulk file restore,\u201d says Gareth Oystryk, director of product marketing for Microsoft 365, in an interview with The Verge.

The stream, hosted by a channel called watchmeforever, uses generative artificial intelligence to create an infinite stream of Seinfeld-esque content online. The novel idea has taken root on the platform, and at time of publication, the stream has roughly 15,400 concurrent viewers.

It sports a chunky 3D pixel style that looks a video game, and computerized voices that deliver an endless stream of Seinfeld-esque antics.  Skyler Hartle, a member of Mismatch Media, told Polygon that the stream uses various AI software to bring the show to life.

Jerry Seinfeld, Jason Alexander, and Wayne Knight, playing their respective Seinfeld characters, appeared in a spot presented during halftime of Super Bowl XLVIII on February 2, 2014.[200] FOX came up with the idea of doing such a spot, due in part to the Super Bowl's location being New York City adjacent that year.[200] An uncut version appeared on Crackle.com immediately afterward, as an episode of Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee titled \"The Over-Cheer\", establishing Seinfeld's character on the series as an older version of his Seinfeld character.[200] Although the spot was used to advertise Seinfeld's web series, it was not considered a commercial, as Sony, which produces the series, did not pay for it.","Jaccard Noise_100":0.0,"Cosine Noise_100":0.1721026599,"EM Noise_100":0,"EM - 2V Noise_100":0}

For more than three months, Google executives have watched as projects at Microsoft and a San Francisco start-up called OpenAI have stoked the public\u2019s imagination with the potential for artificial intelligence. But on Tuesday, Google tentatively stepped off the sidelines as it released a chatbot called Bard. The new A.I. chatbot will be available to a limited number of users in the United States and Britain and will accommodate additional users, countries and languages over time, Google executives said in an interview. The cautious rollout is the company\u2019s first public effort to address the recent chatbot craze driven by OpenAI and Microsoft, and it is meant to demonstrate that Google is capable of providing similar technology. But Google is taking a much more circumspect approach than its competitors, which have faced criticism that they are proliferating an unpredictable and sometimes untrustworthy technology. Still, the release represents a significant step to stave off a threat to Google\u2019s most lucrative business, its search engine. Many in the tech industry believe that Google \u2014 more than any other big tech company \u2014 has a lot to lose and to gain from A.I.","Jaccard Noise_20":1.0,"Cosine Noise_20":0.9606294036,"EM Noise_20":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":1,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"Bard,","Noise_40 Document Index":"7","Noise_40 Document":"Sections Bard might give incorrect answers, but it \u201cdoesn\u2019t go off the rails\u201d  Margaret Osborne  Daily Correspondent Google has launched Bard, its artificial intelligence (A.I.) chatbot, in the U.S. and U.K. this week.

SM also breaks out the financial performance of its various subsidiaries within its filing, including live entertainment company Dreammaker, which saw its revenues soar by 569.6% YoY to 24.5 billion South Korea Won ($18.4m) in Q3. That growth was driven by the reopening of concerts both domestically within South Korea and internationally following a lengthy break due to Covid. The publication of SM\u2019s results follows the news from earlier this month that Com2uS, a South Korean game publisher, had acquired a 4.2% stake in the company after buying 990,000 shares.

In an interview with Fox News\u2019s Tucker Carlson that will air next week, Musk warned that \u201cAI is more dangerous than, say, mismanaged aircraft design or production maintenance or bad car production.\u201d  \u201cIn the sense that it has the potential \u2014 however small one may regard that probability, but it is non-trivial \u2014 it has the potential of civilization destruction,\u201d he said. Musk was a co-founder of OpenAI, one of the leading artificial intelligence firms, but left the company in 2018 after a reported internal power struggle. He has reportedly sought to build a rival to OpenAI, recruiting artificial intelligence engineers for a new venture for months.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.9864166379,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"X.AI,","Noise_20 Document Index":"2","Noise_20 Document":"Apr 15, 2023 ...

The first Apple Stores were originally opened as two locations in May 2001 by then-CEO Steve Jobs, after years of attempting but failing store-within-a-store concepts. Seeing a need for improved retail presentation of the company's products, he began an effort in 1997 to revamp the retail program to get an improved relationship with consumers and hired Ron Johnson in 2000. Jobs relaunched Apple's online store in 1997 and opened the first two physical stores in 2001. The media initially speculated that Apple would fail, but its stores were highly successful, bypassing the sales numbers of competing nearby stores and within three years reached US$1\u00a0billion in annual sales, becoming the fastest retailer in history to do so.

Star Wars Jedi: Survivor has a different role for Cordova, but that\u2019s something you\u2019ll have to learn for yourself. A traveling aficionado with a penchant for trouble, Cal and Greez took a while to warm to each other, but by the end of the Fallen Order it\u2019s clear that Greez is all-for-one and one-for-all when it comes to his team. Another character that took some convincing, arguably a lot more given her run-in with lightsabers in the past, Nightsister Merrin would not only go on to become a valuable ally, but she also saves the life of Cal at the end of Fallen Order. Merrin plays a key part in Survivor and is classed as one of the main side characters, often fighting side by side with Cal and forming a fantastic partnership with him. A new character for Survivor is Rayvis \u2013 a hulking, armored figure who instructs one of his cronies to eliminate Cal Kestis. The foe proves to be a thorn in Cal\u2019s side during Star Wars Jedi: Survivor and is also a pretty tricky battle to overcome too.

The screens on early review samples of its Galaxy Fold failed, forcing the South Korean manufacturer to postpone the product. Samsung and others have since released a few more foldable phones, but none were compelling to me. Google\u2019s entry into the market is significant. Mirroring Apple\u2019s tight control of the iPhone\u2019s design, Google designed both the hardware (including the computing processor) and software that power the Pixel Fold. That means the device\u2019s software was tailored to work with it, and it has long battery life and very fast performance. Beyond the bigger screen, Google has come up with clever reasons for how and why you might use a foldable phone. For one, the Pixel Fold is a great video player to use everywhere because of the way it folds at an angle like a laptop. When I cooked in the kitchen, I played a YouTube video with a recipe and folded the device at a 90-degree angle. The upper half of the screen showed the video, and the lower half showed the description listing the ingredients.

And it\u2019s all powered by our Google Tensor G2 chip, which also makes Pixel Fold fast and secure. Here\u2019s a look at the newest addition to our Pixel portfolio. When closed, Pixel Fold has a familiar smartphone silhouette that fits in the palm of your hand and slides into your pocket. Flip it open to reveal a 7.6-inch screen with a thinner profile than any other foldable phone in the market.1 To create this foldable design, we didn\u2019t compromise on form and function. Many of the Pixel components \u2014 from camera, battery, speakers and haptics technology \u2014 were cleverly redesigned to fit within the thin design. Our custom-built hinge not only contributes to that thinness, but also doubles as the most durable hinge out there.2 And last","Jaccard Noise_60":0.6666666667,"Cosine Noise_60":0.9008514881,"EM Noise_60":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_60":1,"Noise_80 Predicted Answer":"Pixel Fold","Noise_80 Document Index":"2","Noise_80 Document":"Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google introduced a $1,799 foldable smartphone, a new entry-level Pixel phone and a tablet for the home, its latest attempt to spark hardware sales in an arena saturated by Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co.

OpenAI on Thursday announced the launch of a free ChatGPT app for iOS users in the United States, with plans to roll out to other countries soon.           The launch comes six months after OpenAI first released ChatGPT online to the public. The release quickly sparked a new AI arms race in the tech industry to develop and deploy tools that can generate compelling written work and images in response to user prompts.           It also comes the same week that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman testified before Congress on the risks that AI may pose to society, describing the technology\u2019s current boom as a potential \u201cprinting press moment\u201d but one that required safeguards.           The new ChatGPT app has the same capabilities as the web version of the viral chatbot tool, and could help build on its popularity. With the app, users will also be able to send voice prompts through their phone\u2019s microphone, rather than just typing them. Users can also sync their history across devices.           Those who pay $20 a month to subscribe to ChatGPT Plus will get extra benefits on the app, including access to GPT-4 capabilities, the next-generation version of the technology underpinning the tool.","Jaccard Noise_80":0.25,"Cosine Noise_80":0.8564267159,"EM Noise_80":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_80":0,"Noise_100 Predicted Answer":"May 19, 2023","Noise_100 Document Index":"7","Noise_100 Document":"OpenAI alludes to this in its blog post, noting that users can get instant answers \u201cwithout sifting through ads or multiple results.\u201d The statement is a subtle burn on its own partner, as Bing is already slipping ads into its AI-powered Bing Chat, in addition to somewhat snubbing search engines.

The app\u2019s arrival also comes only days after Google lifted the waitlist from its own AI chatbot, Bard, which it announced during this month\u2019s Google I\/O developer conference was now available in English. There does seem to be some consumer demand for ChatGPT and AI on the iPhone.

The No.1 pick in the draft is awarded to the team that successfully draws the winning four-number combination from the lottery machine.

The previous CBA that ended the 2011 lockout instituted no immediate changes to the draft, but it called for a committee of owners and players to discuss further charges.  Players who were not automatically eligible had to declare their eligibility for the draft by notifying the NBA offices in writing no later than at least 60 days before the event. For the 2023 draft, the date fell on April 23. Under the CBA a player may withdraw his name from consideration from the draft at any time before the final declaration deadline, which usually falls 10 days before the draft at 5:00 pm EDT (2100 UTC). Under current NCAA rules, players usually have until 10 days after the draft combine to withdraw from the draft and retain college eligibility.

The Vision Pro has two buttons on the top of the headset. One is an action button that allows you to take spatial photos and videos.

The other button is a crown similar to the Apple Watch, which can control the level of immersion you are in while wearing the headset.\u00a0 One way we know this crown will be used is to engage the Vision Pro's Cinema Environments. These 13 locations will become the Vision Pro's background as you watch movies on the simulated 100-foot screen, provided you crank up the immersion on the Vision Pro's dial. Finally, there's one last major design note. The Apple Vision Pro can be used all day when plugged in but otherwise needs an external battery to work. This battery lasts for about two hours and connects to the headset via a woven cable. Unfortunately, that means you'll need yet another proprietary Apple charger. What looks like a USB-C adapter was recently spotted attached to the headset in a WWDC developer video.

Maven founder and CEO Kate Ryder joined Scarlet Fu, Bloomberg Television and Bloomberg QuickTake host, for an online talk on Thursday, September 30, as part of the Cornell Tech @ Bloomberg Speaker Series. She shared the story of her career transition from journalism to venture capitalist to entrepreneurship, the birth of her startup, and the lessons she\u2019s learned on the road to building a company valued at more than $1 billion. Ryder is a born storyteller, having begun her career as a journalist, writing about finance and business.

While some exceptions do apply, Amazon's standard return policy also applies to items purchased during Prime Day. This bestselling one-piece has been called \"the unicorn of swimsuits\" for its flattering fit.  Like previous years, 2023 Prime Day took place over a two-day span, Tuesday, July 11 and Wednesday, July 12. Amazon Prime Day dates for 2024 have not yet been announced. According to Amazon, the event originally started as a summer savings event to celebrate Amazon's birthday, which launched in July 2015. Due to the pandemic, the retailer pushed Prime Day 2020 to October and then moved back to the summer months with Prime Day 2021 and Prime Day 2022 falling in June and July. However, in October 2022, the retailer introduced a second two-day sale event that year: \"Prime Early Access Sale.\" This gave Amazon Prime members another chance to score savings ahead of the Black Friday and Cyber Monday shopping weekend. A monthly Prime membership costs $14.99 a month, but you can also purchase an annual membership for $139, which ultimately saves you a few dollars a month.

Historically, Prime Day has been a chance for Amazon to heavily promote its own products, like its Alexa-enabled devices. Those gadgets usually make the retailer\u2019s list of Prime Day bestsellers each year. But for the past few years, Amazon has invested more heavily in spotlighting marketplace sellers in their deals. And it\u2019s paying off for third-party merchants participating in the sale.
