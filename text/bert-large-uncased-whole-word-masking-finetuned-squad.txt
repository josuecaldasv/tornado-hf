                          Edwin Hodge injects some diversity into the main cast as Malcolm Kingsley, a member of the wealthy
                          Kinglsey family who underwrites the funding for the hospital. As the hospital's new head of
                          finance, he also serves as a love interest for Sam, who is just getting over a previous
                          relationship. Sam's team of doctors (Skye P. Marshall, Omar Maskati, Davi Santos, Michael
                          Stahl-David) round out the secondary characters, most notably Marshall, who plays Dr. Lex Trulie,
                          her best friend hiding a huge secret. Overall, Good Sam riffs on what CBS is known for --
                          comforting problem-of-the-week dramas -- and adds a new level of spice and interest to the
                          proceedings. Fans of the genre will undoubtedly want to go on the ride Good Sam has in store for

                          demonstrate great leadership? How does Sam provide compassion and empathy to her patients and
                          fellow doctors? Why does Sam feel unappreciated? How did she prove herself in the show? How should
                          Sam's father, Dr. Rob Griffith, treat his daughter? Research shows a connection between kids'
                          healthy self-esteem and positive portrayals in media. That's why we've added a new "Diverse

                          accelerated the world’s transition to sustainable energy. Tesla’s annual production rates have
                          steadily been increasing. In 2014, the company made only 35,000 vehicles. In the first half of
                          2021, Tesla produced 386,759 cars, with 184,877 vehicles delivered in Q1 and 201,304 in Q2.
                          Overall, in 2021, Tesla produced 930,422 EVs and delivered 936,222, thereby setting a new record.
                          Compared to 2020, these numbers suggest a year-over-year growth of 82.5%. There were 906,032 Model
                          3/Y vehicles produced, which constituted a growth of 99%, compared to 2020. In the same year, Tesla
                          produced 24,390 Model S/X cars, 56% less year-over-year. The deliveries of the latter model were
                          also 56% down by comparison to 2020, standing at 24,980 vehicles. Deliveries of the Tesla Model 3/Y
                          amounted to 911,242, which was 106% higher than in 2020. In the first and the second quarters of
                          this year, Tesla made 564,750 vehicles.

                          478,078 were made in Tesla’s production facility, Gigafactory Shanghai. From its American
                          facilities, Gigafactory Texas and Gigafactory California, Tesla sold 301,998 vehicles. The company
                          is gaining popularity in Europe. In 2021, it sold 169,507 vehicles in European countries, where the
                          Tesla Model 3 was named Europe’s favorite electric vehicle. In 2019, the Netherlands bought the
                          largest number of Tesla cars among European countries – 30,911 vehicles. Norway and Germany
                          followed the Netherlands’ example with 18,798 and 10,711 cars purchased respectively. In Europe,
                          the annual sales of Tesla have been showing the following upward trajectory since 2012: In the
                          United States, Tesla was the first manufacturer to reach 200,000 cumulative sales of electric
                          vehicles, arriving at the end of its government subsidy cap of $,5000 per sold car. In other words,
                          since January 2020, no Tesla vehicle sold in the USA has received any subsidy. The annual sales of
                          Tesla vehicles in the US were as follows: Tesla started the production of its vehicles in China in
                          2018. In January 2020, Tesla’s Chinese Gigafactory started the output of the Tesla Model 3 Sedan
                          and batteries. The production of the Tesla Model Y began on the Chinese mainland in 2021.

                          Angeles Rams defeated the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Cincinnati Bengals, 23–20.
                          The game was played on February 13, 2022, at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, the home

                          playing and winning in its home stadium.[13][14][15][16] The Rams' victory was their second, first

                          in St. Louis. Finishing with a 12–5 record, the Rams reached their fifth appearance after acquiring
                          veteran quarterback Matthew Stafford, who had not won a playoff game in his previous 12 years with
                          the Detroit Lions. The Bengals, who finished with a 10–7 record, were seeking their first Super
                          Bowl title following several decades of losing seasons and playoff struggles. They won their first
                          playoff game since 1990, ending the longest drought in the four major North American sports, en

                          Sunday, Feb. 13, 2022. It marks the first time since 2003 that the Super Bowl has not been held on
                          the first Sunday in February. Because of the NFL's expanded, 17-game, 18-week schedule, it will be
                          held on the second Sunday in February. This is the latest that a Super Bowl has ever been held.
                          Super Bowls 44, 50 and 55 all were held on Feb. 7, which was previously the record for the latest
                          Super Bowl. Under the NFL's new format, the latest date on which a Super Bowl can occur is Feb. 14.
                          NBC is set to broadcast the Super Bowl. Al Michael, Cris Collinsworth and the rest of the "Sunday
                          Night Football" crew will presumably broadcast the event. NBC's last Super Bowl broadcast came in

                          and the Chargers — will host the Super Bowl in 2022. Originally, the new stadium, which opened in
                          2020, was scheduled to host the Super Bowl in 2021. However, weather-related construction delays
                          caused the league to move the 2021 Super Bowl to Raymond James Stadium in Tampa Bay, Fla. and the
                          2022 Super Bowl to Los Angeles.

                          televised exclusively by NBC—the NFL announced on March 13, 2019, that NBC had agreed to swap
                          2021's Super Bowl LV to CBS in exchange for Super Bowl LVI. Such a swap out of the normal rotation
                          was done before when CBS was given Super Bowl XXVI in January 1992 after it acquired the rights to
                          the 1992 Winter Olympics (which started 13 days later), and NBC then aired Super Bowl XXVII and

                          Olympics. In all the other previous Winter Olympics years, the league stuck to the normal broadcast
                          cycle regardless of which network was broadcasting the Olympics. However, Super Bowl LVI was the
                          first Super Bowl to actually occur when the Winter Olympics were already underway: primetime

                          advertising revenue for CBS and NBC,[117][118] and there is an unsaid gentleman's agreement between
                          the NFL's broadcasters to not air competing original programming against the Super Bowl.

                          Store's top charts.[99][100] Due to an extensive backlog of applicants, upon downloading the app,

                          waitlisted.[101][102][103] The app was installed 872,000 times during its first week, but a month
                          later, new user signup had fallen to 60,000 per week. During that time, weekly visits to
                          truthsocial.com fell from 6 million to fewer than 2 million.[104] Upon its launch, the British
                          automotive solar power company Trailar complained Truth Social's app logo closely resembled its "T"

                          beginning to lose interest in the app due to low numbers of users and poor engagement, although
                          others were willing to persevere with the app to see if things would improve.[107] The Truth Social
                          platform suffered from severe and persistent problems with scalability at launch, limiting the

                          automotive solar power company Trailar complained Truth Social's app logo closely resembled its "T"
                          logo.[105] The platform has been criticized for its poor performance at launch, with waitlisting
                          users attempting to register and extended outages.[106] A day after its launch, The Washington Post
                          described it as "a disaster".[101] A week after, Newsweek reported some early adopters were
                          beginning to lose interest in the app due to low numbers of users and poor engagement, although
                          others were willing to persevere with the app to see if things would improve.[107] The Truth Social
                          platform suffered from severe and persistent problems with scalability at launch, limiting the
                          platform's growth.[108][109]

                          be held on Sunday, Jan. 9, 2022. Chris Pizzello / AP The nominees for best picture, drama, went to

                          On the TV side, ABC comedy Abbott Elementary — which boasted the most nominations of any show with
                          five — built off of its Emmy momentum and went to the head of the class, winning best comedy honors
                          and Golden Globes for Quinta Brunson and Tyler James Williams. An even bigger Emmy magnet, HBO's
                          The White Lotus, enjoyed the privilege of converting its four nominations into two awards, one for
                          best limited series and another for Jennifer Coolidge (who also delivered the funniest speech of
                          the night). And then Game of Thrones prequel House of the Dragon added some surprise to the night
                          by claiming the best drama award. Elsewhere, Tár's Cate Blanchett, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever's
                          Angela Bassett, and Elvis' Austin Butler scored trophies, along with The Bear's Jeremy Allen White,

Question 12              : Who won the Spanish Super Cup 2022?
Correct Answers         :  
                          Real Madrid
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prediction (only positive):
  - Answer              : Barcelona

  - Source              :
                          Barcelona produced an impressive performance to beat Real Madrid 3-1 and lift the Spanish Super Cup
                          on Sunday. It was Xavi’s first trophy as Barça manager as his new generation of stars look to
                          reestablish themselves in the post-Lionel Messi era at the club. There is certainly cause for
                          excitement as fans watched their team breeze past their fierce rivals in the one-sided final in
                          Saudi Arabia. Gavi, who was named the world’s best young player at the Ballon d’Or awards last
                          year, was the star of the show after scoring the opener and assisting both Robert Lewandowski and
                          Pedri. The 18-year-old’s quality on the ball and movement off it was too much for Madrid’s defense
                          and fans will hope it’s a sign of better things to come for a club that has been mired in financial
                          controversy in recent years. “We knew that it was an opportunity that we had to seize, we are going
                          through a time of changes in the club and in the dressing room, and this win will strengthen us to
                          continue fighting for more titles,” Barcelona captain Sergio Busquets told Movistar Plus. Karim
                          Benzema did score a late consolation for Real Madrid but, in truth, the score could have been a lot
                          worse for Carlo Ancelotti’s side if it hadn’t been for some smart saves from Thibaut Courtois.

                          Barcelona produced an impressive performance to beat Real Madrid 3-1 and lift the Spanish Super Cup
                          on Sunday. It was Xavi’s first trophy as Barça manager as his new generation of stars look to
                          reestablish themselves in the post-Lionel Messi era at the club. There is certainly cause for
                          excitement as fans watched their team breeze past their fierce rivals in the one-sided final in
                          Saudi Arabia. Gavi, who was named the world’s best young player at the Ballon d’Or awards last
                          year, was the star of the show after scoring the opener and assisting both Robert Lewandowski and
                          Pedri. The 18-year-old’s quality on the ball and movement off it was too much for Madrid’s defense
                          and fans will hope it’s a sign of better things to come for a club that has been mired in financial
                          controversy in recent years. “We knew that it was an opportunity that we had to seize, we are going
                          through a time of changes in the club and in the dressing room, and this win will strengthen us to
                          continue fighting for more titles,” Barcelona captain Sergio Busquets told Movistar Plus. Karim
                          Benzema did score a late consolation for Real Madrid but, in truth, the score could have been a lot
                          worse for Carlo Ancelotti’s side if it hadn’t been for some smart saves from Thibaut Courtois.

Question 13              : How much is Microsoft acquiring Activision Blizzard for?
Correct Answers         :

                          Filed under: There’s a steady drip of news as the tech giant tries to clear its huge deal — here’s
                          what’s new Microsoft is attempting to persuade regulators around the world to clear its $68.7
                          billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard — the biggest deal of its kind the gaming industry has
                          ever seen. Amid concerns about its effect on competition in the industry — particularly in the
                          nascent cloud gaming market — and in the face of ardent lobbying against the deal by competitor
                          Sony, the U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority first decided to block the acquisition, then
                          agreed to further talks with Microsoft and Activision. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has
                          withdrawn its attempt block the deal legally after a federal judge ruled in favor of Microsoft
                          being allowed to close the deal. The European Union, meanwhile, has given the deal its seal of
                          approval. Here’s the latest on Microsoft’s plans to snap up Activision Blizzard. According to
                          Reuters and Bloomberg, the Federal Trade Commission has withdrawn its administrative case against
                          Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard, which was due to go before an in-house judge in
                          August. Microsoft and Activision had requested the case be withdrawn after the FTC lost its case
                          arguing for a block on the deal in district court, and was denied an extension of a temporary block
                          by an appeals court. The move means Microsoft and Activision can now try to persuade the U.S.
                          antitrust regulator to accept a settlement.

  - Source              :
                          12] In January 2022, The Verge reported that Google was building an AR headset which used
                          "outward-facing cameras to blend computer graphics with a video feed of the real world", internally
                          codenamed Project Iris and being developed in a highly secretive and secure facility located in the
                          San Francisco Bay Area. Overseen by Bavor, the headset was to be powered by the Android operating
                          system as well as a custom system on a chip akin to Tensor, expected to launch in 2024 alongside
                          Project Starline. Other key people named as part of the project include Shahram Izadi, Eddie Chung,
                          Scott Huffman, Kurt Akeley, and Lucovsky.[13] An early prototype of the headset bore a close
                          resemblance to the North Focals.[14] In March, The Information reported that Google would acquire
                          Raxium, an AR hardware startup, for approximately $1 billion, and would continue to make further
                          acquisitions to assist in their AR and mixed reality (MR) work.[15] The acquisition was completed a
                          month later.[16] In May 2022, Google unveiled a different version of Iris resembling eyeglasses
                          with live translation capabilities during the 2022 Google I/O keynote.[14][17][18] The company
                          began publicly testing these prototypes across the U.S. in August,[19] before expanding into Canada
                          in October.[20] According to Business Insider, Google executives' constantly changing strategy for
                          Project Iris frustrated employees.

                          Unlike organic light-emitting diode OLED technology, MicroLED and Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) are
                          also inorganic, but it has the same qualities as OLED such as high brightness, good color fidelity,
                          high resolution, and high contrast. What's more, MicroLED is much less energy efficient, a key
                          requirement for wearable devices such as AR headsets. This is one of the reasons why technology has
                          become a key technology for strategic investment in the smart glasses sector. Although Raxium has
                          not yet launched a marketed product, it has reportedly developed a more effective MicroLED
                          manufacturing technology that will use the same silicon as the raw material for most processors for
                          manufacturing and will significantly reduce production costs. Currently, MicroLED technology is
                          mainly used only for wall-mounted signs and other large and expensive screens. In addition to
                          Google, many other hardware companies are also investing and developing in the MicroLED field. For
                          example, OPPO's Air Glass, which will be released at the end of 2021, is already equipped with
                          MicroLED technology. Apple acquired a MicroLED startup in 2014; Meta is currently working with
                          Plessey on MicroLED technology, and Samsung's MicroLED TVs are already on sale. In the AR device
                          space, Google has many competitors. In addition to rebranding the Oculus Quest as "Quest" and
                          launching the Quest 2 virtual reality headset, Meta is also working on a new AR device codenamed
                          "Project Cambria".

Question 18              : What is the name of Meta's AI supercomputer?
Correct Answers         :  
                          RSC, the AI Research SuperCluster
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prediction (only positive):
  - Answer              : RSC
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          Image Credits: Meta But beyond keeping up with the Joneses, Meta says that the RSC confers the
                          benefit of allowing its researchers to train models using real-world examples from Meta’s
                          production systems. That’s unlike the company’s previous AI infrastructure, which leveraged only
                          open source and publicly available datasets. “The RSC AI supercomputer is used for pushing the
                          boundaries of AI research in several domains, including generative AI,” a Meta spokesperson said.
                          “It’s really about AI research productivity. We wanted to provide AI researchers with a
                          state-of-the-art infrastructure for them to be able to develop models and empower them with a
                          training platform to advance AI.” At its peak, the RSC can reach nearly 5 exaflops of computing
                          power, which the company claims makes it among the world’s fastest. (Lest that impress, it’s worth
                          noting some experts view the exaflops performance metric with a pinch of salt and that the RSC is
                          far outgunned by many of the world’s fastest supercomputers.) Meta says that it used the RSC to
                          train LLaMA, a tortured acronym for “Large Language Model Meta AI” — a large language model that
                          the company shared as a “gated release” to researchers earlier in the year (and which subsequently
                          leaked in various internet communities). The largest LLaMA model was trained on 2,048 A100 GPUs,
                          Meta says, which took 21 days.

                          AI supercomputers and regular supercomputers can’t necessarily be compared apples to apples The
                          brief explanation is that machine learning requires less accuracy than the tasks put to traditional
                          supercomputers, and so “AI supercomputers” (a bit of recent branding) can carry out more
                          calculations per second than their regular brethren using the same hardware. That means when Meta
                          says it’s built the “world’s fastest AI supercomputer,” it’s not necessarily a direct comparison to
                          the supercomputers you often see in the news (rankings of which are compiled by the independent
                          Top500.org and published twice a year). To explain this a little more, you need to know that both
                          supercomputers and AI supercomputers make calculations using what is known as floating-point
                          arithmetic — a mathematical shorthand that’s extremely useful for making calculations using very
                          large and very small numbers (the “floating point” in question is the decimal point, which “floats”
                          between significant figures). The degree of accuracy deployed in floating-point calculations can be
                          adjusted based on different formats, and the speed of most supercomputers is calculated using what
                          are known as 64-bit floating-point operations per second, or FLOPs. However, because AI
                          calculations require less accuracy, AI supercomputers are often measured in 32-bit or even 16-bit
                          FLOPs.

Question 19              : When will American students start taking digital SAT exams?

                          Elissa Nadworny The SAT, a college admissions exam long associated with paper and pencil, will soon
                          go all-digital. Starting in 2023 for international students and in 2024 in the U.S., the new
                          digital SAT will shrink from three hours to two, include shorter reading passages and allow
                          students to use a calculator on the math section. Testing will still take place at a test center or
                          at a school, but students will be able to choose between using their own devices — including a
                          tablet or a laptop — or the schools' devices. "The digital SAT will be easier to take, easier to
                          give, and more relevant," said Priscilla Rodriguez of the College Board, the organization behind
                          the test. "With input from educators and students, we are adapting to ensure we continue to meet
                          their evolving needs." The College Board previously scrapped plans to offer an at-home digital test
                          because of concern about students being able to access three hours of uninterrupted internet and
                          power. Student broadband access has been a constant struggle throughout the pandemic, especially in
                          rural and low-income areas. The new SAT will be designed to autosave, so students won't lose work
                          or time while they reconnect. All this comes as the relevance of the SAT and ACT, another college
                          entrance exam, is being called into question in the college admissions process. More than 1,800 U.S.

                          test while also allowing students more time per question. This means that for the digital SAT
                          Suite, each test section (Reading and Writing, Math) is divided into two parts called modules.
                          Students answer a set of questions in the first module before moving on to the next. The questions
                          that students are given in the second module depend on how they performed on the first module.
                          Students will be able to practice with the new digital adaptive format starting this fall. Many
                          large-scale assessments use adaptive testing, and more than 30 years of research shows the benefits
                          of adaptive testing, including: Read more Students can take the digital SAT Suite on a laptop or

                          Elissa Nadworny The SAT, a college admissions exam long associated with paper and pencil, will soon
                          go all-digital. Starting in 2023 for international students and in 2024 in the U.S., the new
                          digital SAT will shrink from three hours to two, include shorter reading passages and allow
                          students to use a calculator on the math section. Testing will still take place at a test center or
                          at a school, but students will be able to choose between using their own devices — including a
                          tablet or a laptop — or the schools' devices. "The digital SAT will be easier to take, easier to
                          give, and more relevant," said Priscilla Rodriguez of the College Board, the organization behind
                          the test. "With input from educators and students, we are adapting to ensure we continue to meet
                          their evolving needs." The College Board previously scrapped plans to offer an at-home digital test
                          because of concern about students being able to access three hours of uninterrupted internet and
                          power. Student broadband access has been a constant struggle throughout the pandemic, especially in
                          rural and low-income areas. The new SAT will be designed to autosave, so students won't lose work
                          or time while they reconnect. All this comes as the relevance of the SAT and ACT, another college
                          entrance exam, is being called into question in the college admissions process. More than 1,800 U.S.

                          PhD, has been awarded the 2022 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his groundbreaking research in
                          developing “click chemistry,” an ingenious method for building molecules. Sharpless, the W.M. Keck
                          Professor of Chemistry, shares the prize with Carolyn R. Bertozzi, PhD, of Stanford University and
                          Morten Meldal, PhD, of the University of Copenhagen for the development of click chemistry and
                          bioorthogonal chemistry, according to the Nobel Prize committee. Sharpless previously shared the
                          2001 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on chirally catalyzed oxidation reactions, making him
                          the second scientist ever to win two Nobel Prizes in Chemistry. Frederick Sanger won the Nobel
                          Prize in Chemistry in 1958 and 1980. “Barry Sharpless has had a tremendous impact on chemistry,
                          first with his development of asymmetric synthesis and now with his elegant ‘click chemistry,’”
                          says Peter Schultz, PhD, President and CEO of Scripps Research. “His work opened whole new
                          scientific frontiers that have had a major impact on the fields of chemistry, biology and medicine.

                          living processes work and to watch those processes in action, even in real time,” said Dr. Lorsch,

                          laureates’ work. “The field of click chemistry is still in its early phases,” she said, adding that
                          there were “many new reactions to be discovered and invented,” as well as new ways to integrate the
                          science in industries like biotechnology. One such application is in “drug delivery,” which
                          involves “doing chemistry inside living patients to make sure drugs go to the right place and not
                          to the wrong place.” But all those plans for the future came after her surprise, which registered
                          when she first called into the committee. “I’m absolutely stunned. I’m sitting here and can hardly
                          breathe,” she said. “I’m still not entirely positive that it’s real — but it’s getting realer by
                          the minute.” The prize was awarded to Benjamin List and David W.C. MacMillan for their development
                          of a tool that spurred research into new drugs and reduced chemistry’s effect on the environment.

                          constantly, in our drinks, on the tips of our fingers, in our phones. These reactions create new
                          molecules, break down old ones, allow energy swaps — they shape the variegated dynamics of the
                          universe. For scientists looking to understand these forces, combining molecules in a controlled
                          way can be difficult, especially in a delicate environment like a living cell, because everything
                          is so closely connected. Often the surrounding molecules are disturbed in the process, changing the
                          very thing a researcher wants to study. In 2001, Dr. Sharpless and some of his colleagues published
                          a paper introducing something he called click chemistry, a new way of approaching this kind of
                          molecular control when applied to the creation of new drug compounds. The method would be based
                          around one rule, he wrote: “All searches must be restricted to molecules that are easy to make.”
                          Instead of trying to synthesize, or chemically create, molecules by forcing a difficult organic
                          bond, Dr. Sharpless, said, focus instead on bonds that form fast and produce stable byproducts. If
                          done in the right way, the tougher bonds will form automatically, clicking into place. Think of
                          them “as gifts of nature,” Dr. Sharpless wrote.

                          After taking a hit that rendered his left arm almost immobile, Stafford fought off the team’s
                          trainers to get back on the field and then threw a last-second, game-winning touchdown to Brandon
                          Pettigrew. It was rough in those early days. Stafford started just three games in 2010, as that
                          ugly “injury-prone” tag started to swirl around him. He came back in 2011 to lead the league in
                          passing attempts and guide Detroit to a surprising playoff berth. Those images from Sunday night —

  - Source              :
                          Lost Ark was fully released in South Korea on December 4, 2019, and in North American, South
                          American, and European regions on February 11, 2022, with Amazon Games serving as the global
                          publisher.[16] Users that pre-purchased one of four founder's packs could play 3 days early on
                          February 8, 2022.[17][18][19][20] The game was initially unavailable in Belgium and the Netherlands
                          due to the countries' stringent loot box regulations,[21] with the latter later reversing its
                          decision.[22] Within twenty-four hours of its release, Lost Ark became the second most played game
                          on Steam.[23][24] In 2021, there were plans between Smilegate and game publisher HappyTuk [zh] to
                          launch Lost Ark in Taiwan.[25] It was announced in 2023 that the release of Taiwanese servers has
                          been delayed but not canceled.[26] Lost Ark received "generally favorable" reviews according to
                          review aggregator Metacritic.[27] PC Magazine praised Lost Ark's combat, writing, "Abilities look
                          good, sound sufficiently powerful, and feel great to use. You can’t help but feel like a combat god

                          Lost Ark‘s free-to-play launch time is that we already saw players struggle to join Lost Ark in
                          time for its exact Early Access debut. Between congested servers and a few technical issues, many
                          fans found themselves waiting at least a little longer to actually start playing the MMO. Given
                          that the game is being opened up to a significantly larger player base on Friday, it’s likely that
                          you’ll have to navigate similar server issues at that time.

                          BEIJING — Jessie Diggins brought home the United States’ 25th and final medal of the 2022 Olympic
                          Games, winning silver in the grueling 30km mass start cross-country race while fighting off both

                          race went off under relatively balmy 14-degree temperatures and the kind of slate-blue skies that

                          least a minute ahead of the rest of the pack. Diggins, whose surprise gold in the team sprint in
                          PyeongChang vaulted her to national prominence, was a busy woman at these Games. She competed in
                          all six cross country events, placing top 8 in all of them — the only woman to pull off that feat —
                          and in addition to her silver, also won a bronze in the sprint. The hilly 7.

                          October 30, 2020 • 3 For the last decade, Marvel has led the adaptations of superhero comic books
                          into films. In 2019, the journey culminated in the release of Avengers: Endgame, which premiered to
                          critical and commercial success. It had gone from a story about a playboy billionaire (Tony
                          Stark/Iron Man) to a larger story than spanned universes as well as heroes and villains alike.
                          Although, as the universe expanded, it was hard to ignore that Marvel’s roster of superheroes still
                          lacked diversity. This was made even more apparent when other superhero stories started to make
                          their way into the mainstream. In the same year that Endgame came out, a quiet and subversive TV
                          show was making waves. The Boys is adapted from a graphic novel of the same name, one that is
                          notorious amongst fans and haters alike for its crude, graphic and violent nature. The series
                          considers what would happen if superheroes existed in the real world. The short answer is that they
                          would become an untouchable commodity that could wreak havoc, which would be cleaned up by their
                          slick and all-powerful parent company Vought. The series touches on power, social media, politics
                          and causes the line between hero and villain to become truly blurred. It is difficult not to draw
                          comparisons between the storylines in The Boys and the reality of the MCU (Marvel Cinematic
                          Universe).

                          and south. He says the “special military operation” is aimed at “demilitarization” and
                          “denazification” of the country to protect ethnic Russians, prevent Kyiv’s NATO membership and to

                          relatives were killed in the Holocaust. Russian troops quickly reach Kyiv’s outskirts, but their

                          sets.[69] In February 2023, Świątek successfully defended her title at the WTA 500 Qatar Open. She
                          defeated Jessica Pegula in the final in straight sets. This was her first title of the year and the
                          twelfth of her career. She did not drop a set throughout the tournament and only lost five
                          games.[70] At the Dubai Tennis Championships, she defeated Leylah Fernandez, 14th seed Liudmila
                          Samsonova, Karolina Pliskova (by walkover) and fifth seed Coco Gauff, all matches in straight sets

                          in the semifinals, preventing Świątek from defending her Indian Wells title. [78] Due to a rib
                          injury suffered during the Indian Wells event, Świątek withdrew from the 2023 Miami Open, which
                          also prevented her from defending her Miami Open title.

                          The second set was entirely different from the first. While Jabeur again didn't win a game until
                          Swiatek was up 3-0, she finally found her gear. Her excellent slice finally began to appear and she
                          began going to the net more, helping her win four of the next five games. Swiatek appeared to have
                          finally wrestled the momentum of the match back to her side, breaking a 5-5 tie to get within one
                          game of the title, but she couldn't close and Jabeur tied it up once again. The tiebreak was close,
                          and it looked like Jabeur could run away with it at any moment, but an unforced error from Jabeur
                          ended the tiebreak and gave Swiatek her first US Open championship and her third career Grand Slam
                          trophy. When it was all over, Swiatek and Jabeur shared a heartfelt embrace, and then Swiatek
                          immediately burst into happy tears. She'd earned it. This victory puts an exclamation point on the
                          best year of Swiatek's young career — or the best year of anyone’s career, really. She started 2022
                          by falling just short of the finals at the Australian Open (she was knocked out in the semis by
                          Danielle Collins), but she rebounded to produce one of the most dominant stretches of tennis we’ve
                          seen in decades. Swiatek beat Annet Kontaveit to win the Qatar Open.

                          Chris Stapleton won the trophy for Male Vocalist of the Year at the 2022 CMA Awards, beating out
                          fellow nominees Eric Church, Luke Combs, Cody Johnson and Morgan Wallen. Visibly moved by the win,

                          singer had a hot streak as Male Vocalist, but Combs toppled his reign for two years in 2019 and
                          2020. Still, in 2022, Stapleton's steady traditionalism and consistency as a live act won the day.
                          Together with his All-American Road Show, the singer has been one of country music's most prolific
                          and reliable touring acts this year, and he is even the subject of a current Country Music Hall of

                          By Jonas Pope IV The suspense surrounding the rare UNC-N.C. State ACC baseball title game matchup
                          ended when Vance Honeycutt’s first home run landed on West 4th Street. When his second home run
                          landed in almost the same spot, it was celebration time for the Tar Heels, sadness for the
                          Wolfpack. North Carolina defeated N.C. State, 9-5, to win the 2022 ACC tournament title Sunday, the
                          eighth title in school history and first for the Tar Heels since 2019. Carolina won three straight
                          ACC tournament titles from 1982-84 and won it again in 1990 before adding championships in 2007 and
                          2019. Scott Forbes, the Tar Heels’ second-year skipper, won a championship in his first attempt.
                          The title still eludes N.C. State head coach Elliott Avent, in his 26th season. “ACC champs,”
                          Forbes said, tossing his hands in the air. “Our whole approach was we wanted to win an ACC
                          championship for the University of North Carolina, we just happened to be playing N.C. State.” N.C.
                          State hasn’t won an ACC title since 1992. They are 0-8 in title games since then. Sunday’s showdown
                          was the first time since 1990 that the Tar Heels and Wolfpack played in a title game. Carolina won
                          that contest, 5-0.

  - Answer              : A16 Bionic chip
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          Earlier this week, Qualcomm announced its latest Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 mobile chip and platform,
                          promising to "revolutionize flagship smartphones" with "groundbreaking" experiences. The new chip
                          is expected to launch in flagship Android smartphones later this year, but benchmarks suggest it
                          cannot compete with Apple's A16 Bionic chip, which powers iPhone 14 Pro models. While the latest
                          chip won't officially ship in smartphones for a few months, Geekbench scores for the chip have
                          already been spotted in an unreleased Android handset. According to the results (via DealNTech),
                          the latest Snapdragon 8 chip scored 1483 in single-core and 4709 in multi-core. The A16 Bionic
                          scored 1874 in single-core and 5372 in multi-core. For comparison, the A15 Bionic chip, found in
                          the iPhone 13 Pro and the lower-end iPhone 14 models, also scored higher than Qualcomm's latest
                          chip with 1709 in single-core compared to 1483. In a press release for the new chip, Qualcomm said
                          it will "define a new standard for connected computing, intelligently engineered with
                          groundbreaking AI across the board to enable extraordinary experiences." Qualcomm's senior vice
                          president and general manager of mobile handsets, Chris Patrick, said, "Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 will
                          revolutionize the landscape of flagship smartphones in 2023.

                          front-facing camera also has autofocus for the first time.[30] The cameras use Apple's latest
                          computational photography engine, called Smart HDR 4. Users can also choose from a range of
                          photographic styles during capture, including rich contrast, vibrant, warm, and cool. Apple
                          clarifies this is different from a filter because it works intelligently with the image processing
                          algorithm during capture to apply local adjustments to an image, and the effects will be baked into
                          the photos, unlike filters which can be removed after applying.[6] The camera app contains
                          Cinematic Mode, which allows users to rack focus between subjects and create (simulate) shallow
                          depth of field using software algorithms. It is supported on wide and front-facing cameras in 4K at
                          30 fps.[6] The iPhone 14 is equipped with slightly longer battery life compared to the iPhone 13.
                          According to Apple, the iPhone 14 (3,279 mAh) can provide up to 20 hours of video playback,[31] 16
                          hours of streaming video playback, and 80 hours of audio playback.

                          Earlier this week, Qualcomm announced its latest Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 mobile chip and platform,
                          promising to "revolutionize flagship smartphones" with "groundbreaking" experiences. The new chip
                          is expected to launch in flagship Android smartphones later this year, but benchmarks suggest it
                          cannot compete with Apple's A16 Bionic chip, which powers iPhone 14 Pro models. While the latest
                          chip won't officially ship in smartphones for a few months, Geekbench scores for the chip have
                          already been spotted in an unreleased Android handset. According to the results (via DealNTech),
                          the latest Snapdragon 8 chip scored 1483 in single-core and 4709 in multi-core. The A16 Bionic
                          scored 1874 in single-core and 5372 in multi-core. For comparison, the A15 Bionic chip, found in
                          the iPhone 13 Pro and the lower-end iPhone 14 models, also scored higher than Qualcomm's latest
                          chip with 1709 in single-core compared to 1483. In a press release for the new chip, Qualcomm said
                          it will "define a new standard for connected computing, intelligently engineered with
                          groundbreaking AI across the board to enable extraordinary experiences." Qualcomm's senior vice
                          president and general manager of mobile handsets, Chris Patrick, said, "Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 will
                          revolutionize the landscape of flagship smartphones in 2023.

                          JAY-Zand director Jeymes Samuel are teaming up again. Six months after the release of their Netflix
                          show-stopper The Harder They Fall, on Thursday, it was announced that the two are collaborating on
                          a film adaption of graphic comics Irredeemable and its spinoff Incorruptible. Directed by Samuel
                          with co-production from Hov and James Lassiter, Kemp Powers, whose credits include 2021 Disney+
                          film Soul and Marvel Studios upcoming Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, will write the script.
                          Boom! Studios’ Stephen Christy and Ross Richie will also assist as co-producers. The Irredeemable
                          graphic series dramatizes how The Plutonian, the world's greatest hero, snapped and became a
                          supervillain. In the comic's sister series Incorruptible, supervillain Max Damage responds to
                          Plutonian's evil by transforming into a superhero. In a statement, Netflix briefly explained the
                          synopsis of the upcoming film. "Protagonists from each series – one a villain on a quest to become
                          a superhero, and the other a fallen hero turned villain – face off." Originating from comic book
                          publisher Boom! Studios, the series was created by author Mark Waid with illustration from Peter
                          Krause. Krause spoke with Deadline about the upcoming Netflix adaptation.

                          Adam McKay has been attached to direct “Irredeemable” for 20th Century Fox, TheWrap has learned.
                          The film is based on the Boom! Comics book of the same name and would help kick off Fox’s brand-new
                          superhero cinematic universe. The “Anchorman” and “Big Short” director will be working with Tommy
                          Wirkola (“Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters”), who is writing the screenplay. In the comics,
                          “Irredeemable” follows superhero-turned-villain, the Plutonian, as he goes on a killing rampage.
                          It’s up to the superhero group The Paradigm to stop him.

                          actor Leslie Grace, Michael Keaton and Brendan Fraser will not be released at all, Warner Bros
                          Discovery has unexpectedly announced, despite shooting already being completed and the film being
                          in post-production. Directed by Ms Marvel directors Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah, the film was
                          initially greenlit in 2021 as part of a wider move at Warner Bros to create feature films
                          specifically for the streaming service HBO Max. But the studio confirmed on Tuesday that the film
                          would never get any release, either theatrically or on HBO Max. It declined to provide further
                          comment. Batgirl was to have Keaton reprise his role as Batman, alongside Grace as the titular hero
                          Barbara Gordon, JK Simmons as Barbara’s father, Commissioner Gordon, and Fraser as the villain
                          Firefly. The Hollywood Reporter said Batgirl’s budget was a factor in the decision, having risen to
                          nearly $90m (£74.1m, A$130m) due to costs relating to it being shot during the Covid-19 pandemic.
                          While the budget is lower than the average DC superhero film, it was reportedly decided that it did
                          not have the “spectacle that audiences have come to expect from DC fare” and would not recoup its
                          losses from being released.

                          bond: They’re play-date parents. On a lively Zoom call with their “Lost City” co-star Daniel

                          without thinking they’re going to die.” In “The Lost City” (in theaters March 25), Bullock plays
                          romance novelist Loretta Sage, whose life is on autopilot until she’s kidnapped by a rich eccentric
                          (Radcliffe) who believes she can lead him to a hidden treasure buried deep in the jungle.

Question 42              : When did Apple M2 chip?
Correct Answers         :  
                          June 6, Jun 6, Jun. 6, 6 June, 6 Jun, 6 Jun.

                          When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it
                          works. The M2 chip is here, ushering in the second generation of Apple's bespoke silicon The Apple
                          M2 chip was unveiled at Apple's WWDC 2022 keynote on June 6, and it's the inaugural chip in Apple's
                          second generation of bespoke silicon. This is significant because the M2 is an evolution of the
                          remarkable M1 chip that debuted in 2020, and it powers Apple's new 13-inch MacBook Air 2022 and
                          MacBook Pro 2022. These are successors to two of the best MacBooks on the market, so it's exciting
                          to see what an M2 injection can do. The new Apple M2 chip debuted in two new laptops: the 13-inch
                          MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, which launched in the Summer of 2022. The M2 chip is available in
                          either the 13-inch MacBook Air 2022 (starting price: $1,199) or the MacBook Pro 2022 ($1,299), so
                          you'll need to pay over $1k to get yourself an M2-powered MacBook. It's also available in the Mac
                          mini M2, a cheaper and more powerful version of Apple's pint-sized Mac. Apple's new M2 chip is
                          configurable with an 8-core CPU and up to a 10-core GPU.

                          Apple in June 2022 unveiled the M2, its next-generation Apple silicon chip that followed the M1
                          chip. This guide highlights everything you need to know about the M2 chip, from performance
                          improvements to extra features. The M2 is Apple's next-generation System on a Chip (SoC) developed
                          for use in Macs and iPads. It marks Apple's continued work to transition away from the Intel chips
                          that were used in Macs up until 2020. As a "System on a Chip," the M2 integrates several different
                          components, including the CPU, GPU, unified memory architecture (RAM), Neural Engine, Secure
                          Enclave, SSD controller, image signal processor, encode/decode engines, Thunderbolt controller with
                          USB 4 support, and more, all of which power the different features in the Mac. Before Apple
                          silicon, Macs used multiple chips for CPU, I/O, and security, but Apple's effort to integrate these
                          chips is the reason why the M2 is much faster and more efficient than Intel chips. The unified
                          memory architecture that Apple has included is also a major factor because all of the technologies
                          in the M2 are able to access the same data without having to swap between multiple pools of memory.
                          Built into the M2 chip, the unified memory architecture means the CPU, GPU, and other processor
                          components don't need to copy data between one another, and are able to access the same data pool.

                          lovers are already expecting the 2023 Academy Awards to be a star-studded affair. The Academy of
                          Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced in May 2022 that the 95th annual Oscars would be held
                          the following March, returning to Hollywood’s iconic Dolby Theatre. Six months later, Jimmy Kimmel
                          was confirmed as the 2023 host. “Being invited to host the Oscars for a third time is either a
                          great honor or a trap. Either way, I am grateful to the Academy for asking me so quickly after
                          everyone good said no,” the comedian teased in a November 2022 statement. Academy CEO Bill Kramer
                          and president Janet Yang called Kimmel “the perfect host,” while ABC exec Craig Erwich praised the
                          Brooklyn native’s poise under pressure. “Having Jimmy Kimmel return to host the Oscars is a dream
                          come true. As we see every night on his own show, Jimmy can handle anything with both heart and
                          humor, and we know that he will deliver the laughs and celebratory moments that define the Oscars,”
                          Erwich continued.

                          April 2 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) on Sunday posted record quarterly vehicle deliveries, but
                          quarter-on-quarter sales growth was modest despite price cuts as rising competition and a bleak
                          economic outlook weighed. Tesla delivered 422,875 vehicles for the first three months of this year,
                          up 4% from the previous quarter. This was 36% higher than a year ago. In January, Chief Executive
                          Elon Musk said Tesla could achieve 2 million vehicle deliveries this year, up 52% from last year.
                          Investors have been watching Musk's gamble that cutting prices would stimulate sales, although they
                          worry about eroding margins. In January, Tesla slashed prices globally by as much as 20%,
                          unleashing a price war after missing Wall Street delivery estimates for 2022. The basic Model Y
                          that used to sell for $65,990 now costs $54,990. "If they wouldn't have done the price cut, it
                          would have been ugly. I think what it tells you is the economy is getting tough," Gene Munster,
                          managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, said on Sunday. "They showed an acceleration, but
                          they didn't accelerate to the level that Elon had suggested it would." Musk, who has missed his own
                          ambitious sales targets for Tesla in recent years, said in January that 2023 deliveries could hit 2
                          million vehicles, absent external disruption, from 1.3 million in 2022.

                          million vehicles, absent external disruption, from 1.3 million in 2022.

                          the service. Mr. Musk’s open approach to speech on Twitter could exacerbate long simmering issues
                          of toxic content and misinformation, affecting political debates around the world.

                          At least one of the executives who was fired was escorted out of Twitter’s office, they said. Mr.
                          Musk, who is one of Twitter’s most active users and has more than 109 million followers, began
                          accumulating shares in the company this year. In April, he struck the deal to buy the company for
                          $44 billion and said he would lift Twitter’s content moderation policies, eliminate spam, add new
                          features and provide more transparency about the algorithms used to promote content. “Twitter has
                          tremendous potential — I look forward to working with the company and the community of users to
                          unlock it,” he said in a statement in April. But, within weeks, he began questioning the deal. Mr.
                          Musk lashed out at the Twitter executives responsible for content decisions and accused the company
                          of failing to accurately count the spam accounts on its platform. When Parag Agrawal, Twitter’s
                          chief executive, tried debunking Mr. Musk’s claims, Mr. Musk responded by tweeting a poop emoji. By
                          July, Mr. Musk had decided that he no longer wanted to own Twitter, arguing that he had been misled
                          about the amount of spam on the platform. He announced his intent to abandon the acquisition.
                          Twitter sued Mr. Musk to force him to carry out the agreement. The company accused Mr. Musk of
                          trying to back out of the deal because the economic downturn had caused a decline in his personal
                          wealth. Mr. Musk had agreed to personally provide roughly $33 billion of the $44 billion deal.

                          stake. Twitter invited Musk to join its board of directors, an offer he initially accepted before
                          declining. On April 14, Musk made an unsolicited offer to purchase the company, to which Twitter's
                          board initially responded with a "poison pill" strategy to resist a hostile takeover, before
                          unanimously accepting Musk's buyout offer of $44 billion on April 25. Musk stated that he planned

                          accounts, and promote free speech. In July, Musk announced his intention to terminate the

                          Scottie Scheffler won the 2022 Masters on Sunday following a dominant performance at Augusta
                          National. The world No. 1 finished ahead of Northern Irishman Rory McIlroy to claim his first major
                          title. After two close-range misses on the 18th green, he rolled home the winning putt and carded a
                          final round one-under par 71 to finish on 10-under for the tournament, three shots ahead of
                          second-placed McIlroy. Over the four days at the lush, sprawling golf club in Augusta, Georgia,
                          Scheffler produced some excellent golf, refusing to falter under the pressure of being the
                          tournament’s leader for nearly three days. In the end, he was rewarded for his recent run of good
                          form, winning the most prestigious tournament title out there, as well as going home with the
                          famous green jacket and the $2.7 million winners purse. Asked how he felt in the immediate
                          aftermath, Scheffler said he was “pretty tired.” “I want to go home! I’m pretty tired right now –
                          I’m really at a loss for words right now,” he said. “I can’t thank my family enough – they’ve made
                          many sacrifices over the years. To have the honor of winning the tournament and to have my family
                          with me was incredible.” The last two months have been transformative for Scheffler.

                          Over the next several hours, Scheffler, 25, rebuffed every challenge with the same aplomb to claim
                          his first major championship, running away to win the 2022 Masters by three strokes. His margin of
                          victory would have been larger but for a final show of some nerves during the tournament’s closing
                          sequence on the 18th green, when Scheffler needed four putts, including three from less than five
                          feet, to close out a round of 71. Scheffler finished 10 under par for the tournament, in just his
                          third Masters appearance. Rory McIlroy, who trailed Scheffler by 10 strokes heading into the final
                          round, finished second after an eight-under-par 64. Smith and Shane Lowry tied for third, five
                          strokes off the lead. Speaking with reporters after donning the ceremonial green jacket awarded to
                          Masters winners, Scheffler talked of feeling calm on the course during the final round but said he
                          was “so stressed out” on Sunday morning. “I cried like a baby,” he said. “I was so overwhelmed.”
                          Scheffler added that he told his wife, Meredith, “I don’t think I’m ready for this.” Scheffler said
                          he could not recall any previous episodes of self-doubt and attributed it to an understanding of
                          how much winning the Masters would mean to him. “I’ve felt at peace on the golf course,” he said,
                          laughing.

                          how much winning the Masters would mean to him. “I’ve felt at peace on the golf course,” he said,

                          Ashleigh Barty defeated Danielle Collins in the final, 6–3, 7–6(7–2) to win the women's singles
                          tennis title at the 2022 Australian Open. She became the first home player to win an Australian
                          Open singles title since Chris O'Neil in 1978. It was Barty's third major singles title, and she
                          won the title without losing a set, dropping just three service games during the tournament.[1] The
                          final also marked Barty's last professional appearance, as she announced her retirement from the
                          sport two months later.[2] Naomi Osaka was the defending champion,[3] but lost to Amanda Anisimova
                          in the third round.[4] Barty retained the world No. 1 singles ranking after Aryna Sabalenka and
                          Barbora Krejčíková lost in the fourth round and quarterfinals, respectively. Collins entered the
                          WTA top 10 rankings for the first time by reaching the final.[5] Alizé Cornet reached her first
                          major singles quarterfinal on her 63rd main-draw appearance, surpassing Tamarine Tanasugarn's
                          all-time record, who reached her maiden quarterfinal at the 2008 Wimbledon Championships on her
                          45th attempt.[6] Kaia Kanepi becomes the first Estonian to reach the quarterfinals at all four
                          majors after her victory over second seed Aryna Sabalenka in the fourth round.

                          double-faults, had to pay off eventually. Just had to. And so, as she wasted a second match point
                          by flubbing a forehand, and a third by again missing another, Sabalenka did her best to stay calm,
                          something she used to find quite difficult. She hung in there until a fourth chance to close out
                          Elena Rybakina presented itself — and this time, Sabalenka saw a forehand from her similarly
                          powerful foe sail long. That was that. The championship belonged to Sabalenka via a 4-6, 6-3, 6-4
                          comeback victory over Wimbledon winner Rybakina. “The last game, yeah, of course, I was a little
                          bit nervous. I (kept) telling myself, like, ’Nobody tells you that it’s going to be easy.’ You just
                          have to work for it, work for it, ’til the last point,” said Sabalenka, a 24-year-old from Belarus
                          who is now 11-0 with two titles in 2023 and will rise to No. 2 in the WTA rankings on Monday. “I’m
                          super happy that I was able to handle all those emotions,” she said, “and win this one.” The only
                          set she has dropped all season was the opener on Saturday against Rybakina, who eliminated No.

                          singles tennis title at the 2022 Australian Open.[1] It was his second Australian Open title and

                          excellent start on the court at Rod Laver Arena he knows so well.

                          route, in the fourth round to Zheng Qinwen. With the win, Świątek extended her winning streak to 35
                          matches (dating back to the Qatar Open in February), equaling Venus Williams' tally from the 2000
                          season.[2] Świątek also became the youngest winner of multiple majors since Maria Sharapova in
                          2006.[3] Barbora Krejčíková was the defending champion,[4] but she lost in the first round to Diane
                          Parry. This marked only the third time in French Open history that the defending champion lost in
                          the first round (after Anastasia Myskina in 2005 and Jeļena Ostapenko in 2018), and the record
                          fifteenth consecutive unsuccessful French Open women's singles title defense since 2007.[5]
                          17-year-old Linda Nosková became the youngest qualifier to debut in the main draw since Michelle
                          Larcher de Brito in 2009.[6][7][8][9] This was the second time in the Open Era when only one out of
                          the top ten seeds advanced to the fourth round of a major, after 2018 Wimbledon.[10]

                          Had Alcaraz not dealt with cramping in his leg on Friday, it's worth wondering whether he would
                          have given Djokovic a better run for his money. The Spaniard is widely believed to be the next big
                          thing in men's tennis, and he already has one Grand Slam title to his name as a 20-year-old,
                          winning the 2022 U.S. Open by defeating Ruud. Alcaraz won the U.S. Open when he was just 19 years
                          old, becoming the first male player to win a Grand Slam as a teenager since Nadal accomplished the
                          feat at Roland Garros in 2005. Additionally, Alcaraz has won 10 ATP Tour men's singles titles,
                          which includes the 2022 U.S. Open and four Masters 1000 titles. Two of his Masters 1000 titles came
                          in the Madrid Open, while the others came in the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells and the Miami
                          Open. Alcaraz, who turned pro in 2018, is only just getting started, and tennis fans around the
                          globe are in for a treat once he hits his prime. Back in the French Open final for the second

                          became the first Kazakhstani[i] to win a major title, and the third player representing an Asian
                          nation to win a major title after Li Na and Naomi Osaka. She also became the first Kazakhstani to
                          progress past the quarterfinals of a major.[3] Rybakina was the first player to win from a set down
                          in the final since Amélie Mauresmo in 2006. Jabeur became the first Arab to reach a major singles
                          final, the first African woman to do so in the Open Era, and the first African woman to do so not
                          representing South Africa.[4][ii] This marked the first time since 2009 that both finalists
                          represented non-European nations. Ashleigh Barty was the reigning champion, but retired from
                          professional tennis in March 2022.[5] World No. 1 Iga Świątek's win streak of 37 matches (dating to

                          (AP) — Marketa Vondrousova came to the All England Club a year ago unable to play tennis at all.
                          She had a cast on her surgically repaired left wrist, so her visit was limited to sightseeing
                          around London with her sister and cheering for a friend who was competing at Wimbledon. This trip
                          was a lot more memorable: She is leaving as a Grand Slam champion. Vondrousova became the first
                          unseeded woman to win Wimbledon on Saturday, coming back in each set for a 6-4, 6-4 victory over
                          2022 runner-up Ons Jabeur in the final.

                          Three-time defending champion Novak Djokovic defeated Nick Kyrgios in the final, 4–6, 6–3, 6–4,
                          7–6(7–3) to win the gentlemen's singles tennis title at the 2022 Wimbledon Championships. It was
                          his seventh Wimbledon title and 21st major singles title overall.[1] Djokovic became the fifth man
                          in the Open Era to record a streak of at least four consecutive titles at one major.[2] By reaching
                          his 32nd men's singles major final, he surpassed the all-time record he had jointly held with Roger
                          Federer.[3] Djokovic also became the first player (male or female) to win 80 matches at all four
                          majors with his first-round win over Kwon Soon-woo.[4] Because no ranking points were awarded for
                          the tournament in response to its banning of Russian and Belarusian players, Djokovic dropped out
                          of the top five in ATP rankings after the tournament.[5] Kyrgios became the first unseeded man to
                          reach a major final since Jo-Wilfried Tsonga at the 2008 Australian Open, the first Australian man
                          to reach a major final since Lleyton Hewitt at the 2005 Australian Open, and the first unseeded or
                          Australian man to reach the Wimbledon final since Mark Philippoussis in 2003.[6]

                          when she lost to Emma Raducanu in the second round. Her game, though, built on touch, slice and
                          angles rather than power, is a good fit for grass, making this victory slightly less unexpected
                          than at first glance. She credits an early coach and her slightness of stature for the way her game
                          has developed, saying: 'I had one coach in my home town who taught me how to slice and everything.
                          'I just feel like I was always the smallest one and I just didn't have that much power, so I had to

                          very strong hug and enjoy the moment, Champion!!' Djokovic said after the match: 'Not so good for
                          me, but good for Carlos. Praises to Carlos. You deserve it absolutely, congratulations. 'As for me
                          obviously, you never like to lose matches like this. But when all the emotions are settled I have
                          to still be very very grateful. 'Maybe I have won a couple of finals I should have lost. So maybe
                          this is 'even Stevens!' 'It is a tough one to swallow when you are so close. I lost to a better
                          player, I have to congratulate him, and move on - stronger hopefully.' The victory means that he is
                          the first person outside of the 'big four' - Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Andy
                          Murray - to win the Wimbledon men's single title since 2002, when Alcaraz wasn't even born. It is
                          his second grand slam title after winning the US Open in 2022. The last time 36-year-old Djokovic
                          lost on centre court, in 2013 to Andy Murray, Carlos was still in primary school. Share what you

                          at the Champions Dinner. Ms Vondrousova's best run at Wimbledon prior to this year had been in 2021
                          when she lost to Emma Raducanu in the second round. Her game, though, built on touch, slice and
                          angles rather than power, is a good fit for grass, making this victory slightly less unexpected
                          than at first glance. She credits an early coach and her slightness of stature for the way her game
                          has developed, saying: 'I had one coach in my home town who taught me how to slice and everything.
                          'I just feel like I was always the smallest one and I just didn't have that much power, so I had to
                          do something else to win. You can use it really well and you have many options, so that's a great

                          fourth and final grand slam of the year. World No1 Iga Swiatek won the women's title at the 2022 US
                          Open tennis grand slam on Saturday (10 September), defeating Ons Jabeur 6-2, 7-6 [7-5]. With her
                          victory at Flushing Meadows in New York, the fourth and final grand slam of the year, Swiatek
                          claimed her third Grand Slam trophy after she won the 2020 and 2022 French Open. The Polish
                          superstar raced to a dominant first-set win on the hard courts of the USTA Billie Jean King
                          National Tennis Center. However, Jabeur made things complicated for the 21-year-old in a marathon
                          second set. The title, which Great Britain's Emma Raducanu won in 2021, was the first time a No1

                          Carlos Alcaraz (ESP) will take on Casper Ruud (NOR). Swiatek became the first woman to win seven
                          titles in one year since Serena Williams in 2014. "You have to be mentally strong throughout the
                          whole tournament," Swiatek told ESPN. "It wasn't easy. I know I didn't play perfectly. Sometimes
                          you have to accept that.

                          64 BLACKSBURG, Va. — Amid the excitement and fanfare of a new head coach comes an uncomfortable
                          side of things too. The previous regime at Virginia Tech wasn’t cutting it, nor were some of the
                          players. It’s how a program once revered for its consistent ability to win 10 games a year finishes
                          under .500 in three of the past four seasons. Advertisement So for new Hokies head coach Brent Pry,
                          chief among his tasks is to be open and honest with players about where they fit in the new world
                          order, what their role is and, in some cases, whether he thinks they’re good enough to play at
                          Virginia Tech. “We can’t be afraid of hard conversations,” Pry said. “Everybody in here has
                          weaknesses, including myself. It’s about staring at those head-on and addressing them and let’s go
                          work through them and strengthen them.” In that spirit, here’s a hard conversation for Hokies fans:
                          This season could be a rough one. That’s not a commentary on Pry’s long-term viability as Tech’s
                          coach. The early returns seem positive, with Pry saying and doing all the right things and sowing
                          the seeds with how he and his staff are re-establishing themselves in the state on the recruiting
                          trail after many of those relationships atrophied in the Justin Fuente era. But this roster isn’t
                          in a quick-fix situation.

                          In college, I once proposed a hilarious—albeit deranged—sociology study. Imagine if you could take
                          someone who didn’t know anything about American sports and put them in a place where the only
                          access they had to the outside world was ESPN’s First Take back when Stephen A. Smith and Skip
                          Bayless were on it. After a year, you take said person and ask them about sports. Their
                          understanding of sports would be, err, interesting. The Consensus operates somewhat like that, but
                          for Best of cigar lists. Imagine you knew someone who didn’t smoke cigars but saw all of the Top
                          25/Top 10/etc. lists put out by various genres of cigar media. They’d also need an incredible
                          memory and decent addition/subtraction skills. Their understanding of what the best cigars of the
                          year would be based not on their own experience, but rather, on the lists produced by various cigar
                          media. And imagine if they took the lists at basically equal value. That’s The Consensus, though
                          it’s a spreadsheet, not a person. I started this concept more than a decade ago with the goal of
                          trying to see if there was a commonality within cigar media. I never really aimed to figure out
                          what the best cigar of the year was—after all, I could tell you my personal favorite—but I wanted
                          to see what the collective cigar media had to say.

                          The 2022 Kentucky Derby (officially, the 148th Running of the Kentucky Derby Presented by Woodford
                          Reserve[1]) took place on Saturday, May 7, 2022, at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky. It was
                          the 148th running of the Kentucky Derby, a 1+1⁄4 miles (2.0 km) Grade I stakes race for
                          three-year-old Thoroughbreds. The Derby is held annually at Churchill Downs on the first Saturday
                          in May since its inception in 1875. The 20 horses that ran in the Derby qualified by earning points
                          in the 2022 Road to the Kentucky Derby. The two favorites for the 2022 Kentucky Derby were
                          Epicenter, the winner of the Louisiana Derby, and Zandon, the winner of the Blue Grass Stakes. Both
                          horses finished behind winner Rich Strike, who had only entered the race after a late scratch.
                          Entering the race at odds of 80–1, Rich Strike's victory was the second-largest upset in Derby
                          history. It was the first Kentucky Derby victory for his trainer Eric Reed, as well as the first
                          graded stakes win in any race for his jockey Sonny Leon. Participation in the Kentucky Derby is
                          restricted to three-year-old Thoroughbreds.

                          Kentucky. Zandon, leaving from the 10 post, opened as the 3-1 morning-line favorite after Derby
                          post positions were released Monday, followed closely by Epicenter at 7-2 from the third position.
                          Post time for Saturday's one and one-quarter mile race is 6:57 p.m. ET. In last year's edition of
                          the Run for the Roses, Medina Spirit crossed the finish line first, which appeared to have given
                          trainer Bob Baffert a record seventh win in the race and jockey John Velazquez his fourth Derby
                          win. However, the horse tested positive for a banned race-day substance and the Kentucky Horse
                          Racing Commission stripped Medina Spirit of his Derby title in February. With Medina Spirit's win

                          The initial months of 2021 were not favorable for automakers. Semiconductor shortages derailed the
                          post-COVID recovery, affecting vehicle sales worldwide. But the shortages have eased a bit one year
                          later and auto sales are reviving. Automakers expect to recover the losses made during the last two
                          years, soon. However, traditional automakers are unable to cope with the rising demand for pure
                          EVs, whereas Tesla’s ability to address this demand has rewarded it not only with higher vehicle
                          sales in Q1 2022 but also a record revenue of $18.8 billion. Tesla has also started deliveries to
                          car rental service provider Hertz against its huge 100,000-vehicle order, which is also a reason
                          for high vehicle production and delivery during the quarter. Tesla’s Q1 2022 revenue would have
                          been more without the fresh COVID wave that has hit Shanghai and surrounding areas, affecting the
                          company’s production there. From the second week of March, rising cases of a new COVID variant have
                          forced automakers operating around Shanghai to suspend production. The urge to achieve L4 autonomy
                          by the end of 2023 and to roll out robotaxis by early 2025 can be a major reason for Tesla’s big
                          R&D spend. Besides, Tesla could also be conducting research on developing new battery chemistry.
                          The soaring prices of some key battery components like nickel and lithium have put the auto OEMs in
                          a spot.

                          been more without the fresh COVID wave that has hit Shanghai and surrounding areas, affecting the
                          company’s production there. From the second week of March, rising cases of a new COVID variant have
                          forced automakers operating around Shanghai to suspend production. The urge to achieve L4 autonomy
                          by the end of 2023 and to roll out robotaxis by early 2025 can be a major reason for Tesla’s big
                          R&D spend. Besides, Tesla could also be conducting research on developing new battery chemistry.
                          The soaring prices of some key battery components like nickel and lithium have put the auto OEMs in
                          a spot.

                          STX Entertainment is an American entertainment and media company. Founded in March 2014 by film
                          producer Robert Simonds, the studio produces film, television, and digital media projects. In April
                          2020, STX announced that it would merge with the Indian studio Eros International plc. The merger
                          was completed in July 2020, and STX became a division of ErosSTX. In December 2021, Jahm Najafi
                          announced his intention to acquire STX from the merged company for $173 million–a sale completed in
                          April 2022. Eros remains a minority, non-voting shareholder.[1] In 2012, Simonds and McGlashan
                          began work on conceptualizing a media company based on the idea of producing medium-budget projects
                          with a star attached, a method that had gone out of style with Hollywood studios. The conversation
                          led to the launch of STX Entertainment in 2014, with the mission to finance, develop, produce,
                          market, and distribute star-driven content around the world.[2][3] Investors in the company
                          included Hony Capital, Tencent, PCCW, TPG Growth, and Liberty Global. Individual investors include
                          Gigi Pritzker, Beau Wrigley, and Dominic Ng.[4][5][6] In September 2017, it was reported that STX
                          was considering an initial public offering on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (SEHK).

                          Orrin Grant Hatch (March 22, 1934 – April 23, 2022) was an American attorney and politician who
                          served as a United States senator from Utah from 1977 to 2019. Hatch's 42-year Senate tenure made
                          him the longest-serving Republican U.S. senator in history, overtaking Ted Stevens, until Chuck
                          Grassley surpassed him in 2023. Hatch chaired the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and
                          Pensions from 1981 to 1987. He served as chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee from 1995 to 2001
                          and 2003 to 2005. On January 3, 2015, after the 114th United States Congress was sworn in, he
                          became president pro tempore of the Senate. He was chair of the Senate Finance Committee from 2015
                          to 2019, and led efforts to pass the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Orrin Grant Hatch was born in
                          Homestead, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Pittsburgh.[1][2] He was the son of Jesse Hatch (1904–1992), a
                          metal lather,[3] and his wife Helen Frances Hatch (née Kamm; 1906–1995). Hatch had eight brothers

                          This article was published more than 1 year ago Orrin G. Hatch, a conservative Utah Republican who
                          came out of political nowhere to win a U.S. Senate seat in 1976 and ended his career 42 years later
                          as the longest-serving Republican in the chamber’s history and one of his party’s most influential
                          lawmakers of recent decades, died April 23 in Salt Lake City. He was 88. The death was announced by
                          the Hatch Foundation. The cause was not immediately disclosed. Tall and slim in build and
                          impeccable in dress, Mr. Hatch had a gentlemanly demeanor but behind it wielded strong views, high
                          energy and a love for legislative give-and-take that made him a force on Capitol Hill. When he
                          retired in 2019, at the end of his seventh term, he chaired the powerful tax-writing Finance
                          Committee and by virtue of his seniority was Senate president pro tempore. By the end of his
                          tenure, Mr. Hatch had sponsored or co-sponsored 790 pieces of legislation that became law, more
                          than any other senator in office at the time, according to Library of Congress data. He achieved
                          that record in part through his willingness to work with liberal Democrats. “He was a tough
                          partisan, a solid conservative, but he could make strategic alliances to get legislation passed,”
                          former Senate historian Donald Ritchie said in an interview. “No one questioned his ideology, so he
                          could deal.

Question 75              : Who was the new CEO of CNN?

                          Jump to Warner Bros. Discovery should not hire a new CEO for CNN. Chris Licht's exit from that role
                          gives WBD an opportunity to rethink what kind of leadership the organization really needs, and CEO
                          David Zaslav should grab it. You know who wasn't CEO of CNN? Jeff Zucker, the network's boss for
                          nine years. Zucker's title was president of CNN Worldwide. He was also chairman of WarnerMedia News
                          & Sports, but that's not the role he was known for. And while there are plenty of criticisms to
                          make of his tenure — the firehose coverage of Trump, ratings challenges, the undisclosed consensual
                          relationship with a colleague that precipitated his exit — Zucker was a strong, dynamic general who
                          held the hearts and minds of CNN's newsroom. Without a CEO title. Insider recently published an org
                          chart highlighting the most powerful executives at WBD — it reveals that there are nine people with
                          a CEO title reporting to Zaslav. Nine. A CEO runs a company. WBD is a sprawling global
                          entertainment conglomerate with many complex divisions, but it is not a holding company with nine
                          subsidiaries each requiring its own chief executive. Zaslav is the chief executive of all of those
                          divisions, especially CNN, where he reportedly was very involved with day-to-day operations, even
                          though the network represents less than 10% of WBD revenue, The Wall Street Journal reported.

  - Source              :
                          Discovery head of streaming JB Perrette and now-CNN Chief Operating Officer David Leavy, were
                          skeptical of spending hundreds of millions of dollars on niche or half-baked content ideas like
                          "Jake Tapper's Book Club" and "Parental Guidance with Anderson Cooper." Leavy is now part of the
                          executive team that will help Zaslav find a new CEO. Zaslav thought CNN+ was a waste of resources
                          for a company saddled with $50 billion of debt that needed to boost free cash flow and generate $3
                          billion in merger-related synergies. But before he made any decisions, he wanted to hear Licht's
                          thoughts. Licht was supposed to begin his job May 2, 2022, but he started a few weeks early to
                          weigh in on CNN+. In several virtual conferences, he met with CNN+ head Andrew Morse, CNN+ general
                          manager Alex MacCallum and CNN Chief Tech Officer Robyn Peterson, according to people familiar with
                          the matter who declined to be identified due to the private nature of the talks. Perrette and
                          Discovery streaming CFO Neil Chugani (who would become CNN's CFO) were also there. Licht expressed
                          his skepticism with the product's programming, according to people in the meeting. The discussion
                          centered around the viability of offering a product named after CNN without actually featuring a
                          live feed of the network's cable programming. Perrette told the CNN+ leadership to pause all
                          marketing spending and not to launch on Roku.

                          “We have a lot to do and the war in Ukraine reminds us that we are going through tragic times where
                          France must make its voice heard,” Macron said. During her campaign, Le Pen pledged to dilute
                          French ties with the 27-nation EU, NATO and Germany, moves that would have shaken Europe’s security
                          architecture as the continent deals with its worst conflict since World War II. Le Pen also spoke
                          against EU sanctions on Russian energy supplies and faced scrutiny during the campaign over her
                          previous friendliness with the Kremlin. A chorus of European leaders hailed Macron’s victory, since
                          France has played a leading role in international efforts to punish Russia with sanctions and is
                          supplying weapons to Ukraine. “Democracy wins, Europe wins,” said Spanish Prime Minister Pedro
                          Sánchez. “Together we will make France and Europe advance,” tweeted European Commission President
                          Ursula von der Leyen. Italian Premier Mario Draghi called Macron’s victory “splendid news for all
                          of Europe” and a boost to the EU “being a protagonist in the greatest challenges of our times,
                          starting with the war in Ukraine.” Macron won with 58.5% of the vote to Le Pen’s 41.5% —
                          significantly closer than when they first faced off in 2017. Macron is the first French president
                          in 20 years to win reelection, since incumbent Jacques Chirac trounced Le Pen’s father in 2002.

                          The iPhone 14 Pro's lens on the main rear camera also has a wider field of view than the 13 Pro's:
                          24mm versus 26mm. This means you can get a little more in your shot, which might be especially
                          helpful for landscape photography. The iPhone 14 Pro also has another trick up its sleeve: The
                          48-megapixel sensor can also take 12-megapixel shots at an effective 2x optical zoom. You'll see a
                          new 2x option in the camera interface. That crops the center of the higher-resolution image to
                          immediately give you more flexibility with focal length, without needing a fourth lens. The iPhone
                          13 Pro can also take photos at 2x zoom, but it uses digital zoom and doesn't have the same quality
                          or level of detail as this new technique. I find the new 2x option on the iPhone 14 Pro helps with
                          portrait mode. Instead of just offering 1x and 3x options like on the older phone, it can also snap
                          portrait mode photos at 2x. This results in more natural-looking shots to my eye. I find it's more
                          flattering on facial features than the wide look from 1x, or the zoomed-in perspective at 3x. The

                          Taiyab said he applauded Apple for trying to empower iPhone owners but had a harsh verdict. “They
                          set up the customer to fail,” he said. The self-repair program, I concluded, is impractical for
                          most people. For starters, the cost of renting the equipment and purchasing parts from Apple — $96
                          to replace my iPhone 12’s battery — was more than the $69 an Apple store charges to do the job. And
                          as my experience shows, the process was challenging even with Apple’s tools. Apple discourages most
                          people from trying self-repair. “For the vast majority of customers, the safest and most reliable
                          repair is achieved through an Apple Store” and thousands of authorized repair centers, the company
                          said in a white paper last month. “Repairing modern electronic devices that are complex, highly
                          integrated and miniaturized isn’t easy.” This raises the question of why Apple rolled out the
                          self-repair program in the first place. It is probably no coincidence that it made the move after
                          the Federal Trade Commission said last year that it would ramp up enforcement against tech
                          companies that made it hard for people to fix their electronics. And now, my tale of defeat. I
                          started by visiting Apple’s self-repair program website, selfservicerepair.com. There I found the

                          I’m just betting on Durant until I see anything to suggest I shouldn’t. Lambre: Gimme Lakers and
                          Nets. The Lakers have the easiest road to reaching the Finals because of bad injury luck to teams
                          like the Clippers and Nuggets. The Nets will, by season’s end, be the most talented team in the
                          East and will therefore vanquish all challengers come playoff time. Mahoney: Brooklyn outlasts an
                          improved, more streamlined Milwaukee team to make it out of the East, in part because Irving took
                          leave from his post as a voice for the voiceless, got his shots, and joined the team midseason. The
                          absolute chaos of the West winds up working in the favor of the steadiest team in the conference:
                          the Phoenix Suns, who play with a similar polish but more pop owed to the further development of
                          their young core. Murdock: Lakers-Nets. Assuming everyone’s healthy, these are the two best teams
                          in the league. And, more importantly, it’s what everyone wants. Make it happen, NBA. Verrier: Nets
                          and Lakers. The 2021 Finals was the first without either KD or LeBron in a decade. I wouldn’t bet
                          on that happening again this year. Check your inbox for a welcome email. Oops. Something went

Question 82              : What is the prize money for the Squid Game-inspired reality competition?
Correct Answers         :  
                          4.56 million
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - Source              :
                          When news of the reality competition spin-off was announced last week, some on social media pointed
                          out the irony of such a competition show. “The game is intended to represent the commodification of
                          suffering by privileged people, and how watching people struggle for money and their lives is seen
                          as entertainment for people who will never have to experience such things,” said Mika Winder, 16,
                          of Oregon. “Making a real life version goes against the entire message of the original show in an
                          almost comical way." Others echoed similar sentiments on social media, including one person who
                          tweeted: “Did Netflix even watch the show? Did they glean any meaning from it?” Netflix and
                          production firms Studio Lambert and The Garden, the show’s co-producers, did not respond to request
                          for comment. The reality show will feature 456 English-speaking players from around the world who
                          will compete for a cash prize of $4.56 million, Netflix said. Details of what the games will entail
                          were not revealed in Netflix's press release or the show's casting application. For some fans of
                          "Squid Game," like Dracy Peters, the reality competition series is an opportunity to "have fun."
                          Peters, 23, of Louisiana, said he's applying to be a contestant to put his knowledge of the games
                          to the test. “The show is a work of fiction with an elaborate plot, where the characters had to
                          risk their lives for the money,” Peters said.

                          Netflix is recruiting participants for a reality TV show inspired by its most popular series of all
                          time, Squid Game. However, it will not be life or death that is at stake, as depicted in the South
                          Korean dystopian drama. Instead, 456 recruits from around the world will play games where "the
                          worst fate is going home empty-handed" - missing out on a $4.56m (£3.8m) prize. Netflix also
                          confirmed that the popular series would be renewed for a second season earlier this week. On
                          Wednesday, the platform announced that its new 10-episode series - Squid Game: The Challenge -
                          would offer the "largest cast and lump cash prize in reality TV history". "As [players] compete
                          through a series of games inspired by the original show - plus surprising new additions - their
                          strategies, alliances, and character will be put to the test while competitors are eliminated
                          around them," it added. Participants need to be at least 21 years old. They must speak English, and
                          be available for up to 4 weeks in early 2023 for filming. The 456 participants are a nod to the
                          fictional series, which features the same number of players, with its main protagonist Seong Gi-hun
                          also referred to as Player 456. The South Korean thriller series tells the story of debt-ridden
                          people competing for a huge cash prize in a deadly series of children's games.

                          When news of the reality competition spin-off was announced last week, some on social media pointed
                          out the irony of such a competition show. “The game is intended to represent the commodification of
                          suffering by privileged people, and how watching people struggle for money and their lives is seen
                          as entertainment for people who will never have to experience such things,” said Mika Winder, 16,
                          of Oregon. “Making a real life version goes against the entire message of the original show in an
                          almost comical way." Others echoed similar sentiments on social media, including one person who
                          tweeted: “Did Netflix even watch the show? Did they glean any meaning from it?” Netflix and
                          production firms Studio Lambert and The Garden, the show’s co-producers, did not respond to request
                          for comment. The reality show will feature 456 English-speaking players from around the world who
                          will compete for a cash prize of $4.56 million, Netflix said. Details of what the games will entail
                          were not revealed in Netflix's press release or the show's casting application. For some fans of
                          "Squid Game," like Dracy Peters, the reality competition series is an opportunity to "have fun."
                          Peters, 23, of Louisiana, said he's applying to be a contestant to put his knowledge of the games
                          to the test. “The show is a work of fiction with an elaborate plot, where the characters had to
                          risk their lives for the money,” Peters said.

                          These missions are only available as free-to-play game modes during specific seasons, but Blizzard
                          will offer to buy permanent access to these missions separately or as part of a battle pass
                          bundle.[11] Overwatch 2 was announced at BlizzCon on November 1, 2019, with plans that the game
                          would maintain a "shared multiplayer environment" between it and the original Overwatch, so that
                          players in either game could compete in the existing player versus player (PvP) game modes,
                          retaining all unlocked cosmetics and other features.[12] Jeff Kaplan, director for Overwatch,
                          explained that this was a major decision and that he had to justify this "player-first standpoint"
                          to Blizzard executives, given the current industry trend to draw in new sales.[13] All new heroes,
                          maps, and PvP modes were to be added to both games to maintain this shared environment.[14]
                          However, Overwatch 2 was later announced as a free-to-play title, and that on its release on
                          October 4, 2022, Blizzard affirmed that Overwatch 2 live services would replace those of the
                          original game; the original Overwatch servers would be shut down on October 2, 2022.[15] Players
                          retained their existing cosmetics and in-game currency, with remaining loot boxes opened
                          automatically upon the release of Overwatch 2.

                          Amazon said its cloud-computing division Amazon Web Services (AWS) posted 33 percent increase in
                          its revenue to $19.7 billion in the second quarter of 2022. AWS has generated operating income of
                          $5.71 billion in Q2. Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky said on an analyst call that a downturn in 2008
                          resulted in companies choosing to use Amazon’s cloud services rather than build their own data
                          centers, giving AWS a boost. Rival Microsoft said earlier this week that its fiscal-year revenue

                          Amazonâ€™s investor website. Analyst Take: Amazonâ€™s Q2 2022 results came in better than analysts
                          expected, which is a bright spot, especially considering the powerful macroeconomic headwinds and
                          unsteady world conditions that continue to affect Amazonâ€™s broad range of business units and
                          other companies in general. But Amazonâ€™s guidance for the rest of 2022 is even better, showing
                          that the company is above the fold for demand in a tougher macro environment.

                          The Xenoblade Chronicles 3 release date was on July 29, meaning the game is out now. That’s right,
                          go check it out! The story itself is new, and it “ties together the futures of the worlds depicted
                          in Xenoblade Chronicles and Xenoblade Chronicles 2.” There are two warring factions in the world of
                          Aionios – Keves and Agnus. The former is responsible for mechanical technology, while the latter
                          prefers magical tech. You can learn more in our Xenoblade Chronicles 3 colonies guide. When in
                          combat, you can battle with up to seven characters, and, much like in previous Xenoblade games, you
                          must directly face an enemy out in the field to engage in a fight. Naturally, each character brings
                          their own strengths to the battlefield, and this allows you to use a range of strategies. There is
                          also a new mechanic called interlinking, which you can learn more about in our Xenoblade Chronicles
                          3 Ouroboros guide. Furthermore, each character falls under a different class, and this only adds to
                          the diversity that the game gives you, which you can find out more about in our Xenoblade
                          Chronicles 3 classes guide. Nothing like switching between characters and classes to keep things
                          fresh. In Aionios, the world of #XenobladeChronicles3, there are two opposing nations: Keves and
                          Agnus.

                          Xenoblade Chronicles 3[b] is a 2022 action role-playing game developed by Monolith Soft and
                          published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch. It is an installment in the open-world Xenoblade
                          Chronicles series, itself a part of the larger Xeno franchise. Xenoblade Chronicles 3 depicts the
                          futures of the worlds featured in Xenoblade Chronicles (2010) and Xenoblade Chronicles 2 (2017) and
                          concludes the trilogy's narrative. The development team wanted to develop a story-driven game in
                          the style of the first two entries in the series, while featuring content and combat from previous
                          Xeno entries. The gameplay combines elements from the first and second entries. Like the first two
                          entries, the game was localized by Nintendo of Europe. Xenoblade Chronicles 3 takes place in
                          Aionios, where two warring nations, Keves and Agnus, engage in perpetual war fought by soldiers
                          with ten-year lifespans. The story follows Noah and his two childhood friends, Eunie and Lanz, who
                          are from Keves, and Mio and her two fellow servicemen, Sena and Taion, who are from Agnus. They
                          gain the power of Ouroboros and decide to cooperate to find safety. Through this journey, they
                          uncover the mystery behind the perpetual war and the true nature of their world.

                          awry in the sky in Jordan Peele’s latest visually and thematically ambitious film Nope. OJ (Daniel
                          Kaluuya) is the head wrangler of Heywood Hollywood Horses, an intergenerational, Black-owned and
                          now struggling ranch that specializes in training horses for the big screen. But it is his sister
                          Emerald (Keke Palmer) who notices that Ghost, one of their family’s veteran equine actors, is
                          unexpectedly standing in an outdoor pen staring out into space, his light grey fur as sublime as
                          the moonlight. Ghost jumps the fence and gallops away, saying “nope” in his own way. As a
                          subversive Western science fiction kaleidoscope, Nope challenges viewers to consider technology,
                          surveillance, other worldly life and the making of spectacle through different lenses — including
                          the eyes of animals. The result is an unsettling view that exposes core ethical questions about

                          the OPT-175B language model (which is 58x the size of Blender Bot 2), and has long-term memory. It
                          also eliminates the limitations such as forgetfulness (which surprisingly makes machine learning
                          models efficient when not used in chatbots). It has self-learning capabilities that allow it “to
                          improve its conversational skills and safety through feedback from people who chat with it,
                          focusing on helpful feedback while avoiding learning from unhelpful or dangerous responses.” Well,
                          yes and no. While it is entirely plausible that the underlying AI tech helps it to ‘learn,’ it
                          seems like Blender Bot 3 cannot differentiate between what is acceptable and what is not. At least
                          that’s what its recent responses to some people conveyed.

                          the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model is GPT-4.
                          There is a free version of ChatGPT that only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version,
                          ChatGPT Plus. Anyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies and search engines are utilizing

                          utilize ChatGPT, although others may limit the use of the AI-powered tool. Most recently, Microsoft
                          announced at it’s 2023 Build conference that it is integrating it ChatGPT-based Bing experience
                          into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startup Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT to produce

                          Rich visuals mean pictures for now, but later can include maps, charts and other items. ChatGPT’s
                          generative AI has had a longer lifespan and thus has been “learning” for a longer period of time
                          than Bard. A chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn’t
                          necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the
                          sense that they’ll give canned responses to questions. ChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM
                          technology to generate text after a prompt. Yes. Due to the nature of how these models work, they
                          don’t know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That’s a problem when you’re
                          using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn’t commit, that may
                          well at this point be libel. We will see how handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT will
                          play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving
                          target in the industry. Yes, there is now a free ChatGPT app that is currently limited to U.S. iOS

                          confirmed a new model that is set to replace GPT-3.5. Surprise surprise, it will be called GPT-4!
                          We are happy to announce that the wait is finally over! OpenAI officially launched this new model
                          on its website this week. And there’s no doubt about it – it is definitely something to get excited
                          about. So, since GPT-4 has arrived, what features will it have and how do you access it? Let’s have
                          a look at what GPT-4 can do. The first major feature we need to cover is its multimodal
                          capabilities. According to OpenAI, GPT-4 will be able to accept “image and text inputs, emitting
                          text outputs”. This new feature was also confirmed by Microsoft’s Germany CTO last week. But, what
                          is a multimodal model? Well, this refers to a model that can operate using multiple mediums such as
                          text, image, and sound. This technology could open up a wide range of opportunities for its users
                          and will completely revolutionize the way we interact with OpenAI-powered tools. So, what else can
                          we expect? Well, according to the developers, GPT-4 may be more similar to GPT-3.5 than we think.

                          By Susan Bradley, Contributing Writer, Computerworld | Windows 11 22H2, released two weeks ago, is
                          another step closer to being an acceptable upgrade to Windows 10. But many Windows users aren't yet
                          being offered it for download. It's important to understand that we're in the “seeker” era for
                          Windows 11 22H2. Microsoft still has a variety of hardware and third-party issues to work through,
                          which is why you might not get offered 22H2 right away. But there is a mechanism you can use to
                          review any hard blocks on your system. (If you want to get 22H2 sooner rather than later, you could
                          opt into the Insider release track, which ensures you get the beta versions of Windows 11 — but
                          that also exposes your hardware to possible bugs, side effects, and other issues.) Courtesy of Adam
                          Gross, you can use a GitHub script to determine exactly why your system is not being offered 22H2.
                          You can either download the PowerShell script from the Github site or follow these commands to
                          determine what might be blocking Windows 11 22H@ from showing up on your hardware.. First, search
                          for PowerShell and then right-mouse click and run as administrator. In an administrator PowerShell
                          session, type in the following: Install-Module FU.

Question 99              : When did AMD unveil Ryzen 7000 processors?

                          You won't have to wait much longer to learn more about AMD's Ryzen 7000 desktop processors. The
                          company has announced that it will unveil the new CPU line in a YouTube livestream on August 29th
                          at 7PM. The event will share more about the new Zen 4 architecture and the supporting AM5 platform.
                          There are already some clues as to what to expect. AMD inadvertently shared some of the first Ryzen
                          7000 model numbers on its website in July, including one Ryzen 5 chip (7600X), one Ryzen 7 variant
                          (7700X) and two Ryzen 9 releases (7900X and 7950X). As with past launches, the company appears
                          focused on gaming-friendly enthusiast CPUs while leaving budget parts for later releases. Zen 4 and
                          AM5, meanwhile, promise meaningful architectural changes. You'll see more Level 2 cache, boost
                          speeds beyond 5GHz, AI hardware acceleration and support for newer standards like DDR5 memory and
                          PCIe 5.0 expansion. AMD claimed a 15 percent boost to single-threaded performance in early testing.
                          Effectively, AMD is responding to Intel's 12th-gen Core — it's just a question of whether or not
                          Ryzen 7000 is fast enough to keep up or edge ahead.

                          self-driving” has increased again. This time to $15,000, making it an unusually expensive option
                          for a car. “After wide release of FSD Beta 10.69.2, price of FSD will rise to $15k in North America
                          on September 5,” Musk tweeted last month. The release of the new software version was delayed on
                          Monday until “probably end of week. Needs a bit more polish,” Musk said, but the price increase
                          took effect. Some Tesla owners who paid far less for an earlier, unfinished version of the same

                          beta and the overwhelming majority, 11 people, said they felt it wasn’t worth $15,000. These
                          drivers say the software has improved, but not enough to warrant the price. They describe at times
                          having to pay more attention while using “full self-driving” than when driving on their own, as the
                          car can be unpredictable. More than 100,000 Tesla vehicles have been sold with the feature.

                          begins about 100 years after the Seven Kingdoms are united by the Targaryen Conquest, nearly 200
                          years before the events of Game of Thrones, and 172 years before the birth of Daenerys Targaryen.
                          Featuring an ensemble cast, the show portrays the events leading up to the beginning of the decline
                          of House Targaryen, a devastating war of succession known as the "Dance of the Dragons". House of
                          the Dragon received a straight-to-series order in October 2019, with casting beginning in July 2020
                          and principal photography starting in April 2021 in the United Kingdom. The series premiered on
                          August 21, 2022, with the first season consisting of ten episodes. Five days after its premiere,
                          the series was renewed for a second season. Sapochnik departed as showrunner after the first
                          season, leaving Condal to serve as the sole showrunner for the second season.

                          The premiere of the “Game of Thrones“ prequel “House of the Dragon” on Sunday made history for HBO
                          and HBO Max and drew the largest audience for any new HBO original series, with 9.986 million
                          viewers across linear and streaming in the U.S. Warner Bros. Discovery announced the news on
                          Monday, citing that the premiere also marked the largest series launch on HBO Max across the United
                          States, Latin America and the EMEA region (Europe, the Middle East, and Africa). In the U.K., the
                          premiere pulled in 1.39 million viewers for Sky, a record for the Comcast-owned satellite TV
                          operator, according to The Hollywood Report. “House of the Dragon” has big shoes to fill as it is
                          the first spin-off in the “Game of Thrones” franchise. “Game of Thrones” is a crown jewel for HBO,
                          with its 82-minute series finale in 2019 getting 19.3 million viewers across linear viewing. Also,
                          the “Game of Thrones” series recently had its strongest week on HBO Max to date, the company noted
                          yesterday. This month, the weekly average of engagement for the series is almost 50% above July and
                          nearly 90% higher than in June. While the premiere’s success is a win for HBO Max, analysts and
                          investors will likely keep a close eye on the new series. It is important that audience metrics
                          continue the momentum over the course of the 10-episode series, especially since the new Warner
                          Bros.

                          Ewers has more raw talent than 99% of college football quarterbacks, yet he may be in danger of
                          losing his starting job to freshman sensation Arch Manning. Both Manning and Ewing are big names to
                          keep an eye on in the Heisman odds market. Cade Klubnik, the Clemson quarterback, is currently
                          +1400 to win the Heisman Trophy. Klubnik finally took over for DJ Uiagalelei at the end of last
                          season, and Clemson’s offense seemed instantly more cohesive. If Klubnik can return the Clemson
                          offense to its one-time status as a playoff-caliber unit, he will have a firm place in the Heisman
                          discussion. A Klubnik Heisman win would be historic for the Tigers, as no Clemson player – not even
                          Deshaun Watson or Trevor Lawrence – has ever won the Heisman. Drake Maye, the North Carolina
                          quarterback, is currently +1600 to win the Heisman Trophy. Like Sam Howell before him, Maye put up
                          big numbers in Mack Brown’s UNC offense in 2022. As a result, he earned a handful of Heisman votes.
                          North Carolina may have hit its ceiling last year, reaching the ACC championship game before losing
                          to Clemson, 38-10. Maye wasn’t even a Heisman finalist. Given how last year unfolded, it’s fair to
                          wonder what the path to the top spot is for Maye.

Question 108              : Who is the chairman of Toulouse and under whose ownership are they currently?

                          20 Toulouse are newly restored to the French top flight. A club that appeared to be sinking without
                          a trace as French domestic football shut down prematurely, paralysed by the pandemic, in the spring
                          of 2020 is enjoying a renaissance on and off the pitch under American ownership and the
                          chairmanship of Damien Comolli. Advertisement Philippe Montanier’s side, the youngest and least
                          experienced team in the division, are still unbeaten after their first three matches and attacking
                          life at the higher level with all the vim and vigour which saw them establish records for
                          goalscoring while claiming Ligue 2 last term. The Athletic was invited to spend time behind the
                          scenes at a club reborn, talking to those who have instigated the upturn in fortunes and others who
                          have embraced it. The first of two articles, Rising from the Ashes, detailed the story of that
                          revival following the purchase of “Le TeFeCe” by RedBird Capital Partners, a United States-based
                          investment fund valued at over $6billion (£5.1bn), a little over two years ago. The second looks at
                          the innovative techniques Toulouse have implemented, and the sporting partnerships they are
                          forging, as they seek to maintain momentum and re-establish themselves at the top level. Theirs is
                          a bold approach, on and off the pitch.

                          November 15, 2022 at 7:52AM PST Netflix is making a BioShock movie with The Hunger Games director
                          Francis Lawrence lined up to shoot the film. Michael Green, who wrote Blade Runner 2042, is penning
                          the script. But how is the film coming along and what do the key creatives have in store? Lawrence
                          said in an interview with Collider that the BioShock video game series is both visually and
                          thematically appealing, which makes it a natural fit for a film. "There's real ideas and
                          philosophies underneath the game property, and it's really, really, really thought out. A lot of
                          games may have a great world of some kind, or they may have a great lead character, or they may tee
                          you up for great set-pieces, but they don't really have the ideas, they don't have the kind of
                          weight and the gravitas that Bioshock does," Lawrence said. You need a javascript enabled browser

Question 112              : Who won the World Cup Final in 2022?

                          Mbappe’s efforts in the final, and throughout the tournament, would have usually been enough to
                          coast to triumph but Messi’s magic proved to be too much. The Golden Boot provides a consolation
                          for the young Frenchman but, understandably, he was less than impressed to be forced into posing
                          with the trophy. His hat-trick in the final — the first since 1966 — brought his 2022 World Cup
                          tally to eight goals, one more than club team-mate Messi. Mbappe now has 12 goals at World Cup
                          finals, leaving him just four behind the all-time leading goalscorer Miroslav Klose. It feels like
                          2026, with its expanded format, will be the year that he smashes that record to pieces. For now,
                          the 23-year-old won’t be particularly excited by picking up one of football’s great individual

                          hammered home his authority as the best goalkeeper at a tournament and picked up the Golden Glove
                          in Qatar. He was the star of two penalty shootouts — including the biggest of them all — as
                          Argentina got their hands on the trophy.

                          World Cup appearance as he secured his third title in Brazil’s swashbuckling victory over Italy.
                          Four years later in Munich, host West Germany came from behind to win 2-1 against a star-studded
                          Netherlands team – made up of Johan Cruyff and Johan Neeskens – to win its second World Cup. Much
                          like Messi at Qatar 2022, Diego Maradona almost single-handedly drove his team to its second title
                          in eight years, beating West Germany 3-2 in the final. In 1998, France hosted and won its first
                          World Cup, mainly down to the genius of Zinedine Zidane, who scored twice in the final, to beat a
                          formidable Brazil side, composed of Ronaldo, Rivaldo, Cafu, Bebeto and Roberto Carlos. However,

Question 116              : Who acquired a stake in FromSoftware?

                          Sony, Tencent

                          Filed under: Deal injects roughly $260 million into the studio Tencent Holdings and Sony have
                          teamed up to acquire a nearly one-third stake in Elden Ring developer FromSoftware, the studio’s
                          parent company announced on Wednesday. The deal means a Tencent subsidiary owns 16.25% of
                          FromSoftware’s shares, while Sony Interactive Entertainment owns 14.09%. The rest is owned by
                          FromSoftware parent Kadokawa Corporation. Shanghai-based Tencent is the world’s largest video game
                          vendor, owing largely to its dominance within China’s vast market. It’s also well known for taking
                          significant positions in — if not buying outright — big-name publishers and developers outside of
                          China. Related Tencent fully acquired League of Legends maker Riot Games at the end of 2015;
                          Norwegian MMO house Funcom at the beginning of 2020, a roughly 40% stake in Epic Games in 2012; and
                          it is the majority shareholder in gaming companies like Supercell (Clash of Clans), Fatshark
                          (Warhammer: Vermintide 2), and Tequila Works (Deadlight, Rime). Tencent also bought 5 percent of
                          Activision Blizzard in 2013 (freeing that company from Vivendi Universal), but those shares will be
                          purchased by Microsoft in its $68.7 billion bid for the Call of Duty publisher. Sony’s investment
                          reflects its ongoing effort to acquire or strengthen ties to studios well known for making
                          PlayStation games.

                          match since telling the world she is ready to leave professional tennis. Greeted by a standing
                          ovation, the 23-time Grand Slam champion didn't smile. She didn't wave. She took a sip from a
                          plastic bottle as she walked in. Some folks in the crowd captured the moment with the cameras on

                          "Queen'' or "Thank you.'' No one knows exactly how many more matches Williams will play before she

                          ceded the spotlight. "A lot of emotions, obviously,'' Williams told spectators who offered her
                          encouragement throughout the clear, 75-degree evening. The second-round match at the hard-court
                          tuneup for the US Open came a day after she announced "the countdown has begun'' on her playing

                          said in a statement released by the school. "Working for Coach Beamer and Coach Foster as a
                          graduate assistant in the 1990s, I was privileged to have been a part of this program as the Hokies
                          established themselves as a national power, consistently proving they could beat anyone in the
                          nation. "Even after I departed Blacksburg, I always continued to appreciate Virginia Tech, its
                          great players, its championship teams, and its wonderful traditions from afar. The resources,
                          facilities, university backing of Athletics, and phenomenal fan support that Virginia Tech enjoys
                          made this a very desirable situation.

                          was arrested Wednesday on suspicion of strangulation and third-degree domestic assault. Police went
                          to a Lincoln residence in the afternoon after a report of a domestic disturbance. Following an
                          investigation, the 54-year-old Joseph was arrested at another location. He was being held at
                          Lancaster Country Jail. “While the Lincoln Police Department does not normally provide a news
                          release for a domestic-related arrest, due to the high-profile nature of the person involved and,

                          with Joseph about the job before Rhule’s hiring. Rhule had not announced whether Joseph would be

                          night. Joseph was a quarterback for the Cornhuskers from 1988-91 and had run-ins with police during
                          his playing days. He was arrested in September 1990 on suspicion of criminal mischief for allegedly
                          breaking an exterior window and damaging an inner window while trying to enter his girlfriend’s
                          apartment. According to police reports, the girlfriend’s roommate told officers there had been a
                          domestic dispute going on for several hours before the incident occurred.

  - Source              :
                          It's time to rethink who's at the top of the Big Tech food-chain, Constellation Research Principal
                          Analyst & Founder Ray Wang told Yahoo Finance Live (video above). Wang argued that MATANA —
                          Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Tesla (TSLA), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Nvidia (NVDA), and Amazon
                          (AMZN) – is an upgrade to FAANG by dropping Meta (META) and Netflix (NFLX) while adding Microsoft,
                          Tesla, and Nvidia. In 2013, when Jim Cramer of CNBC's "Mad Money" coined the term FAANG, many of
                          those companies were thought of as upstarts who'd taken their respective markets by storm. This was
                          especially true of Meta — then Facebook — and Netflix. But now, Wang said, both should be
                          re-assessed. Meta, in particular, needs a new plan. "Facebook has got to do something besides ads,"
                          he told Yahoo Finance. "Once again, they're taking a beating for it. So, is it going to be the

                          Program at the Emmys with Arcane picking up the award at the Creative Arts ceremony. It marks the
                          first time that a streaming show has picked up the award. It beat Bob’s Burgers, Rick and Morty,
                          The Simpsons and Chadwick Boseman-voiced What If…? in the hotly contested category. Other streaming
                          contenders in the past have included Netflix’s Big Mouth and BoJack Horseman. Arcane co-creator
                          Christian Linke picked up the award. “Thank you this. It’s a big deal for us as we come from video
                          games. It’s been amazing to see the world embrace our characters and our stories so thanks to

                          that takes you on a journey through time and space. The show follows the adventures of Fry, a pizza
                          delivery boy who was cryogenically frozen in 1999 and wakes up 1000 years later. He joins the crew

                          dangerous situations. What makes Futurama stand out is its perfect blend of science fiction and
                          comedy. The show's writing is clever, with jokes that will make you laugh and references that will
                          make any sci-fi fan giddy. The animation is also top-notch, with incredible attention to detail and

                          two Emmys for Outstanding Animated Program. The characters are loveable and relatable, with their
                          own unique quirks and personalities.

                          Leonard Glenn Francis, a former defense contractor and convicted mastermind of a
                          multimillion-dollar U.S. Navy corruption case who fled custody from home detention Sunday morning,
                          just weeks before he was to be sentenced to federal prison. Francis, a Malaysian national and the
                          former president of Singapore-based Glenn Defense Marine Asia, was convicted in 2015 after taking a
                          plea deal in exchange for helping U.S. prosecutors implicate three-dozen military officials. Since
                          at least 2018, he has been living in home detention in San Diego under court-approved “medical
                          furloughs” for treatment of renal cancer and other health issues, according to federal court
                          documents. He was scheduled to be sentenced on Sept. 22 before District Court Judge Janis
                          Sammartino. But at about 7:30 a.m. Sunday, the GPS tracker affixed to Francis’ ankle alerted
                          federal monitors that it “was being tampered with,” a U.S. Marshals Service official told USNI
                          News. That alert prompted monitors with U.S. Pretrial Services to check on his status, which, per
                          protocols, means ruling out scenarios including a faulty tracker. That agency handles all federal
                          defendants on pretrial or pre-sentencing release. “They just can’t assume somebody is on the run
                          and call U.S. Marshals,” said Supervisory Deputy U.S. Marshal Omar Castillo, with the U.S.

                          The most important Metaverse event of the year is coming up. What new products and announcements
                          can we expect at Meta Connect 2022? Meta Connect will once again take place in digital format and
                          will be streamed via Facebook on October 11 from 7 p.m. CEST / 1 p.m. EST. The keynote will be
                          followed by a live virtual reality talk by John Carmack. There will also be numerous pre-recorded
                          developer sessions in video form. You can find the most interesting presentations and discussions
                          in the Meta Connect 2 program. Let's move on to the announcements and products that Meta might
                          present at the event. Content At last year's Meta Connect, Meta teased a standalone premium headset
                          codenamed Project Cambria. Since the packaging leaked, we know that the product will be called Meta
                          Quest Pro. Mark Zuckerberg confirmed that the headset will be unveiled at Meta Connect 2022 and
                          that Quest Pro will go on sale before the end of October. Meta Quest Pro is a new product line that
                          focuses on work and productivity as well as virtual meetings and is aimed at enterprises,
                          professionals, and developers. The headset offers new, forward-thinking hardware features from
                          Meta's research labs. In the case of the first Meta Quest Pro, these include custom-made pancake
                          lenses, a high-quality passthrough mode, eye and face tracking, and self-tracking VR controllers.

                          VR games can then be streamed to the Meta Quest 2 via Air Link without a router or network setup.
                          Meta and D-Link are expected to announce the price and release date of the accessory at Meta
                          Connect 2022. The "VR Air Bridge" was developed in cooperation with Meta. | Image: D-Link It is
                          possible that Meta will also announce a native PC VR interface for Meta Quest 2 as part of this
                          initiative. Anyone who connects to a PC via Quest Link today is presented with the outdated Rift
                          user interface - not an optimal solution. Meta promised better PC-VR integration at Connect 2020,
                          but the plans remained lip service. The next big step toward high-end VR graphics is cloud
                          streaming. Meta is rumored to be testing its own VR streaming service called Avalanche, and Air
                          Bridge is expected to play a major role in those plans. The company could announce a closed beta
                          test or something similar at Meta Connect 2022. Augmented reality: will we see Meta’s first AR
                          headset? At last year's event, Zuckerberg teased Project Nazare: Meta's first AR headset. The
                          company only showed a brief simulation of what avatar holograms might look like through the AR
                          headset. According to a roadmap leak, three generations of the AR headset were scheduled for 2024,
                          2026, and 2028. But in June, it was said that the first version would no longer be commercialized
                          and would instead be distributed free of charge to developers.

                          Hardware Image: Mark Zuckerberg / Instagram Meta is likely to reveal more about the rumoured Meta
                          Quest Pro VR device at the annual Meta Connect showcase, taking place in October 2022. This headset
                          is set to be the next iteration of the popular VR device line, and is said to support mixed reality
                          experiences, while also having higher visual fidelity than its predecessors. The device, which may
                          actually be the mystery Meta device codenamed ‘Project Cambria’, will reportedly launch by the end
                          of 2022, and could be a more better-featured, more refined option when compared to the current Meta
                          Quest 2 device. It will also likely carry a more expensive price tag. In a recent episode of the
                          Joe Rogan Experience, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg appeared to enthuse about a ‘Quest Pro’ with
                          features including eye and facial tracking being discussed, as well as the ability to sync up a
                          digital avatar for more lifelike social interactions. Zuckerberg later teased the device in a post
                          on Meta. Read: New details confirmed for PlayStation VR 2, including ‘see-through view’ It’s
                          currently unclear how far along the rumoured Meta Quest Pro VR device is – but it’s likely we’ll
                          get a better glimpse when Meta Connect 2022 airs. This show will feature Meta’s vision for the
                          expanding ‘metaverse’ and will also introduce a number of innovations from leaders in the AR, VR
                          and XR spaces.

                          Gotham Knights is a 2022 action role-playing game developed by WB Games Montréal and published by
                          Warner Bros. Games. Inspired by the Batman: Gotham Knights comic series and based on the DC Comics
                          character Batman and his supporting cast, the game focuses on the characters Nightwing, Batgirl,
                          Robin, and Red Hood as they attempt to restore justice to Gotham City during a period of decline in
                          the immediate aftermath of Batman's death. While investigating the events that led to their
                          mentor's demise, the heroes become embroiled in an ancient conflict between two secret
                          organizations fighting for control of Gotham: the Court of Owls and the League of Shadows. Gameplay
                          is presented from the third-person perspective with a primary focus on using each playable
                          character's traversal and combat abilities to defeat enemies and explore the environment. Players
                          can freely move around Gotham City, interacting with characters, undertaking missions, and gaining
                          experience points and other resources to level up their characters and equipment. Outside of the
                          story, players are able to complete side missions to unlock additional content and collectible
                          items. A cooperative online multiplayer mode is also included, allowing two players to play through
                          the single-player campaign together while progressing in their own game. Gotham Knights was
                          released on October 21, 2022, for PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series X/S. Versions for the
                          PlayStation 4 and Xbox One were also planned, but were ultimately cancelled.

                          the best broadcast journalist I could be. In all the years of preparing to become an anchor, one of

                          George Bernard Shaw (26 July 1856 – 2 November 1950), known at his insistence as Bernard Shaw, was
                          an Irish playwright, critic, polemicist and political activist. His influence on Western theatre,
                          culture and politics extended from the 1880s to his death and beyond. He wrote more than sixty
                          plays, including major works such as Man and Superman (1902), Pygmalion (1913) and Saint Joan
                          (1923). With a range incorporating both contemporary satire and historical allegory, Shaw became
                          the leading dramatist of his generation, and in 1925 was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.
                          Born in Dublin, Shaw moved to London in 1876, where he struggled to establish himself as a writer
                          and novelist, and embarked on a rigorous process of self-education. By the mid-1880s he had become
                          a respected theatre and music critic. Following a political awakening, he joined the gradualist
                          Fabian Society and became its most prominent pamphleteer. Shaw had been writing plays for years
                          before his first public success, Arms and the Man in 1894. Influenced by Henrik Ibsen, he sought to
                          introduce a new realism into English-language drama, using his plays as vehicles to disseminate his
                          political, social and religious ideas.

                          On 8 September 2022, at 15:10 BST, Elizabeth II, Queen of the United Kingdom and the other
                          Commonwealth realms, and the longest-reigning British monarch, died at Balmoral Castle in
                          Aberdeenshire, Scotland, at the age of 96. Her death was publicly announced at 18:30. She was
                          succeeded by her eldest son, Charles III. The death of Queen Elizabeth II set in motion Operation
                          London Bridge, a collection of plans including arrangements for her state funeral, and supported by
                          Operation Unicorn, which set protocols for her death occurring in Scotland. The United Kingdom
                          observed a national mourning period of 10 days. The Queen's lying in state took place in
                          Westminster Hall from 14 to 19 September, during which time an estimated 250,000 people queued to
                          pay their respects. Elizabeth's state funeral on 19 September was the first held in Britain since
                          Winston Churchill's in 1965. A funeral service was held at Westminster Abbey, followed by a
                          procession to Wellington Arch that featured around 3,000 military personnel and was watched by
                          around a million people in central London. The state hearse then transported the Queen's coffin to
                          Windsor, followed by another procession through Windsor Great Park and a committal service at St
                          George's Chapel at Windsor Castle.

                          Elizabeth II (Elizabeth Alexandra Mary; 21 April 1926 – 8 September 2022) was Queen of the United
                          Kingdom and other Commonwealth realms from 6 February 1952 until her death in 2022. She was queen
                          regnant of 32 sovereign states over the course of her lifetime and remained the monarch of 15
                          realms by the time of her death. Her reign of over 70 years is the longest of any British monarch
                          and the longest verified reign of any female head of state in history. Elizabeth was born in
                          Mayfair, London, as the first child of the Duke and Duchess of York (later King George VI and Queen
                          Elizabeth The Queen Mother). Her father acceded to the throne in 1936 upon the abdication of his
                          brother Edward VIII, making the ten-year-old Princess Elizabeth the heir presumptive. She was
                          educated privately at home and began to undertake public duties during the Second World War,
                          serving in the Auxiliary Territorial Service. In November 1947, she married Philip Mountbatten, a
                          former prince of Greece and Denmark, and their marriage lasted 73 years until his death in 2021.
                          They had four children: Charles, Anne, Andrew, and Edward.

                          Alcaraz has broken his opponent's serve 39% of the time in the tournament and he also held his own
                          serve on 80% of occasions, an elite ratio. He is also elite at taking advantage of break point
                          chances, converting 46% on 0.85 per game compared to 39% on 0.57 per game for Tiafoe in the
                          tournament. Tiafoe is the first American man to make the US Open semifinal since 2006, and he
                          upended Rafael Nadal, a 22-time grand slam winner, earlier in the field. Tiafoe has the rest
                          advantage after Alcaraz played a five-hour marathon on Wednesday, and he dominated No. 9 seed
                          Andrey Rublev in the quarterfinal. Tiafoe has a 1-0 all-time edge against Alcaraz, and he is also
                          6-0 in tiebreakers during his US Open run. See who Calvert is backing here. Calvert has released
                          three strong bets, including a plus-money prop that returns almost 5-1. Be sure to check out
                          Calvert's picks and analysis before locking in your 2022 U.S. Open picks for the men's semifinals.
                          Who wins Tiafoe vs. Alcaraz in the 2022 U.S. Open men's semifinal? And what other pick could lead
                          to a big return?

                          Deutsch-USA TODAY Sports NEW YORK, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Carlos Alcaraz saved a match point in the
                          fourth set before digging deep in the decider to beat Jannik Sinner in a five-set thriller and
                          reach the U.S. Open semi-finals in the early hours of Thursday in New York. The Spanish teenager

                          the previous record for the latest finish of 2:26 a.m. set in three matches in 1993, 2012 and 2014.

                          and claiming the world number one ranking. "Honestly I still don't know how I did it," Alcaraz said
                          in an on-court interview. "The level that I played, the level of the match, the high quality of

                          LONDON (AP) — King Charles III was crowned Saturday at Westminster Abbey, in a ceremony steeped in
                          ancient ritual and brimming with bling at a time when the monarchy is striving to remain relevant
                          in a fractured modern Britain. Watch the ceremony in the video player above. At a coronation with
                          displays of royal power straight out of the Middle Ages, Charles was given an orb, a sword and
                          scepter and had the solid gold, bejeweled St. Edward’s Crown placed atop his head as he sat upon a
                          700-year-old oak chair. In front of world leaders, foreign royals, dignitaries and a smattering of
                          stars, the monarch declared, “I come not to be served but to serve,” and was presented as Britain’s
                          “undoubted king.” Inside the medieval abbey, trumpets sounded, and the congregation of more than
                          2,000 shouted “God save the king!” Outside, thousands of troops, hundreds of thousands of
                          spectators and scores of protesters converged. It was the culmination of a seven-decade journey for
                          the king from heir to monarch.

                          a collection of greatest hits and studio albums that have been certified by the Recording Industry
                          Association of America. He also has a host of Academy of Country Music Awards, in addition to
                          Grammy Award nominations. But the "You're Gonna Miss This" singer admitted he was a little
                          intimidated to work with legendary actress Susan Sarandon in their upcoming country music drama
                          about a dynasty of singers in "Monarch." Adkins portrays Albie Roman alongside Sarandon, who plays
                          Dottie Cantrell Roman, in the series, which is set to debut in September on FOX, and marks his
                          first starring role. He told Fox News Digital that working with Sarandon was "terrifying," but he
                          knew he was learning the ropes from a true icon. "It was terrifying at first, but then very quickly
                          I realized that she is so good, so professional, that she is going to carry the scene," Adkins
                          said. "You just try to hang on and make it to the buzzer, and she’ll take care of it. When asked

                          hadn’t used the Plus name since 2017, but it resurrected it in 2022 with the iPhone 14 Plus. Just
                          like before, the new model increases the screen size of the standard one, but keeps the majority of
                          the other technical features in place. It fits in that awkward space between the cheaper iPhone 14
                          and the slightly more expensive, but superior Pro model. But is there any real reason to buy it?
                          The iPhone 14 Plus is wider, taller, and heavier than the iPhone 14, and the only dimension that
                          stays the same is the thickness at 7.8mm. Made from aluminum and glass, it’s a step down in luxury
                          from the stainless steel and glass Pro models, but with this comes the advantage of low weight. At
                          203 grams, the iPhone 14 Plus can’t be called light, but it’s lighter than the iPhone 14 Pro and
                          only a few grams heavier than the Samsung Galaxy S22+. My usual iPhone of choice is the iPhone 14
                          Pro, and I’ve been consistently surprised at how light the iPhone 14 Plus feels when I pick it up,
                          despite the larger screen and body, as well as the scant 3-gram real-world difference between them.

                          The problem begins with Clemons. A film like Susie Searches demands a star turn, high voltage,
                          explosively quirky nerdery and histrionics. Think Flick, Nicole Kidman in To Die For, or either
                          lead in Agnieszka Smoczynska’s recent The Silent Twins. Clemons is mute, blank, inexpressive,
                          bored, taciturn, seeming even resentful of being there. Wolff clearly dislikes the type of zoomer
                          he’s portraying, delivering a good deal of his lines with embarrassed insecurity. The film is not a
                          failure in toto, but its failure to launch can only be credited to Kargman. The edit is the film’s
                          most disastrous component, frequently cutting away from critical reactions and lingering too long
                          on silence, stillness, and useless moments of transition. Kargman knew what type of movie she
                          wanted to make, and she more or less made one. All the parts are there, yet the intrepid detective
                          still struggles to understand how they connect. Little White Lies is committed to championing great

                          By Alex Zietlow Kyle Busch is moving from one storied racing team to another. The multi-time NASCAR
                          Cup Series champion will join Richard Childress Racing in 2023, according to a report from Jordan
                          Bianchi of The Athletic. The move ends a successful 15-year tenure with Joe Gibbs Racing. An
                          official announcement is expected Tuesday, per the report. The news punctuates an eventful and
                          “stressful” regular season for Busch, whose free agency dominated headlines and clouded a
                          playoff-caliber season in 2022. It did so because his looming free agency revealed a strange
                          reality in NASCAR economics — that one of the sport’s biggest stars would have to struggle to find
                          a home (even with taking a pay cut) because of something outside of his control. That “something”
                          outside of his control, in this case, was the result of the Mars Inc. decision to exit NASCAR at
                          the end of the year, leaving Joe Gibbs Racing (Busch’s current team) without a primary sponsor for
                          Busch’s No. 18 team. Busch confirmed to reporters earlier this month that he had “more than one”
                          team extend official contract offers to him. RCR was among those companies, per reports at the
                          time. He also said that his uncertain future had been weighing on him. “It weighs on you every
                          time, every day of the week,” Busch said at NASCAR’s playoff media day before the race at
                          Darlington.

                          His career average finish is 13.8, and no full-time RCR driver has reached that mark since Ryan
                          Newman in 2015. And on top of driving for RCR, his deal is also leading him to swap manufacturers
                          for Kyle Busch Motorsports in the Craftsman Truck Series. His team will be branded by Chevrolet in
                          2023, a major overhaul with Chase Purdy and Jack Wood joining the team. Fortunately for Busch, he
                          will not have to worry about finding sponsors at RCR. 3CHI, Alsco, BetMGM, Cheddars and Lenovo have
                          all confirmed they will sponsor the No. 8 car. And if anyone can bring back a championship trophy

                          The Pepperstone ATP rankings[1] are the Association of Tennis Professionals' (ATP) merit-based
                          system for determining the rankings in men's tennis. The top-ranked player is the player who, over
                          the previous 52 weeks, has garnered the most ranking points on the ATP Tour. Points are awarded
                          based on how far a player advances in tournaments and the category of those tournaments. The ATP
                          has used a computerized system for determining the rankings since August 23, 1973.[2] Starting in
                          1979, an updated rankings list is released at the beginning of each week. Since 1973, 28 players
                          have been ranked No. 1 by the ATP,[3][4] of which 17 have been year-end No. 1. The current world
                          number one is Carlos Alcaraz. Since the introduction of the rankings, the method used to calculate
                          a player's ranking points has changed several times. As of 2019, the rankings are calculated by
                          totaling the points a player wins in his best eighteen tournaments, subject to certain
                          restrictions. For top players the counting tournaments are the four Grand Slam tournaments, the
                          eight mandatory ATP Masters tournaments, the non-mandatory ATP Masters 1000 event in Monte-Carlo,
                          the player's best four eligible ATP Tour 500 tournaments and his best two results from ATP Tour 250
                          tournaments.

                          With the costume, my idea was that Albert Einstein was known to have multiple pairs of the same
                          trousers, shirts and coats because he did not want to muddle himself with things that he considered
                          to be trivial, like picking out clothing. He wasn’t concerned with that. It wasn’t his genius
                          saying, “I’m so smart. I don’t have time to pick up my clothing.” It was something that vexxed him.
                          So I said, I think Lex is the same. I think he has multiple black suits that he wears, multiple
                          black shirts and ties. That’s his thing. He doesn’t think about that. When he gets up, takes a
                          shower does his thing and goes in, and there’s no thought about it. But I wanted him to be really
                          kind of streamlined. I wanted him to look not like he’s slovenly, of “I’ve got 10 pairs of khakis
                          and a white shirt.” I’m simple, but I’m pressed because, for him, it’s also all about presentation.
                          I said, when this guy enters a room, he doesn’t move for anybody. So it was important to have that
                          silhouette. I thought also a lot about — and I spoke with the producers about this — parallels to
                          the character of Colonel Walter Kurtz who Marlon Brando plays in Apocalypse Now. I kept saying,
                          hey, when there are opportunities, maybe let’s not reveal Luthor physically right away.

Question 148              : How much did Google acquire Mandiant for?

                          GCN Mandiant, now officially owned by Google, has the scale (not to mention the deep pockets) to be
                          the "brain" across organizations' myriad security products and automate protection on top of these
                          controls, according to the security shop's CEO Kevin Mandia. Mandia spoke with reporters for the
                          first time about his threat-intel-slash-incident-response company's new owner during a press

                          component of the $5.4 billion deal, he said, is that Google will allow Mandiant to remain "controls

                          monitoring tools give telemetry, and firewalls give telemetry to the brain. One of the things we
                          can do best at Mandiant, combined with Google, is be that brain, be the hub for all the spokes."
                          Mandiant likes to position itself as one of the preeminent intelligence and incident response firms
                          that's called in by governments and major private organizations alike to clean up the mess after
                          really bad breaches. "We are the emergency room doctors when you need them most," Mandia boasted.

                          “Now it’s non-negotiable for any enterprise to have security and compliance as the number one
                          priority,” she said. “Companies just won’t have a seat at the table if they aren’t thinking about
                          security first because it’s a business imperative.” Experts agree: If Google wants to build out its
                          cloud business, tripling down on security is essential. "The enterprise is only as secure as its
                          least secure employee," said Ravichandran. The cybersecurity space is one that's generally been
                          deal-heavy, so looking ahead we'll likely see Big Tech, investors, and private companies strike
                          more deals in the sector, said Ravichandran. "Historically, we’ve seen fairly regular M&A in the
                          cybersecurity industry," he said. "In September alone, there were nearly 40 cybersecurity company
                          acquisitions, which signals that there is still a lot of opportunity when companies identify a
                          strategic fit." Rubin agrees, adding that these deals will grow even more important as
                          cybersecurity becomes an increasingly indispensable part of business strategies and outlooks. "The
                          Google and Mandiant deal is the latest in a string of high-profile, billion-dollar cybersecurity
                          acquisitions over the past few years, and it certainly won’t be the last," he told Yahoo Finance.
                          "If Google is willing to go 'all in' on cyber, clearly their customers believe security is core to
                          everything.

Question 149              : What was the inflation rate in the U.S. in August 2022?
Correct Answers         :  
                          8.3%
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prediction (only positive):
  - Answer              : 8.3%
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          Print U.S. consumer price increases eased in August compared to a year ago, the government said
                          Tuesday, but the drop was modest and may not be noticed much by financially squeezed American
                          households. The inflation rate was up at an annualized 8.3% rate in August, the Bureau of Labor
                          Statistics reported. The figure was down from the 8.5% mark recorded in July and the 9.1% inflation
                          rate in June, which was the biggest increase in four decades. Even as U.S. motorists have gladly
                          watched gasoline prices fall sharply in recent weeks — down 10.6% from their peak — costs for food
                          and apartment rentals have continued to increase. Overall, as a result, the government said that
                          consumer prices were up one-tenth of a percent in August, compared to July. Food prices were up 0.8
                          percent in the past month, while costs for housing, medical care, new cars and household
                          furnishings all increased in August compared to July. Stock investors in the United States remain
                          worried about inflation, with major indexes falling more than 2% at the opening of trading on
                          Tuesday, an hour after the release of the inflation report. President Joe Biden adopted a more
                          optimistic view, saying, "Overall, prices have been essentially flat in our country these last two
                          months. That is welcome news for American families, with more work still to do. "Gas prices are
                          down an average of $1.

                          works. The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is out now The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the
                          Kingdom is out now worldwide exclusively for the Nintendo Switch and, unsurprisingly, it's one of
                          the biggest and most exciting games available on the platform. Tears of the Kingdom is the sequel
                          to Breath of the Wild, which is widely considered to be one of the best Switch games ever and was
                          the console's biggest launch title. In other words, Tears of the Kingdom had some big shoes to
                          fill, and it ended up being even better! In our full near-perfect The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the
                          Kingdom review we said it: "leaps forward on what was offered in 2017’s Breath of the Wild, filling
                          out the world’s sandbox with innovative new tools and abilities, letting you approach challenges in
                          inventive new ways" The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom launched on May 12, 2023.
                          Unsurprisingly for a first-party Nintendo game, it's exclusive to the Nintendo Switch console
                          family. Tears of the Kingdom was initially due to release in 2022 but, in March of that year,
                          Nintendo pushed the date into 2023, with series producer, Eiji Aonuma, telling fans it was out of a
                          desire to "extend out development time a bit". The game is now available worldwide physically and
                          digitally.

                          In the years since its release, multiple games and developers have cited Breath of the Wild as an
                          inspiration. These include Genshin Impact,[200] Ghost of Tsushima,[201] Immortals Fenyx
                          Rising,[202] Telling Lies,[203] Halo Infinite,[204] Elden Ring,[205] and Forspoken.[206]
                          Similarities have also been noted between Breath of the Wild and other open-world games since its
                          launch, including Pokémon Legends: Arceus,[207] Sonic Frontiers [208][209] and Horizon Forbidden
                          West.[210] According to Digital Trends, Breath of the Wild has become a popular point of comparison
                          among open world games.[126] The game's success sparked increased interest in the Wii U emulator
                          Cemu, as the Cemu developers rapidly updated the software to run the game at a steady frame rate
                          within weeks of release.[211][212][213] The ability to run the game in an emulator led to a
                          thriving modding scene.[214] Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity, a hack and slash game in the style
                          of Dynasty Warriors series, following 2014's Hyrule Warriors, is a spin-off of Breath of the Wild,
                          with the story set 100 years before.[215] The game was released on November 20, 2020, on the

                          8][page needed] It was announced at E3 2019 as a sequel to Breath of the Wild.[9][10] At E3 2021,
                          Nintendo debuted a trailer revealing gameplay, story elements and a 2022 release window,[11] but
                          Nintendo later changed the release window to Q2 2023.[12][13] More information was revealed in the
                          Nintendo Direct presentation held in September 2022, including the title Tears of the Kingdom and a
                          release date of May 12, 2023.[14][15] Another Nintendo Direct in February 2023 teased more gameplay
                          elements.[16] A playable version of the game leaked online as a disk image two weeks before
                          release.[17][18] As with Breath of the Wild, Tears of the Kingdom was directed by Hidemaro
                          Fujibayashi and produced by Eiji Aonuma.[19] It was conceived after the team was unable to use
                          every idea planned for Breath of the Wild's downloadable content.[20] New elements include floating
                          islands above Hyrule, with players able to soar between them in a style similar to The Legend of
                          Zelda: Skyward Sword (2011).[21][22][23] While he was shown early demos, the involvement of the
                          Zelda creator, Shigeru Miyamoto, was reduced due to scheduling conflicts with his role as a
                          producer on The Super Mario Bros. Movie (2023).

                          out to find her – and to once again save Hyrule from one of its most prevalent threats. But oh!

                          (AP) — The United Kingdom and the world bade farewell to Queen Elizabeth II on Monday with a state
                          funeral that drew presidents and kings, princes and prime ministers — and crowds in the streets of
                          London and at Windsor Castle — to honor a monarch whose 70-year reign defined an age. In a country
                          known for pomp and pageantry, the first state funeral since Winston Churchill’s was filled with
                          spectacle: Before the service, a bell tolled 96 times — once a minute for each year of Elizabeth’s
                          life. Then, 142 Royal Navy sailors used ropes to draw the gun carriage carrying her flag-draped
                          coffin to Westminster Abbey, where pallbearers carried it inside and about 2,000 people ranging
                          from world leaders to health care workers gathered to mourn. The trappings of state and monarchy
                          abounded: The coffin was draped with the Royal Standard and atop it was the Imperial State Crown,
                          sparkling with almost 3,000 diamonds, and the sovereign’s orb and scepter. But the personal was
                          also present: The coffin was followed into the church by generations of Elizabeth’s descendants,
                          including King Charles III, heir to the throne Prince William and 9-year-old George, who is second
                          in line.

                          The hearse carrying Queen Elizabeth II's coffin stopped briefly as it arrived in the town of
                          Windsor, west of London, on Monday afternoon, so troops from the British Army's Grenadier Guards
                          could take their places flanking the vehicle for it's slow, final push to Windsor Castle. Once the

                          II's coffin made its way through west London toward Windsor. The standard always flies above any
                          royal castle or palace when the sovereign is there, so it being raised on Monday was a sign that
                          the late queen's son, King Charles III, had arrived at the royal residence ahead of the committal

                          George's Chapel, on the Windsor Castle grounds. Queen Elizabeth II made her final procession
                          through London on Monday after the state funeral service was held for her at Westminster Abbey.
                          Throughout the process, her coffin was heavily decorated in regalia, all representing various
                          aspects of the queen's life and legacy. Royal contributor Tina Brown told CBS News that the items
                          that draped and sat on top of the queen's coffin added historic symbolism to this "moving moment.

  - Source              :
                          The Queen was interred with her husband, Prince Philip, in the King George VI Memorial Chapel later
                          that evening, in a private service attended only by her closest family. The state funeral was the
                          largest security operation ever mounted in the UK, and included dignitaries from around the world.
                          The funeral was designated as a public holiday in the UK and several Commonwealth states. The state
                          funeral was one of the United Kingdom's most watched special television broadcasts, surpassing the
                          wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton, the previous most watched royal event of the
                          21st century. The period of official mourning and the funeral was estimated to have cost the
                          government £162 million.[1] Queen Elizabeth II was in good health for most of her life; her health,
                          however, declined significantly after the death of her husband, Prince Philip, in April 2021.[2]
                          She began to use a walking stick for public engagements in October 2021.[3] On 20 October, the
                          Queen stayed overnight in King Edward VII's Hospital in central London, necessitating the
                          cancellation of scheduled visits to Northern Ireland and the COP26 summit in Glasgow. She suffered
                          a sprained back in November, which prevented her from attending the 2021 National Service of
                          Remembrance.[4][5][6][7] In February 2022, during the COVID-19 pandemic in England, the Queen was
                          one of several people at Windsor Castle to test positive for COVID-19.

                          Digital Replica Edition Trending: Three people died Saturday morning when two airplanes collided
                          over Boulder County and crashed, according to the sheriff’s office. Just before 9 a.m., emergency
                          responders received calls about two planes colliding in midair east of Niwot, the sheriff’s office
                          said in a news release. Two separate crash sites were found. Claire Brown, 22, of Longmont, was
                          working Saturday morning, feeding horses at a stable off of 95th Street and Niwot Road, when she
                          heard a loud noise. Brown looked into the sky and saw to planes close together. “At first, it
                          looked like they were under control, then they spiraled down,” Brown said. “I saw some debris
                          flying in the air too, I figured they had hit each other.” Brown heard one plane crash. She called
                          a friend who resides close to the crash site, and he told her that he also heard the crash. In just
                          a moment, Brown said she heard sirens as responders raced to the scene. “It is definitely
                          unfortunate,” she said. “I knew those people were not alive after that. They weren’t terribly high,
                          but as they were spiraling down the nose of the plane was heading straight down, pointing straight
                          at the ground. You could tell that they had no control and that it was a bad crash. It happened so
                          fast.

                          Giorgia Meloni has been named Italy’s first female prime minister at the head of a right-wing
                          government, after holding talks with the country’s president. After a week of infighting which
                          overshadowed the negotiations, Meloni’s warring coalition put forward a united front, backing
                          Meloni to lead the country during formal talks with President Sergio Mattarella, on Friday. Later
                          on Friday Mattarella asked Meloni to form a government. Meloni, after arriving for talks in a Fiat
                          500, accepted unconditionally, a spokesman for the president’s office said. The right-wing
                          coalition emerged triumphant from the election, with 44 percent of the vote, led by Meloni’s
                          Brothers of Italy party, which took 26 percent. But even before a government could be cobbled
                          together, rivalry emerged inside the coalition, with allies arguing over Meloni’s unwillingness to
                          accommodate Silvio Berlusconi’s preferred nominations in her cabinet. At the opening of the new

                          The 80th Golden Globe Awards honored the best in film and American television of 2022, as chosen by
                          the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA). The ceremony was held on January 10, 2023, from The
                          Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California, produced by Dick Clark Productions and the HFPA, and
                          aired live in the United States on NBC and streamed on Peacock.[1][4][5][6][7] Jerrod Carmichael
                          hosted the ceremony.[2] The nominees were announced on December 12, 2022.[1][8][9] Father-daughter
                          duo George and Mayan Lopez were scheduled to announce the nominations together, but the former
                          dropped out after testing positive for COVID-19; he was replaced by Selenis Leyva.[10][11][12]
                          Eddie Murphy and Ryan Murphy were announced as the recipients of the Cecil B. DeMille Award[13] and
                          Carol Burnett Award,[14] respectively. The Banshees of Inisherin received a leading eight
                          nominations, including Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy and Best Director (Martin McDonagh),
                          the most achieved by any film since Cold Mountain in 2004; it also, alongside ABC's first-year
                          mockumentary comedy Abbott Elementary, won the most awards of the night with three wins.[9][15][16]
                          The ceremony also marked Lisa Marie Presley's last public appearance before her death two days
                          later on January 12, 2023.

                          The organization unveiled further plans for reform in May—promising to diversify and proposing
                          restrictions on the gifts its voters can accept—but Netflix, Amazon Studios, and WarnerMedia all
                          announced that they’d boycott the HFPA until there was more meaningful change. On May 10, NBC
                          released a statement saying it would not be airing the 2022 Golden Globes. “We continue to believe
                          that the HFPA is committed to meaningful reform,” it read. “However, change of this magnitude takes
                          time and work, and we feel strongly that the HFPA needs time to do it right. Assuming the
                          organization executes on its plan, we are hopeful we will be in a position to air the show in
                          January 2023.” Yes, but not in the usual format. On January 4, 2022, Variety reported that the HFPA
                          had failed to secure any celebrity presenters for the upcoming ceremony. Hours later, the outlet
                          revealed that the 2022 Golden Globes would be “very stripped down [and] will center on announcing
                          this year’s winners while also focusing on the HFPA’s philanthropy work. There will not be an
                          audience, only select HFPA members and philanthropy grantees will be in the room. There will be no
                          red carpet and media credential requests for the event will not be accepted.

                          Planning and producing the Golden Globes ceremony annually will remain a focus, too. Earlier this
                          year, the HFPA disclosed that the voting body for the 2024 competition will be comprised of 310
                          journalists from outside the US, a group which will include the organization’s 95 current members.
                          In a statement, Dick Clark Productions’s CEO Jay Penske said: “As stewards of the Golden Globe
                          Awards, our mission is to continue creating the most dynamic awards ceremony on live television
                          viewed across the world. We have a great team in place to grow this iconic brand and captivate new
                          and existing audiences to celebrate the very best in television and motion pictures.” The ceremony
                          is currently scheduled for January 7, though there is not yet a broadcast partner for the awards
                          show. It could feasibly end up on a major network or a streaming platform, as was the case for the
                          SAG Awards, which aired live on Netflix’s YouTube page earlier this year. On February 21, 2021, a
                          Los Angeles Times investigation accused the HFPA of “self-dealing” and highlighted potential
                          conflicts of interest. Among them was the fact that 30 HFPA members had been flown to France to
                          visit the set of Emily in Paris in 2019. Two years later, the series was nominated for two Golden
                          Globes, while more critically lauded shows like I May Destroy You were snubbed.

                          Here’s how it works Home / Features / Google Pixel Watch 2: the features we want from a smartwatch
                          successor The first Pixel Watch was a solid start - but there's room for improvement Android fans
                          had a lot to like about the Google Pixel Watch when it landed in October 2022: a minimal design,
                          slick Fitbit integration, and the best version of the firm’s Wear OS software to date. Google’s
                          first wearable effort wasn’t perfect, though. Battery life was a real downer, and the “one size
                          fits all” approach was off-kilter with the rest of the smartwatch world. That leaves plenty of
                          areas for a Pixel Watch 2 to improve upon. At the time of writing there’s still a fairly long wait
                          before a successor is set to turn up – but that doesn’t mean we can’t look to the future, or come
                          up with a laundry list of things we’d like to see make the cut by the time it does. Google hasn’t
                          said anything official about a second Pixel Watch. At the annual I/O event in May 2023, it quickly
                          breezed over WearOS to leave more time to focus on AI, coding and other upcoming hardware like the
                          Pixel Fold smartphone. The only info we have to go on right now is a single tweet from prolific
                          phone leaker EVleaks.

                          Shinzo Abe, the former prime minister of Japan and a serving member of the House of
                          Representatives, was assassinated on 8 July 2022 while speaking at a political event outside
                          Yamato-Saidaiji Station in Nara City, Nara Prefecture, Japan.[3][4][5] While delivering a campaign
                          speech for a Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) candidate, he was shot from behind at close range by a
                          man with an improvised firearm.[1] Abe was transported by a medical helicopter to Nara Medical
                          University Hospital in Kashihara, where he was pronounced dead.[6] Leaders from many nations
                          expressed shock and dismay at Abe's assassination,[7] which was the first of a former Japanese
                          prime minister since Saitō Makoto and Takahashi Korekiyo during the February 26 incident in
                          1936.[8] Prime Minister Kishida decided to hold a state funeral for Abe on 27 September.[9] The
                          suspect, 41-year-old Tetsuya Yamagami (Japanese: 山上 徹也), was arrested at the scene for attempted
                          murder; the charge was later upgraded to murder after Abe was pronounced dead. Yamagami told
                          investigators that he had shot Abe in relation to a grudge he held against the Unification Church
                          (UC), to which Abe and his family had political ties, over his mother's bankruptcy in 2002.

                          of Yamagami's homemade gun, from the roof of the nearby shopping mall Sanwa City Saidaiji. The

                          and that tent was used as a hideout by the sniper. The management company of Sanwa City Saidaiji

                          U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris attended the state funeral on Tuesday. TOKYO -- Thousands of
                          protesters opposed to the state-funded funeral of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe lined
                          the streets near parliament in Tokyo on Tuesday, as helicopters whizzed above and dignitaries from
                          all over the world paid their respects to the slain leader. U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, who
                          was among those who came Tokyo's famed Budokan arena on Tuesday, said she came out of respect for
                          the slain leader's legacy and that Abe was a great friend to the United States. Japan's government
                          said about 3,600 people from Japan and about 700 from overseas would come to the state funeral.
                          Abe's critics said he was a divisive, lackluster leader who trampled on Japan's democratic
                          principles. Local polls show that opposition to the state funeral was far greater than the support.
                          "Even though he's gone, he still somehow manages to obfuscate the truth," Kazuma, a man in his
                          seventies in attendance at a large protest, told ABC News. "How can we have a state funeral if the
                          taxpayers don't approve?" Mihoko Inagaki, a woman from Tokyo in her thirties, said, "There has to
                          be some debate over whether or not they should use taxpayer money for this. They can't just use it
                          without discussion or debate. It's a serious threat to our democracy.

                          27, 2022 for Shinzo Abe, the former prime minister who was assassinated in July, has split Japan.
                          (Kyodo News via AP) TOKYO (AP) — A rare state funeral for Shinzo Abe, the former prime minister who
                          was assassinated in July, has split Japan. The hawkish Abe was one of the nation’s most divisive
                          postwar leaders, but it is the ruling party’s cozy ties with the ultra-conservative Unification
                          Church that has fired up much of the opposition to the funeral. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is
                          battling a near-continuous political fallout from his handling of both the links to the church
                          among his party’s lawmakers and the state funeral he says Abe deserves. A look at some of the
                          reasons why the state funeral on Tuesday is causing so much anger: The tradition has roots in a
                          ceremony performed by the emperor to honor those who made exceptional contributions to the country.
                          The emperor before World War II was revered as a god, and public mourning for those honored with
                          state funerals was compulsory. Most state funerals were for members of the imperial family, but
                          political and military leaders were also honored, including Isoroku Yamamoto, who commanded Japan’s
                          Pearl Harbor attack and died in 1943. The state funeral law was scrapped after the war.

                          George R.R. Martin outlined the major events in House Targaryen's history, which means there's very
                          little direct character dialogue. People like Queen Alicent are quoted every now and then in
                          "testimony" from people at court, and this line is one of those times. As is revealed over the
                          course of episode six, Alicent has grown up and taken charge as queen — but few people seem to want
                          to openly discuss the growing evidence that Rhaenyra is having children with a man who is not her
                          husband. "Do keep trying, Ser Laenor," Alicent says to Rhaenyra's husband. "Sooner or late you
                          might get one that looks like you." Virtually everyone else at court besides Ser Criston Cole and
                          Queen Alicent seem content to feign ignorance about this flouncing of societal duties and customs.
                          By including this line in the episode, the "House of the Dragon" writers are emphasizing how
                          Alicent's direct barbs helped lead to Ser Harwin and Lyonel Strong's deaths in the final minutes of
                          the episode. Back in episode five, little Prince Aegon Targaryen II was a toddler. Now Aegon is a
                          teenager around 14 years old, the same age his mother Alicent and his half-sister Rhaenyra were in
                          the pilot episode. He's played by Ty Tennant (son of "Doctor Who" actor David Tennant).

                          a heartfelt reference to lesbian character Claire. The actress went on to add the caption, "Goodbye
                          Derry Girls, it’s been quite a ride 🌈," seeming to confirm that filming has indeed finished. We're
                          not crying, you're crying. Filming for Derry Girls season 3 was originally supposed to start in
                          June 2020, but was delayed due to the pandemic. However, on 1 November 2021, Nicola shared another
                          Instagram post featuring a behind-the-scenes snap from set, appearing to make the start of
                          production. Posting a very close-up selfie complete with her character Claire's signature fringe
                          and scrunchie pigtails, Nicola wrote, "Guess who’s back in the house #ReturnOfTheWeeLesbian" - in
                          reference to the season 1 episode which saw Claire come out as a lesbian. While it wasn't 100%
                          clear whether filming had properly started, Nicola certainly seemed to be in costume (hey, maybe
                          she just likes to dress up at home to get into character). While Nicola Coughlan has confirmed that
                          she's returning as Claire, the rest of the main cast will remain the same too.

                          is very much on it's way. Here's everything we know, from expected release date to trailer and
                          more. Good news, Derry Girls fans. We finally have a release date for the third and final series.
                          And it's soon! Mark it in your calendars and clear your diaries: The third and final series of
                          #DerryGirls starts Tuesday 12th April. Channel 4 announced the news with another first look clip at
                          the show, and oh it looks so good! One reply from a fan summed up our reaction nicely: "Thank God
                          we’ve got a date!!!! Need to take a days annual leave!" Yes! Finally! Our first look at the cast
                          back in action for the third and final time dropped in mid-March 2022, and it's so nice to see them
                          back to their usual mischief. Cast member Nicola Coughlan, who plays Claire Devlin in the series,
                          shared an Instagram post at the end of 2021 seeming to mark the end of filming - and it's very
                          emotional.

                          The 2022 Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded to the French author Annie Ernaux "for the courage
                          and clinical acuity with which she uncovers the roots, estrangements and collective restraints of
                          personal memory".[1][2] It was announced by the Swedish Academy on 6 October 2022.[3][4][5] Ernaux

                          Nobel Prize in Literature.[6][7] Ernaux started her literary career in 1974 with Les Armoires vides
                          ("Cleaned Out"), an autobiographical novel. Very early in her career, she turned away from fiction

                          plain language. Her books are followed by a wide readership, and are reviewed in most local and
                          national newspapers in France, as well as being the subject of many radio and television interviews
                          and programmes, and a large and growing international academic literature.

                          legally unable to own due to an FCC policy known as the "dual network rule", which prohibits
                          mergers between the top broadcast networks), Fox News, the national operations of Fox Sports, and
                          the 20th Century Fox studio lot, which would be leased to Disney for seven years. Fox's regional
                          sports networks were also included in the sale, but were later divested by order of the Department
                          of Justice, on the grounds that the Fox regional networks' combination with Disney's 80% ownership
                          of ESPN would make Disney too dominant in the cable sports market.[14][15][16][17][18] In May 2018

                          Century Fox held a stake in, and was planning to acquire the remainder). In July 2018, Fox agreed
                          to an increase of Disney's offer to $71.3 billion to fend off Comcast's counter-bid.[19][20]
                          British regulators ordered that a blind auction be held for Sky's assets, which was won by

                          system was not applied. The wording of the sporting regulations was subsequently amended for 2023,
                          so races that do not reach the 75 percent distance are awarded shortened race points regardless of
                          whether a race finishes under red or green flag conditions. The event was held across the weekend
                          of the 7–9 October. It was the eighteenth round of the 2022 Formula One World Championship and the
                          first time the event had been held since 2019, with the 2020 and 2021 races cancelled due to the
                          COVID-19 pandemic. Valtteri Bottas entered as the defending race winner.

                          national anthem.[12] The race started at 14:00 local time on 9 October 2022 under torrential rain
                          (which was the reason for so many incidents in the race) and was red-flagged on lap 2 after Ferrari
                          driver Carlos Sainz Jr. lost control into the hairpin of the opening lap and aquaplaned into the
                          barriers. A recovery vehicle was immediately dispatched, with several drivers passing the tractor
                          at speed under double-yellow flags on the second lap.[13] Alex Albon also retired due a collision
                          with Kevin Magnussen which caused damage to his radiator.[14] The race resumed at 16:15 local time
                          behind the safety car. Only twenty-eight laps were completed before the race was curtailed due to
                          it passing the three-hour time limit, with Verstappen taking his twelfth victory of the season.
                          Leclerc, who finished second on track, was given a five-second penalty for cutting the final
                          chicane whist defending from Pérez in third, which demoted him to third behind Pérez. The win meant
                          that Verstappen took the Championship title, leading Pérez by 113 points, with 112 points still
                          available.

                          wife.. and much more. Adrianna Tomaz, DC comics’ beloved superhero embodiment of the Egyptian
                          goddess Isis, is getting a brand new portrayal, courtesy of actress Sarah Shahi, in the upcoming
                          Dwayne Johnson-starring Black Adam. Ahead of the much-awaited film, here’s a look at Isis’
                          backstory, especially in terms of her superpowers, as well as the most significant events that have
                          shaped the character, all in accordance with the original comic books’ lore. Initially known as
                          Adrea Thomas, prior to DC’s reintroduction of the character in the comic series 52, published in
                          May 2006, Adrianna Tomaz, like most superheroes, was set up for an anguished backstory from the

                          Black Adam, Ruler of Kahndaq, by the tech-savvy organized crime syndicate, Intergang. Lionhearted
                          in her courage, she waits until Adam has slain her captors before letting her outspoken personality
                          shine through. She confidently presents to him her steadfastly-held opinions on how he, a dictator,
                          should get to altering his various tyrannical ways in order to most effectively govern his own
                          homeland!

                          dystopian near-future, with no connection to the Shazam family; she does have a hereditary magic
                          amulet, but it gives her wind powers and not the other suite of powers her comics counterpart has.

                          Searching for an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 to buy? Don’t worry. We’ve got your covered, by searching
                          through the best loot spots for you to get this beast of a GPU. The RTX 4090, Nvidia’s shining
                          star, is certainly one of the best graphics cards on the market right now. With jaw-dropping
                          performance metrics, it’s no wonder it carries a steep price tag of $1599. Since its introduction
                          on October 12, 2022, the Nvidia RTX 4090 has been going off the shelf rapidly. While retailers have
                          finally managed to get plenty of these powerful GPUs on their shelves, the Founders Edition is
                          always snatched up like hotcakes. As the speediest GPU in the 40-series, the RTX 4090 is far beyond
                          the capabilities of every other commercially available gaming GPU. If the hype around the RTX 4090
                          is anything to go by, we might see the RTX 4090 Ti drop sooner as a surprise patch update. Looking
                          back at previous releases, the RTX 4080 hit the scene in November, with the RTX 4070 Ti hot on its
                          heels in early January 2023, and the standard RTX 4070 was the latest to join the party. Even the
                          4060 Ti also debuted just over a month ago.

                          It’s barely worth it to resell these cards right now, and with only 281 GPUs sold in 3 weeks, the
                          demand is scarce. The average sale price has also been gradually trending lower ever since launch.
                          Nvidia’s flagship RTX 4090 can be found at various online retailers, such as and , but the cards
                          priced near MSRP are all sold out. Meanwhile, or near it, and there are plenty of cards . Some
                          models are just $50 shy of hitting the recommended list price of the 4090 — by default, without any
                          scalper tax. It almost feels like people would just rather buy the RTX 4090 instead. Having looked
                          at the eBay sales numbers for both GPUs, I can tell you one thing — the RTX 4090 doesn’t seem to
                          have slowed down just because the RTX 4080 launched. On the contrary, it benefited from the
                          release. While the RTX 4080 appears to be selling at a snail’s pace and scalpers are desperate to
                          get rid of it, the 4090 thrives, and it’s still a catch at MSRP. Considering the vast chasm of
                          performance between the two, the 4090 remains a better deal if caught at the recommended price of
                          $1,600, however expensive that might be.

                          In short — the RTX 4080 seems to have done the 4090 a favor. It made an overpriced GPU suddenly
                          appear much more desirable than it ever should have been. Now, the question is, was this Nvidia’s
                          plan all along, or did it simply overestimate the enthusiasm people would have for the 4080?
                          Considering the fact that Nvidia is planning to strategically cut the MSRP of the RTX 4080 soon, it
                          might be that it never intended for the 4080 to serve as a crutch for the sales of the 4090. Nvidia
                          also has some serious competition on the horizon. AMD will soon be launching the next-gen Radeon RX
                          7900 XTX and 7900 XT, both of which are supposed to rival the RTX 4080, but at more reasonable
                          prices — $999 and $899, respectively. With the upcoming price cut, the RTX 4080 might become a more
                          worthwhile contender. For now, if you manage to spot the 4090 for $1,600, it is a better deal — but
                          only if you can make use of it. If you’re a casual gamer, save your money and get the 4080 without
                          worrying about benchmarks and comparisons. Personally, I’m still waiting for the 7900 XTX, and
                          judging by the performance per dollar of the RTX 4080, I really have no regrets.

                          start in Winnipeg.[10] Two Lagoons and Astra Blue Media were then attached to co-produce, along

                          Telling the true story of one of the NBA greats, 'Sweetwater' is just around the corner. Sports
                          biopics have a long illustrious history within cinema, and in recent years they have taken our
                          screens by storm. Some standout favorites include the likes of Craig Gillespie's I, Tonya starring
                          Margot Robbie, the recent Netflix biopic The Swimmers, and the highly-praised Ford v Ferrari. The
                          hunger for more sports biopics is great, and the eyes of the world constantly await the next
                          offering. Well, one such offering is just around the corner, in the form of Martin Guigui's
                          Sweetwater (2023). Telling the tale of Nat Clifton, an NBA Hall of Famer, the film itself has been
                          in the works since 2007 and is finally being released this year. Of course, we know that the movie
                          will be about the life of Nat Clifton, but a film cannot simply show every aspect of a person's
                          life, and will often choose a specific period of importance. The official plot synopsis of
                          Sweetwater reads: "The film follows Clifton, who is the star attraction of the Harlem
                          Globetrotters, led by owner/coach Abe Saperstein.

Question 186              : When did the Google Pixel Watch start sell?
Correct Answers         :  
                          October 13, Oct 13, Oct. 13, 13 October, 13 Oct, 13 Oct.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - Answer              : October 13, 2022
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          This makes the Pixel Watch a bit more affordable than the Apple Watch Series 8 ($399) but pricier
                          than the Galaxy Watch 5 ($279) and recently-released Fitbit Sense 2 ($299). (See the rest of the
                          differences between the Google Pixel Watch vs. Fitbit Sense 2.) The Pixel Watch release date was
                          October 13, 2022, and since then we're continuing to track the best Pixel Watch deals. Note that
                          the Pixel Watch launched alongside the Google Pixel 7 and Google Pixel 7 Pro, which would both make
                          ideal companion devices for the company's smartwatch. The Google Pixel Watch is a simple-looking
                          smartwatch, I might even call it minimalistic. It comes in just one size: 41mm. Those with larger
                          wrists might complain about the lack of a larger option; that said, it fit me perfectly. The face
                          features a rounded design with a 3D glass dome. This raised effect distracts from the display's
                          thick bezel, but doesn't change the fact that a good chunk of the display is unusable. Perhaps my
                          prior experience with Samsung watches is to blame? I can't help but think it's a missed opportunity
                          to incorporate in digital rotating bezel in that space. It seems like no mistake that the Pixel
                          Watch is a "dark mode" device. The interface and all of Google's watch faces have black backgrounds
                          to further conceal the bezel.

                          the new Prospect Park Alliance President and Park Administrator has a long history in the parks
                          world and a storied record of leadership in support of her community. Most recently, Monaco served
                          as Executive Director of the Red Hook Initiative, a youth and community development nonprofit
                          impacting the 6,500 residents of the Red Hook Houses, Brooklyn’s largest public housing
                          development. Earlier in her career, Monaco served two tenures at the New York City Department of
                          Parks and Recreation, first as Director of the MillionTreesNYC Initiative and later as Director of
                          Stewardship for Forestry, Horticulture and Natural Resources. Monaco began her career at
                          StoryCorps, a national oral history project designed to build connections between people and share
                          the stories of Americans from all backgrounds and beliefs. Monaco currently lives in Windsor
                          Terrace, Brooklyn and her family is an avid user of Prospect Park. As she begins the new role and
                          leads Brooklyn’s Backyard into its next chapter, we chatted with Monaco about her vision for the
                          future of the park, favorite spots and more. What are you most looking forward to as you begin your
                          role? I am most looking forward to learning more about everything the Prospect Park team, both NYC
                          Parks and Alliance staff, does to maintain and sustain Brooklyn’s Backyard.

                          February 4, 2022 A message from Prospect Park Alliance President Sue Donoghue: I am writing to you
                          today with exciting news: Mayor Eric Adams has announced my appointment as the next New York City
                          Parks Commissioner. Serving as the President of Prospect Park Alliance and Park Administrator has
                          been one of the great honors of my career. I’ve been so lucky to work alongside so many dedicated
                          people, from Alliance and NYC Parks staff, to our incredibly hardworking volunteers and community
                          advocates, and a devoted Board of Directors that has provided the Alliance exceptional guidance and
                          leadership. I’m honored to be taking on a citywide leadership role in caring for New York City’s
                          most essential resource, its parks and open spaces, and I will continue to cherish and support
                          Prospect Park as a neighbor and park advocate. It has been a great privilege to steward this
                          breathtakingly beautiful space, and serve as only the third president of this thriving,
                          35-years-young organization. During this time we’ve advanced the park in numerous ways: rebounding
                          from the challenges of the pandemic through our Re:New Prospect Park initiative; restoring the
                          Flatbush Avenue perimeter and creating the first new entrances of the park since the 1940s;
                          revitalizing and expanding the park’s woodlands and natural areas; bringing back to the public the
                          exquisitely restored Endale Arch and Concert Grove Pavilion; and securing funds for our next great
                          phase of restoration, the 26-acre Vale in the park’s northeast corner.

Question 189              : What gaming software development studio did Riot Games acquire?
Correct Answers         :  
                          Wargaming Sydney

  - Source              :
                          By Jess Weatherbed, a news writer focused on creative industries, computing, and internet culture.
                          Jess started her career at TechRadar, covering news and hardware reviews. Video game developer and
                          publisher Riot Games has announced its acquisition of Wargaming Sydney, a gaming software
                          development studio that’s part of Cyprus-based Wargaming, the publisher behind titles such as World
                          of Tanks and World of Warships. Riot did not disclose the price of the purchase. Wargaming Sydney
                          is one of the largest games studios in Australia, formed under its original name of BigWorld back
                          in 2002. It was by Wargaming in 2012. The studio has created game development tools and other
                          software architecture required to develop online games such as MMOs. After the acquisition by Riot,
                          Wargaming Sydney will be renamed Riot Sydney and will assist in the development of Riot games such
                          as Valorant and League of Legends. Wargaming will maintain ownership of BigWorld Technology
                          Wargaming Sydney is the only operation being acquired by Riot Games, with other studios under the
                          Wargaming name unaffected by the purchase. Wargaming will also maintain ownership of BigWorld
                          technology’s gaming software architecture for its existing products. Riot says the newly branded
                          Riot Sydney will be a key contributor to its network of development studios.

                          5][20] In March 2016, Riot Games acquired Radiant Entertainment, another developer who was working
                          on Rising Thunder and Stonehearth at the time.[21] Rising Thunder was effectively canceled
                          following the acquisition, with the game's team allocated to a new project.[22] On October 13,
                          2017, Beck and Merrill announced that they were returning their focus to developing games, aiming
                          to create new experiences for video game and esports players.[23] Beck and Merrill handed over the
                          day-to-day operations and overall management of the League of Legends team to three longtime
                          employees: Dylan Jadeja, Scott Gelb, and Nicolo Laurent, who previously served as chief financial
                          officer (CFO), chief technology officer (CTO) and president, respectively.[23] Subsequently, Gelb
                          and Laurent assumed roles as chief operating officer (COO) and chief executive officer (CEO),
                          respectively, while Beck and Merrill became the Riot Games' chairmen.[24] As of May 2018[update],
                          Riot Games employed 2,500 people,[25] operating 24 offices around the world.[26] In October 2019,
                          Riot Games announced several new games: a version of League of Legends for mobile devices and
                          consoles called League of Legends: Wild Rift, a standalone mobile version of the Teamfight Tactics
                          mode from League of Legends, and the digital collectible card game titled Legends of Runeterra,
                          with all three scheduled for a 2020 release.

                          note 1] The company also teased further games — Project A, a tactical shooter; Project L, a
                          fighting game with League of Legends characters; and Project F, a multiplayer game set in Runeterra
                          – that were not detailed outside of genre descriptions and brief gameplay clips.[28][29] Project A
                          was later revealed to be Valorant, which entered closed beta on April 7, 2020[30] and was
                          officially released on June 2, 2020.[31] In December 2019, Riot Games announced Riot Forge, a
                          publishing label headed by Leanne Loombe. The label partners with smaller game development studios
                          for the creation of League of Legends games, with some games of this type already being in
                          development.[32] Two titles from Riot Forge were announced at The Game Awards 2019: Ruined King: A
                          League of Legends Story by Airship Syndicate, and Convergence: A League of Legends Story by Double
                          Stallion Games.[33] Another division, Riot Tabletop, was announced in January 2020, to producing
                          tabletop games; the first was Tellstones: King's Gambit, released in 2020.[34] Riot acquired
                          Hypixel Studios in April 2020, which they had been investing in over the previous eighteen months
                          to help them publish Hytale, a voxel-based sandbox game.[35] Also in April, Riot announced plans to
                          establish a Singapore office later that year.

                          Here's Gowrappan's memo to Yahoo staff: Team - We've entered a new chapter in our history, and I am
                          tremendously proud of all that we have accomplished together over the past three years. Like the
                          start of any next chapter, this is a natural moment for transition. I've made the decision to take
                          on a new role as a senior advisor to Apollo. This role will enable me to support our next phase of
                          growth and continued investment in the company. As such, I am excited to welcome Jim Lanzone as the
                          new CEO of Yahoo effective September 27, 2021. Jim is a veteran technology and media leader with
                          two decades of leadership experience and a deep track record of growth, innovation and an
                          entrepreneurial spirit. I have every confidence he will be a terrific leader for the new Yahoo. Jim
                          and I will work together to ensure a seamless transition, and I'm confident he will build on our
                          successes and lead us into our future. What an incredible journey this has been. I joined the
                          company three years ago as part of Verizon. Today, we're a standalone company with significant
                          potential to grow beyond what we have accomplished thus far. We have the best team, with the right
                          products, content and technology to shape the future of Yahoo. To reiterate what's been said many
                          times over the past few months – this next chapter is a testament to the great work you've
                          delivered against a focused strategy.

                          enthusiast brands at Ford (NYSE: F). Before joining the automaker last August, Bozeman spent
                          five-plus years as vice president of Amazon Transportation Services. Before that, he spent more
                          than eight years in top positions at Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT) and more than 16 years at
                          Harley-Davidson Motor Co. (NYSE: HOG). The choice of Bozeman may come as a surprise to many who

                          job. The position has been open since Bob Biesterfeld was let go at the beginning of the year.
                          During its most recent analyst call, Robinson said a decision would be made and announced by the

Question 191              : What is the subscriber growth of Netflix in Q3 2022?
Correct Answers         :

                          Enterprise and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply. Netflix added 2.41 million
                          global subscribers in the third quarter of 2022, bringing its grand total to 223.09 million (73.39
                          million from the U.S. and Canada), a gain of +4.5 percent over the prior year’s comparable quarter.
                          Q3 was the first quarter of 2022 when Netflix didn’t lose subs. According to Tuesday’s shareholder
                          letter, executives at Netflix believe they’ll add 4.50 million subs globally in the final quarter
                          of 2022. The streamer added 4.38 million subs in the year-ago quarter, which at the time
                          represented 9.4 percent growth. So we’re not there — but we are well above the company’s tempered
                          expectations; at the end of Q2, Netflix forecasted that it would add 1 million global subscribers
                          in Q3. Clearly, it bested that — the same goes for its financial forecasts. Netflix earned $3.10
                          per share in the third quarter on $7.926 billion in revenue; its net income was $1.398 billion.
                          Wall Street forecasted earnings of $2.13 per share on $7.84 billion in revenue. Back on July 19,
                          Netflix itself estimated Q3 earnings per share of $2.

                          growth has slowed in the last two years. In FY 2018 through FY 2020, quarterly subscriber growth
                          ranged from 20.0% to 26.0%. It decelerated to 13.6% in Q1 FY 2021 and further slowed in the
                          subsequent quarters, reaching 5.5% last quarter. Analysts now expect the slowest quarterly paid
                          subscriber growth in several years as the growth rate drops to 3.8% for Q3 FY 2022. IndieWire.

                          “you will not receive a response.” The company did switch off a divisive experiment locking 4K
                          videos behind a Premium subscription, but I have a feeling this family plan price increase is here
                          to stay. “We don’t make these decisions lightly, and we realize how hard this may be for our
                          members,” YouTube spokesperson Marni Greenberg said in a statement. “This new price reflects the

                          continue to support the creators and artists our members watch and listen to on YouTube.” The cost
                          of an individual YouTube Premium plan remains unchanged at $11.99 per month. YouTube doesn’t have
                          anything to share today about changes to other plans, Greenberg said, but noted that the company
                          will notify users by email at least 30 days in advance before changing the price. Update October

                          the upcoming preschool action-adventure animated comedy. The villains will go bumper-to-bumper

                          Batman), Jacob Bertrand (as Bam the Batmobile), and AJ Hudson (as Duke Thomas/Robin). Produced by

                          fall. The evil counterpart to the heroic Batwheels, the Legion of Zoom is a team of sentient
                          vehicles brought to computerized life by Badcomputer, the new ultimate computer of the DC Universe.
                          They, like the Batwheels, are essentially kids with little to no life experience. However, unlike
                          the Batwheels, “The Zooms” are under Badcomputer’s malevolent guidance and often don’t make the
                          best decisions.

Question 196              : Who is the new prime minister of the United Kingdom?
Correct Answers         :  
                          Rishi Sunak

                          The former chancellor wins Conservative Party leadership contest days after the dramatic
                          resignation of Liz Truss as prime minister. Rishi Sunak will become the United Kingdom’s new prime
                          minister after winning the ruling Conservative Party’s leadership contest, which was triggered by
                          the resignation of Liz Truss last week. Sunak’s win on Monday came days after Truss’s resignation
                          after her disastrous tax cuts plans and policy U-turns plunged the markets into chaos. The
                          unprecedented economic crisis drew a rare intervention from the Bank of England. Britain faces
                          serious economic challenges and needs stability and unity, Sunak said on Monday in his first public
                          speech since winning the contest. “There is no doubt we face a profound economic challenge,” Sunak
                          said. “We now need stability and unity, and I will make it my utmost priority to bring our party
                          and our country together.” Sunak, a former finance minister, has been left with the task of
                          steering a deeply divided country through an economic downturn set to make millions of people
                          poorer. Al Jazeera’s Andrew Simmons, reporting from London, said Sunak is “pretty well placed”
                          despite the challenges ahead. “In some ways, … some of his work has already been done in terms of
                          putting out the fires that Liz Truss created because it did cause a storm in the markets,” Simmons
                          said.

                          110] On 22 October, it was reported that Sunak had the required number of supporters—100 members of
                          the House of Commons—to run in the ballot on 24 October. The total number of MPs who publicly
                          declared support passed 100 on the afternoon of 22 October.[111] On 23 October, Sunak declared that
                          he would stand for election.[112] After Johnson ruled himself out of the race and Penny Mordaunt
                          withdrew her candidacy, Sunak was announced as the new Conservative leader on 24 October.[113]
                          Following Truss's resignation, Sunak, as the Leader of the Conservative Party, became prime
                          minister on 25 October 2022, after accepting King Charles III's invitation to form a
                          government.[114] He is both the first British Asian and the first Hindu prime minister of the
                          United Kingdom. In his first speech as prime minister, Sunak promised "integrity, professionalism
                          and accountability," and said that "we will create a future worthy of the sacrifices so many have
                          made and fill tomorrow, and everyday thereafter with hope."[115] Of his predecessor, Sunak said
                          that Truss "was not wrong" to want to improve growth, but admitted that "some mistakes were made",
                          and that he was elected prime minister in part to fix them. He promised to "place economic
                          stability and confidence at the heart of this government's agenda".[116] Sunak began to appoint his
                          cabinet on 25 October 2022.

                          served as chancellor of the Exchequer (2020–22). Sunak was born into a family with immigrant roots.

                          father were born in Tanzania and Kenya, respectively. They met and married after their families

                          fund his education, Sunak was able to attend Winchester College, the exclusive private school that
                          has produced no fewer than six chancellors of the Exchequer.

                          In the photos, taken at Dunsfold Aerodrome, Elizabeth Debicki’s Diana sports the late royal’s
                          iconic coif, as well as a floral midi dress. On November 5, 2021, Debicki was photographed wearing
                          a recreation of Princess Diana’s famous “revenge dress,” which she wore to the 1994 Vanity Fair
                          dinner at the Serpentine Gallery in London. That evening coincided with the airing of a documentary
                          featuring an interview that Prince Charles had with Jonathan Dimbleby, in which he admitted to
                          being unfaithful to Diana with Camilla Parker. Diana had bought the dress in 1991, but didn’t dare
                          to wear it at the time—an off-the-shoulder dress is against Royal protocol. The dress was perceived
                          by some as a form of vengeance against Prince Charles and his family. Finally, mere weeks before
                          season 5’s premiere, Netflix released official photos of multiple members of the cast looking
                          practically identical to their real-life counterparts. See the images below. New season, new

                          The White Lotus has been likened to an upper-class, American version of the British TV series,
                          Benidorm – the use of one primary setting is rooted in 2020’s Covid restrictions. Filmed from
                          October to December 2020, season one’s cast and crew were completely isolated during filming, with
                          a singular location used in order to avoid any cross contamination. Season 2 of The White Lotus was
                          filmed and set in Sicily, Italy – specifically at the the San Domenico Palace, Taormina, A Four
                          Seasons Hotel. Post-Covid, we see the stars branch slightly further afield than season 1, which was
                          filmed entirely in the hotel and its nearby beach. In season 2, spot the likes of Taormina, Noto,
                          Palermo, Cefalù, and this very beautiful villa.

                          Senate; with Kelly's victory in Arizona and a Democratic victory in Nevada, it was projected on
                          November 12 that the Democratic caucus would retain control of the Senate in the 118th United
                          States Congress.[6][7] Initially expected to be one of the most widely contested elections in the
                          nation, Kelly amassed a massive fundraising advantage over Masters, raising a record $75 million
                          dollars, compared to Masters's $12 million.[67] Due to the Supreme Court's ruling to overturn Roe
                          Vs. Wade, which gave states the right to ban abortion, Kelly spent heavily attacking Masters over
                          his anti abortion stance, which was seen as hurting Masters especially among women voters. He also
                          attacked Masters's support for privatizing social security, as Arizona has many retired seniors
                          whom use the program. Masters's belief that the 2020 presidential election was stolen also hurt him
                          among voters.[68] With the limited amount of money he had, Masters attempted to portray Kelly as
                          weak on illegal immigration, supportive of spending programs that caused inflation, and too
                          supportive of President Joe Biden. In the final weeks of the campaign, Republican groups began to
                          increase the amount of money they were spending on the race, and many news outlets moved the race
                          from Lean Democrat to tossup. However, in the end Kelly relatively easily defeated Masters, which
                          helped to allow Democrats to retain the Senate.[69] W Withdrawn Kelly won 5 out of 9 congressional
                          districts, including two that elected Republicans.[126]

                          This projection was based on a variety of metrics, including generic ballot testing that favored a
                          Republican-led Congress as well as President Biden’s low approval rating, which hovers around 40%.
                          Super PACS and political party groups were spending money almost exclusively in districts that
                          President Biden won in 2020, indicating that Democrats were in a defensive crouch. Midterm
                          elections often benefit the opposition political party at the expense of the White House’s party.
                          1994 and 2010 were typical midterm elections, where Republicans made gains in the House at the
                          midpoint of Bill Clinton and Barack Obama’s first terms. Similarly, in 2018, Republican’s got
                          crushed in House elections but picked up two seats in the Senate. If a president’s approval ratings
                          are high, then the presiding party typically fares better in midterm House elections. For example,
                          in 1998, Bill Clinton’s approval rating was 66%, and Democrats retained control of the House. In
                          2002, George W. Bush polled at a 63%, and Republicans made gains. Currently, Biden’s approval
                          rating is 42%, which is similar to former president Barack Obama’s rating in 2010. That year,
                          Democrats lost control of the House, similar to what occurred during this year’s midterms. After
                          each census, congressional district lines are redrawn. This Nov. 8 election was the first general
                          election since the redistricting process concluded.

                          NevadaToday Nevada Election Survey Project poll finds 52% of Nevadans plan to vote for Cortez Masto
                          As Nevadans begin voting in the 2022 midterm election, a new University of Nevada, Reno poll of
                          likely voters released today finds Catherine Cortez Masto leading in the race for U.S. senator and
                          Steve Sisolak leading in the governor’s race. The governor’s race is within the margin of error,
                          but the senate race is not. The Nevada Election Survey Project 2022 general election poll, which
                          asked nearly 600 likely Nevada voters about their voting intentions and views on state and national
                          officials, found 52% of Nevadans plan to vote for Cortez Masto, 39% for Adam Laxalt and 5% remain
                          undecided. Cortez Masto’s large lead reflects less Republican voter enthusiasm for Laxalt’s
                          candidacy compared to Joe Lombardo and other Republican candidates. Among likely Republican voters,
                          74% said they planned to support Laxalt, compared to 83% for Lombardo and 88% for their Republican
                          House of Representatives candidate. More Republicans also plan to support Cortez Masto than other
                          Democrats on the ballot. Even if this sample of Nevadans is unusually supportive of the incumbent
                          senator, lower support among any likely Republican voters for Laxalt, in what others have polled as
                          a very tight race, is noteworthy.

                          "Lullaby" is a song by English rock band the Cure from their eighth studio album, Disintegration
                          (1989). Released as a single on 10 April 1989, the song is the band's highest-charting single in
                          their home country, reaching number five on the UK Singles Chart. It additionally reached number
                          three in West Germany and Ireland while becoming a top-10 hit in several other European countries
                          and New Zealand. The music video, directed by Tim Pope, won the British Video of the Year at the
                          1990 Brit Awards. The meaning of "Lullaby" has been speculated by fans, including as a metonymy for
                          addiction, depression, or sexual assault,[2] and Smith has offered multiple explanations as to its
                          theme or content, such as childhood nightmares or abuse.[2] One explanation by Smith follows that
                          the song is about the disturbing songs his father sung to him as a kid, and the horrible ending
                          they would always have.[3] Tim Pope, a long-time collaborator of the Cure on many of its music
                          videos, interprets "Lullaby" as an allegory for lead singer Robert Smith's drug-addled past.[4]
                          Upon its release, "Lullaby" became the Cure's highest-charting hit in their home country when it
                          reached number five on the UK Singles Chart. It remains their only single to reach the top five in
                          the United Kingdom.

                          Millie Gibson is set to star as the new companion on Doctor Who, but is she qualified and what does
                          her casting indicate about the new series? 2023 marks the 60th Anniversary of Doctor Who, and it is
                          expected to be a big celebration for the popular British television series. Not only is fan
                          favorite David Tennant returning to the franchise for a series of specials, but Ncuti Gatwa has
                          been cast as the Fifteenth Doctor, the first black actor to play the iconic hero. While little is
                          known about the new Doctor, the BBC did announce that Millie Gibson has been cast as Ruby Sunday,
                          the Doctor's new companion. Much attention has been paid to Tennant's return and Gatwa's casting,
                          but Gibson is an exciting choice for the franchise. The companion is just as important for Doctor
                          Who as the Doctor himself, so the person cast in the role takes on a big responsibility. At just 18
                          years old, she will be the youngest person to be cast as a companion and was only a one-year-old
                          when the series was revived in 2005. Is the young star ready for such a major role? Her casting
                          might be the key to understanding the new direction for the series. The Doctor's companion is an
                          important role in the series, but this is a performance on a television series. This is not the
                          same as an actual medical doctor or a firefighter where one does expect years of training and a
                          certain level of experience to be considered qualified.

                          but has an ethereal quality that creates something grand and a sense of importance in that moment.

                          Group D of the 2022 FIFA World Cup took place from 22 to 30 November 2022.[1] The group consisted
                          of reigning world champions France, Australia, Denmark and Tunisia. The top two teams, France and
                          Australia advanced to the round of 16.[2] Australia, Denmark and France were also in Group C of the
                          previous World Cup. Notes In the round of 16: All times listed are local, AST (UTC+3).[1] The two
                          teams had faced each other twice, most recently in 2002, a 2–1 win for Denmark in a friendly game.
                          Denmark was not able to capitalize in their opening game; although Tunisia failed to score a single

                          After Argentina shockingly fell to Saudi Arabia 2-1 in their Group C opener in what goes down as
                          the biggest World Cup upset in history, they bounced back with consecutive 2-0 wins to claim top
                          spot in Group C. Poland also managed to squeeze into the knockout stages on goal difference with a
                          single goal keeping Mexico stuck in third spot. Despite stunning Argentina in their opening game,
                          Saudi Arabia ended up finishing bottom of the group after two straight losses. Argentina will now
                          face Australia in the Round of 16, while Poland will try to end France's title defence. WORLD CUP

                          one of the game’s greatest-ever players. Lionel Messi is now 35, and Qatar will be the last chance
                          for him to add the World Cup trophy to his already bulging cabinet and cap off a remarkable career,
                          after he confirmed it will be his last appearance at the tournament.

                          Across the Yahoo Network Thu, October 27, 2022 at 2:01:02 PM EDT The voice behind TikTok’s
                          text-to-speech feature has spoken — and she’s a Canadian local radio host. Kat Callaghan hosts The
                          Beat on 91.5 FM in Ontario. She also made a major reveal this month: She’s the voice of TikTok’s
                          text-to-speech feature. Iconic! Callaghan confessed in her very first TikTok video. For a long time
                          I didn’t say a word. But … yes it’s me and yes I have an ongoing awesome relationship with the
                          folks at TikTok. 🎉 The coolest part for me is watching the creativity & awesome content that people
                          are putting out there using my voice. (Also oddly enough this is my first TikTok) “When you guys
                          have been asking me if I’m the voice on TikTok,” the text-to-speech caption said. “Finally I can
                          tell you guys: It is me,” Callaghan said in her authentic voice. In the caption, she explained that
                          she has an awesome ongoing relationship with TikTok. “The coolest part for me is watching the
                          creativity & awesome content that people are putting out there using my voice,” Callaghan wrote.
                          The video received over 29.4 million views. Some were in shock, but not everyone believed she was
                          the voice they had heard for so long.

                          Lautaro Martinez REUTERS/Hannah Mckay Dec 18 (Reuters) - Argentina won their third World Cup trophy
                          after the final in Qatar on Sunday. Here is what you need to know about their route to the title: *
                          The top two in each World Cup group advance to the last 16. The knockout rounds, which began on
                          Dec. 3, feature one-off matches, which can go to extra time and penalties to decide the winners. *
                          Argentina recovered from their shock defeat to Saudi Arabia with back-to-back wins over Mexico and
                          Poland to finish as winners of Group C. * Lionel Messi and Julian Alvarez scored in Argentina's 2-1
                          win over Australia in their Round of 16 tie. * Argentina beat the Netherlands 4-3 in a penalty
                          shootout in their quarter-final tie, after Nahuel Molina and Messi's goals were cancelled out by a
                          brace from Dutch substitute Wout Weghorst. * Argentina beat Croatia 3-0 in the semi-finals, with
                          Messi coolly putting away a spot kick in the 34th minute to open the scoring before Alvarez found
                          the net either side of halftime.

                          Brazil defeated Spain 1-0 in the first round of the group stage, but both teams progressed to the
                          round of 16, and both were eliminated in a penalty shootout in the quarter-finals that year. After
                          performing below expectations in the last two World Cups, Spain will be keen to eliminate Brazil,
                          but we’re mapping the route of the five-time world champions here, and Tite’s men will progress to
                          the semi-final stage, where they’ll face… The supercomputer projects another South American rival
                          will stand in the way of Brazil’s route to glory. According to the numbers, Brazil will face their
                          neighbours Argentina in the semi-finals. In Group C, Argentina have the highest chance of any side
                          to progress from the group stages (90.2%) according to our model. It’ll be a relief for them, as
                          the runners-up in that group likely face current champions France in the last 16. By topping their
                          group, Argentina would then face Denmark, the predicted runners-up in Group D. In the
                          quarter-finals, their battle would be against the Netherlands from Group A, who would have
                          eliminated the USA in the first round of the knockouts. USA are projected to finish second in Group
                          B, ahead of Wales and Iran. Argentina arrive at the World Cup on the back of a 35-game unbeaten run
                          (W24 D11), the longest in their history.

                          The 2014 World Cup winners have many young players in their squad. Hansi Flick’s arrival is
                          definitely an upgrade but the players are taking time to adapt to his style of play. Nonetheless,
                          it will be an interesting match because Germany have players like Sane, Gnabry, Muller and even
                          Gotze with them. Besides Argentina, Brazil are the most favoured candidates to win the 2022 FIFA
                          World Cup. It would not be surprising to see Brazil defeat Argentina as well. Brazil lost to
                          Argentina in the Copa America final and ever since then, they are unbeaten in 15 matches. Brazil
                          have failed to make it past three Quarter-Finals over the past four World Cups. Neymar, Brazil’s
                          star player is key for all of their fixtures. The PSG superstar is in great form and is arguably
                          the most essential player for Brazil in the 2022 FIFA World Cup. If Argentina do face Brazil in the
                          Semi-finals, surely Neymar and Messi will play a prominent role to win the match for their home
                          nation. This will surely be one of the best matches in the 2022 FIFA World Cup if it happens. For

Question 219              : Who is starring Barbie in the movie "Barbie"?

                          It's quite possibly the most anticipated film of the year so far. Greta Gerwig's Barbie, starring
                          Margot Robbie as the eponymous doll and Ryan Gosling as Ken, finally arrives in theaters on July
                          21, 2023, after spending the better part of a decade in development. Gerwig's involvement was first
                          announced in 2019, marking the 60th anniversary of Barbie herself. Though Amy Schumer was
                          originally attached to develop Mattel's signature feature, the comedian left the project when it
                          was clear that executives at Mattel didn't see eye-to-eye with her feminist vision. "They
                          definitely didn't want to do it the way I wanted to do it, the only way I was interested in doing
                          it," she told Andy Cohen on an episode of Watch What Happens Live. Something must have changed
                          along the way because nearly everyone involved with the production of Barbie seems to agree that
                          Gerwig's interpretation of the iconic character is both feminist and funny. As we bide our time
                          until opening night, EW has compiled everything you need to know about the cast of Barbie.

                          Barbie had originally been in the works in 2015 with Oscar-winning Juno screenwriter Diablo Cody
                          before it moved to Amy Schumer in 2016 who was set to star and co-write. She dropped out in 2017
                          and later said: “They definitely didn’t want to do it the way I wanted to do it, the only way I was
                          interested in doing it.” It was then set to star Anne Hathaway before it finally went to Robbie,
                          who asked Gerwig to get involved. The film is set to be followed by another Mattel adaptation, a
                          take on Polly Pocket written and directed by Lena Dunham and starring Lily Collins. Dunham
                          confirmed in October she is still working on the script. Other Mattel films in development include
                          Masters of the Universe and Hot Wheels. Gerwig made her directorial debut with Lady Bird, which
                          earned five Oscar nominations before she brought a new adaptation of Little Women in 2019, which
                          garnered six Oscar nods. Robbie’s latest film, Babylon, co-starring Brad Pitt, hits cinemas this
                          month and she will be next seen in Wes Anderson’s Asteroid City alongside Tom Hanks, Scarlett
                          Johansson and Tilda Swinton. Barbie is set to land in cinemas in July 2023.

                          Berhalter announced on the eve of Monday’s Group B opener vs. Wales (2 pm ET | FOX, Telemundo). The
                          Leeds United midfielder and New York Red Bulls homegrown product will be the USMNT’s youngest

                          career international appearances. “We think he has great leadership capabilities,” Berhalter said
                          of the 23-year-old Wappingers Falls, New York native. “He leads by his actions and his words.” FIFA
                          requires teams to name a singular captain for the tournament; the USMNT were the last of 32
                          Qatar-qualified squads to complete that task. During Berhalter’s tenure, the USMNT have relied on a
                          leadership council and rotating armband responsibilities. Chelsea forward Christian Pulisic and
                          Nashville SC center back Walker Zimmerman were other leading candidates to be named captain. “A lot
                          of credit to my teammates,” Adams said, “because anyone throughout our leadership council can wear
                          that armband and represent us with pride and represent us in the right way." Adams debuted for the
                          Red Bulls in 2016 before moving to Europe in the winter of 2019, then to German Bundesliga side RB

                          workers and food processors. By Peter Baker WASHINGTON — President Biden announced Thursday that he
                          was investing $36 billion in federal funds to save the pensions of more than 350,000 union workers
                          and retirees, a demonstration of commitment to labor just a week after a rupture over an imposed
                          settlement of a threatened rail strike. Mr. Biden gathered top union leaders at the White House to
                          make the commitment, described by the White House as the largest ever award of federal financial
                          support for worker and retiree pension security. The money, coming from last year’s Covid-19 relief
                          package, will avert cuts of up to 60 percent in pensions for Teamster truck drivers, warehouse
                          workers, construction workers and food processors, mainly in the Midwest. “Thanks to today’s
                          announcement, hundreds of thousands of Americans can feel that sense of dignity again knowing that
                          they’ve provided for their families and their future, and it’s secure,” Mr. Biden said, joined by
                          Sean M. O’Brien, president of the Teamsters, and Liz Shuler, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., as

                          Profile Sections tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News WASHINGTON — No one knows better that
                          elections have consequences than labor union leaders, who secured an $83 billion pension-fund
                          bailout in President Joe Biden's American Rescue Plan Act. "Without Joe Biden winning, and we won
                          the two Senate seats in Georgia and we were able to do reconciliation, none of this would’ve
                          happened," James P. Hoffa, the general president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters,
                          said in a telephone interview with NBC News. "The Republicans weren’t going to do it. The
                          Teamsters' Central States pension fund, covering nearly 400,000 workers and retirees, is the
                          marquee beneficiary of pension provisions attached to the larger relief bill. But labor leaders say
                          as many as 200 plans will be shored up, providing direct benefit to as many as 1.5 million people
                          in the short term, and many more overall. "That means the difference between eating and not eating,
                          and having a good retirement and one where you’re basically out there working trying to survive,"
                          Hoffa said. "The No. 1 priority, we've solved it." This account of the Teamsters' drive to save
                          retirement plans for millions of pensioners is drawn from interviews with several of the union's
                          officials, congressional sources and the public record. It begins with one Hoffa, the late
                          Teamsters chief James R. Hoffa, and the Central States pension fund he started.

                          elections have consequences than labor union leaders, who secured an $83 billion pension-fund
                          bailout in President Joe Biden's American Rescue Plan Act. "Without Joe Biden winning, and we won
                          the two Senate seats in Georgia and we were able to do reconciliation, none of this would’ve
                          happened," James P. Hoffa, the general president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters,
                          said in a telephone interview with NBC News. "The Republicans weren’t going to do it. The
                          Teamsters' Central States pension fund, covering nearly 400,000 workers and retirees, is the
                          marquee beneficiary of pension provisions attached to the larger relief bill. But labor leaders say
                          as many as 200 plans will be shored up, providing direct benefit to as many as 1.5 million people
                          in the short term, and many more overall. "That means the difference between eating and not eating,
                          and having a good retirement and one where you’re basically out there working trying to survive,"
                          Hoffa said. "The No. 1 priority, we've solved it." This account of the Teamsters' drive to save
                          retirement plans for millions of pensioners is drawn from interviews with several of the union's
                          officials, congressional sources and the public record. It begins with one Hoffa, the late
                          Teamsters chief James R. Hoffa, and the Central States pension fund he started.

Question 223              : Who won the Maxwell Award 2022 in college football?

                          NCAAF 47 USC quarterback Caleb Williams won the 2022 Maxwell Award on Thursday, given to the best
                          player in college football. Here’s what you need to know: Williams was the best quarterback in
                          America this season, so the Maxwell Award was deserved. Williams led USC’s turnaround from a
                          four-win team to a top-10 squad in 2022 and elevated the players around him. Now his sights turn to
                          Saturday night and the Heisman Trophy. — Morales Duggan’s story has been one of the best in college
                          football, starting TCU’s season as the backup quarterback before leading the Horned Frogs to a 12-0
                          start. His toughness and perseverance helped pull the Frogs out of multiple second-half deficits
                          and without his poise, leadership and production late in games, TCU wouldn’t be in the College
                          Football Playoff. Winning the O’Brien and being a Heisman finalist are both well-deserved honors

                          RAYYAN, Qatar, Dec 6 (Reuters) - Morocco rode a wave of passionate support and kept the World Cup
                          dreams of the Arab world alive as they eliminated fancied Spain in a penalty shootout on Tuesday to
                          reach the quarter-finals. In doing so, they became the first Arab nation to advance to the last
                          eight, ensuring a breakthrough for the region in the first global tournament in the Middle East,
                          and also became the fourth African side to go this far in World Cup history. Their victory will be
                          seen as not only a triumph for Morocco but vindication of the controversial FIFA decision to hand
                          Qatar the hosting rights, adding significant gloss to another Arab success at the tournament like
                          Saudi Arabia beating Argentina and Tunisia upsetting holders France in the group phase. Morocco,
                          who edged Spain 3-0 in the shootout after a 0-0 draw at the end of two hours of energy-sapping
                          action, now have a chance to become both the Arab world and Africa's first-ever semi-finalists if
                          they continue to use the overwhelming support that has backed them through an impressive array of
                          results.

  - Source              :
                          In 2010, Ghana were the only one of six representatives to advance from the group stage in South
                          Africa. The Black Stars, combining the experience of their debut in 2006 with the promise of their
                          2009 under-20 World Cup winning team, played organised, disciplined football and, after wins over
                          Serbia and the USA, came within a handball of a place in the semi-finals. So, has all that promise
                          and hope disappeared? The inability of African teams to cross this rubicon is connected to the
                          continent’s economic disadvantages relative to Europe and South America. According to the World
                          Population Review, going by gross national income per capita (as of 2020), nine of the 10 poorest
                          countries in the world are in Africa. This creates a snowball effect that affects the continent’s
                          potential, restricting development, enabling corruption and impeding professionalism. Africa’s
                          World Cup outings have been littered with scandal, mostly about unpaid wages, that has led to
                          opprobrium and derailed focus. “The politics is too closely involved in the football,” former DR
                          Congo international Gabriel Zakuani told Al Jazeera. “With African countries, it plays such a big
                          part, especially for the local players who depend on those bonuses. If that doesn’t happen, the
                          focus shifts away from football. So that’s something that should be taken care of before you get to
                          the World Cup or a major tournament.

Correct Answers         :

                          Charlie Baker assumed the duties as the NCAA's sixth president on March 1, 2023. He was hired for
                          the position on Dec. 15, 2022, as he neared the conclusion of his term as the 72nd governor of
                          Massachusetts. A former collegiate athlete at Harvard, Baker is credited with bringing bipartisan
                          leadership to the state, successfully guiding Massachusetts through an exceptionally turbulent
                          period for government officials. In addition to his two terms as governor, he has brought decades
                          of experience spearheading transformations at high-profile institutions in the private and public
                          sectors. Baker has arrived at the NCAA at a moment of significant transformation. Legal shifts in
                          the environment surrounding college sports have challenged the NCAA's ability to serve as an
                          effective national regulator for college athletics, resulting in an untenable patchwork of
                          individual state laws. Partnering with federal policymakers to develop a consistent, sustainable
                          legal framework to address issues common to student-athletes and athletic departments across the
                          country is a top and immediate priority. A Republican governor serving a predominantly Democratic
                          state, Baker was re-elected to a second term in 2018 with 67 percent of the vote. After eight years
                          in office, he achieved approval ratings exceeding 75 percent, making him the highest-rated governor
                          in the United States and one of the highest-rated elected representatives in the nation. Baker
                          earned widespread support by taking on issues with significant real-world impacts, and approaching
                          them in substantive, innovative and bipartisan ways.

                          Mechelle Voepel: It took public embarrassment during the 2021 NCAA basketball tournaments for
                          Emmert to show interest in the women's event. The inequities between the men and women were obvious
                          and stark, which put the NCAA into damage-control mode. At that point, those in the women's
                          basketball world had to question if Emmert was very sincere in his concern, but there was a
                          "better-late-than-never" sentiment. And the NCAA's decision to commission the so-called Kaplan
                          report, which did a deep dive into inequities in all men's and women's NCAA championships, was an
                          important step because it didn't pull any punches about how significant those issues have been. The
                          report also said the NCAA has been selling women's sports short regarding potential television
                          revenue. When it's time to negotiate TV rights again, rather than selling multiple championships in
                          a bargain bundle, the NCAA needs to think bigger about the worth of each championship and how best
                          to maximize revenue from it. Also, the NCAA has to show more leadership regarding the inclusion of
                          transgender athletes in competition. As with so many things, the NCAA has been behind on this. Dave
                          Wilson: The next leader is going to have to get creative to figure out the mess of issues currently
                          embroiling college sports, or finally just step out of the way and put on tournaments. One coach
                          recently told me, "In all the threats facing the NCAA over the years, I've always been optimistic.

                          focus on business operations while he will concentrate on product design and new technology. Before

                          original offer price of $54.20 per share.[71][72] The deal closed on October 27, 2022, with the
                          merger between Twitter, Inc. and X Holdings II, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of X Holdings I,
                          Inc., wholly owned by Musk,[73] and Musk took control of the company,[74] paying $54.20 per share,
                          or about $44 billion.[75] By January 2023, Twitter only had around 2,300 employees left, according
                          to Musk, with only 550 working full-time.[76][77][78][79] By April, there were less than 1,500
                          active employees left[80] with 80% of Twitter's work force gone in a year.[81] On October 28,

                          day and was delisted on November 8.[83][84] On October 31, Musk announced in a security filing that

                          and became a member of Twitter's board of directors, and promised to "help in any way [he

                          drops, top projects, and much more! BY Jolene Creighton • May 11, 2023 Daniel Alegre, CEO of Yuga
                          Labs, just made a splash in the NFT world. On May 10, 2023, he purchased a Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT
                          for 50 ETH on Blur. At the time, the purchase was equal to about $90,000. Why is this so notable?
                          When Alegre made his purchase, the floor price for Bored Ape NFTs was about 44 ETH (around
                          $78,000), according to CoinGecko. In short, Alegre used his own money to buy an NFT from his own
                          company — and he bought it for quite a bit more than he needed to. Through his purchase, Alegre
                          likely hoped to demonstrate his belief in the BAYC NFT project and, more broadly, Yuga Labs’
                          portfolio of intellectual properties. Currently, this portfolio includes nearly all of the most
                          widely known and valuable projects in the NFT space — Bored Ape Yacht Club, Otherside, Mutant Ape
                          Yacht Club, Bored Ape Kennel Club, CryptoPunks, and Meebits.

                          These allegations led to a lawsuit being filed by the California Department of Fair Employment and
                          Housing against Activision Blizzard in July 2021. The company has also faced criticism for its
                          handling of the situation and the toxic work environment that allegedly exists within the company.
                          This has resulted in significant public backlash, with some fans and employees calling for boycotts
                          and protests. Alegre’s departure from Activision to Yuga Labs may be seen as a positive move for
                          those who are critical of Activision’s leadership and culture. It’s worth noting that the gaming
                          industry and the NFT space have both been the subject of intense scrutiny and controversy in recent
                          years. The allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination at Activision Blizzard have been a
                          particularly significant source of controversy in the gaming industry. Meanwhile, the NFT space has
                          faced criticism for its environmental impact and the high levels of speculation and price
                          volatility surrounding some NFTs. Furthermore, the recent fake news surrounding Bored Ape Yacht
                          Club (BAYC) highlights the need for responsible and informed reporting in the NFT space. Given
                          these issues, the appointment of Alegre as Yuga Labs’ CEO marks an interesting new phase for the
                          company. As Yuga Labs continues to expand its presence in the NFT gaming space, it will be
                          important for the company to navigate these complex issues with transparency and responsibility.

Question 231              : How much did Avatar: The Way of Water earn in its debut weekend at U.S.?

                          Next week sees the debut of Damien Chazelle’s “Babylon” and the family-friendly “Puss in Boots: The
                          Last Wish” but there are no comparable blockbusters until “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” in
                          February. The hope is that audiences will continue seeking “Avatar 2” out for weeks and months to
                          come, similar to the first movie. “Historically James Cameron’s movies are about the long haul, not
                          the opening weekend,” said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. “‘Avatar’ is
                          going to develop its box office over time. It’s about where it will end up months from now.”
                          Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to
                          Comscore, with Wednesday through Sunday in parentheses. Final domestic figures will be released
                          Monday. 1. “Avatar: The Way of Water,” $134 million. 2. “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,” $5.4
                          million. 3. “Violent Night,” $5 million. 4. “Strange World,” $2.2 million. 5. “The Menu,” $1.7
                          million. 6. “Devotion,” $825,000. 7. “The Fabelmans,” $750,000. 8. “Black Adam,” $500,000. 9. “I
                          Heard the Bells,” $308,893.

                          Domestically, “Avatar: The Way of Water” was released in 4,202 theaters on over 12,000 screens, 400
                          of which were IMAX 3D. The studio and filmmakers bet big on the draw, and higher prices, of the 3D
                          format and premium large screens. By the end of Friday, “Avatar: The Way of Water” had already
                          earned $53 million in the U.S. and Canada and $180.1 million globally, aided by a China release —
                          the first major Hollywood release in the country since “Minions: The Rise of Gru” in August. It
                          blows “Avatar’s” $26.7 million first day in 2009 out of the water, though that didn’t include
                          Thursday previews. As with many ambitious Cameron projects, from “Titanic” to the first “Avatar,”
                          nerves were high for the costly sequel, one of the most expensive of all time, which began
                          production five years ago. It faced repeated delays and weathered The Walt Disney Co’s acquisition
                          of 21st Century Fox in 2019. It’s also one of four “Avatar” sequels Cameron had in mind. Filming on
                          the third movie, which shot simultaneously with “The Way of Water,” is done, with an expected
                          release in December 2024.

                          Square Enix has confirmed that the Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters, which are essentially upgraded
                          versions of Final Fantasy 1-6, will be released on Nintendo Switch and PS4 on April 19, 2023. The
                          Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters are currently available on PC and mobile, and soon a new audience
                          will be able to experience much of the history of the Final Fantasy franchise in a new way. If that
                          wasn't exciting enough, these versions come with a new pixel font, which seems to address one of
                          the biggest issues fans had with the games when they first were released - the questionable choice
                          of font by Square Enix for these remasters that left many unhappy. There will also be a new option
                          to switch between the original and new background music whenever you so choose, and there are more
                          options to adjust encounter rate, EXP, Gil, and ABP. All six games will be available on April 19 at
                          8am PT/11am ET/4pm BST, and fans will be able to purchase them individually or as a complete
                          package. On the eShop, the games range from $11.99-$17.99 per game, and all six can be purchased
                          for $74.99. For more, check out seven things you probably didn't know about Final Fantasy 1-3 and

                          its remarkable run of accolades, from the Golden Globes to the Baftas. Del Toro has used the
                          platform afforded by his nominations to champion the medium of animation as true cinema,
                          proclaiming in his Bafta award speech: Animation is not a genre for kids. It’s a medium for art,
                          it’s a medium for film and I think animation should stay in the conversation. His rendition of
                          Pinocchio has certainly started a conversation, not least in gaining an impressive audience on
                          Netflix. His film demonstrates that in the right creative environment – and with an innovator at
                          the helm – a well-worn narrative, such as Pinocchio, can evolve. Such revitalisation of the
                          Pinocchio story was in part possible because – as he says himself – del Toro didn’t craft his
                          retelling solely with children in mind.

                          A new co-orbital asteroid for Earth? @AdrienCoffinet noticed that newly-discovered asteroid 2022 YG
                          has been circling Earth as a quasi asteroid since 1961 and will continue to do so until 2181. More
                          observations may refine this. pic.twitter.com/FJ5IkTotaV Visualizations of the orbital data for
                          2022 YG show it taking an odd path around our planet, stretching into an elongated ellipse in one
                          direction, then migrating back to a more circular orbit and stretching out again in the other
                          direction before the whole cycle repeats itself. Watching the asteroid's projected path over a
                          period of a few centuries is oddly hypnotic in this visualization posted to YouTube. Previous "mini
                          moons" included asteroids 2020 CD3 and 2006 RH120, but both only stayed for a relatively short
                          time. More observations are needed to refine the apparent orbit of 2022 YG to see if it truly will
                          be with us deep into the next century. There have been mini-moon false alarms in the recent past.
                          An apparent new tiny satellite spotted in 2020 turned out to be a big hunk of space junk from a

Question 237              : What is the price of Microsoft 365 Basic per month?
Correct Answers         :  
                          $1.99
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - Answer              : $1.99
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          The main difference between the $6.99 Personal subscription and this new $1.99 Basic one (other
                          than the amount of cloud storage) is that Microsoft 365 Basic doesn’t include access to the desktop
                          versions of Word, Excel, and PowerPoint apps. Basic subscribers will have to use the web or mobile
                          versions instead. “We know many people are using our services today, but some of them run out of
                          storage or want additional benefits that you don’t get with the free Microsoft 365 experience,”
                          says Oystryk. “We also designed this specifically with Windows users in mind.” The Microsoft 365
                          Basic package is aimed at Windows users that need extra storage but also feels like Microsoft’s way
                          of familiarizing people with its productivity subscriptions. “Is the Office brand going away
                          entirely? No.” Microsoft is also renaming its Office app on mobile and Windows to Microsoft 365
                          later this month. It reflects the branding changes Microsoft announced last year, where Microsoft
                          Office will largely be referred to as Microsoft 365 going forward. “Is the Office brand going away
                          entirely? No,” explains Oystryk. “We’ve really invested a lot in Microsoft 365 and it’s really
                          become our flagship productivity suite, so Office plays less of a role given that’s where our focus
                          is. You’ll still see Office show up in certain contexts.

                          Asatryan Published on January 18th, 2023, 8:00 am EST Picture: Netflix Zack Snyder is teaming up
                          with Netflix to produce and direct two major sci-fi movies: Rebel Moon Part 1 and Part 2. The new
                          movie(s) is described as an epic sci-fi adventure compared with Star Wars in scope and scale.
                          Here’s an updated look at what we can expect from Rebel Moon which is now confirmed to arrive on
                          Netflix in December 2023. Zack Snyder will direct and co-write the film and will reunite with many
                          of his colleagues from past projects. The script for Rebel Moon will be co-written by Shay Hatten,
                          who co-wrote Army of the Dead, and Kurt Johnstad, who worked on 300 with Snyder. The Stone Quarry
                          is the main production company behind the movie with Grand Electric also listed, which is Eric
                          Newman’s production company that has an overall deal with Netflix. Snyder commented on the
                          inspiration for Rebel Moon in his THR interview: “This is me growing up as an Akira Kurosawa fan, a
                          Star Wars fan. It’s my love of sci-fi and a giant adventure.” @Netflix Let's go! https://t.

                          annual level to the 2022 annual level), compared with an increase of 5.9 percent in 2021 (table 1).
                          The increase in real GDP in 2022 primarily reflected increases in consumer spending, exports,
                          private inventory investment, and nonresidential fixed investment that were partly offset by
                          decreases in residential fixed investment and federal government spending. Imports increased (table
                          2). The increase in consumer spending reflected an increase in services that was partly offset by a
                          decrease in goods. Within services, the increase was led by "other" services (mainly international
                          travel), food services and accommodations, and health care. The decrease in goods primarily
                          reflected decreases in food and beverages as well as motor vehicles and parts that were partly
                          offset by increases in recreational goods and vehicles and "other" nondurable goods (mainly
                          pharmaceuticals). The increase in exports reflected increases in both goods and services. The
                          increase in private inventory investment primarily reflected increases in manufacturing, wholesale
                          trade, and retail trade industries. The increase in nonresidential fixed investment reflected
                          increases in intellectual property products (led by software) and in equipment (led by information
                          processing equipment) that were partly offset by a decrease in structures (led by commercial and
                          health care as well as power and communication structures).

                          only a studio-produced sequel but also a superhero movie made in 2023. One should expect a certain
                          level of creative committee-mandated, Mad Libs-y monotony, regardless of how one feels about the
                          surprisingly decent “Shazam!”. The makers of that fine-enough 2019 franchise-starter, including
                          director David F. Sandberg, toned down both the Troma Lite cynicism and post-Spielberg
                          sentimentality that’s come to define the lighthearted James Gunn-style super-projects that dominate
                          the landscape. “Shazam! Fury of the Gods” meanders further in that direction. The first “Shazam!”
                          works as well as it does because it’s mostly focused on two adolescent pipsqueaks, Billy Batson
                          (Asher Angel) and Freddy Freeman (Jack Dylan Grazer), who get sucked into a generic fantasy, with
                          some assistance from their extended family of orphan buddies. “Shazam! Fury of the Gods” mostly
                          sticks to the comic book formula that the first movie poked fun at, despite another strong comedic
                          performance from star Zachary Levi and some sporadic yuks throughout. It’s schtickier and less
                          assured than the first “Shazam!” but these leftovers still reheat well enough.

                          32 teams being within a 10 km radius of each other, and are concentrated within the Doha area. It
                          was the first Cup since 1930 in which players did not need to take flights to matches and could
                          remain at the same training base throughout the entire tournament.[104][105] FIFA's six continental
                          confederations organised their own qualifying competitions. All 211 FIFA member associations were
                          eligible to enter qualification. The Qatari national team, as hosts, qualified automatically for
                          the tournament. However, the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) obliged Qatar to participate in the
                          Asian qualifying stage as the first two rounds also act as qualification for the 2023 AFC Asian
                          Cup.[106] Since Qatar reached the final stage as winners in their group, Lebanon, the fifth-best
                          second place team, advanced instead.[107] France, the reigning World Cup champions also went
                          through qualifying stages as normal.[108] Saint Lucia initially entered CONCACAF qualification but
                          withdrew from it before their first match. North Korea withdrew from the AFC qualifying round due
                          to safety concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Both American Samoa and Samoa withdrew before
                          the OFC qualification draw.[109] Tonga withdrew after the 2022 Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha'apai eruption

                          Georgia questioned TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew on how safe the popular app is for children. TikTok CEO
                          Shou Zi Chew testified Thursday at a congressional hearing over concerns about user data collected
                          by the popular video-sharing app and potential Chinese spying. Under his helm, TikTok reached 150
                          million users in the U.S., the majority of them teens and young adults who are attracted to the
                          app’s simple interface and addictive algorithm that serves up short videos on just about any
                          imaginable topic. Lawmakers have said they’re worried about American data falling into the hands of
                          the Chinese government and claim it threatens national security and user privacy and could be used
                          to promote pro-Beijing propaganda and misinformation. Chew attempted to persuade lawmakers not to
                          pursue a ban on the app or force Chinese parent company ByteDance to give up its ownership stake,

                          that features pixelated cartoon versions of characters from the TV show. On Monday, Twitch gave the
                          channel a 14-day ban after language model tools from OpenAI went haywire and generated transphobic
                          content that violated community guidelines. Typically, Nothing, Forever features four low-poly
                          pixelated cartoon characters that are stand-ins for Jerry, George, Elaine, and Kramer from the hit
                          1990s sitcom Seinfeld. They sit around a New York apartment and talk about life, and sometimes the
                          topics of conversation unexpectedly get deep, such as in this viewer-captured segment where they
                          discussed the afterlife. Nothing, Forever uses an API connection OpenAI's GPT-3 large language
                          model to generate a script, drawing from its knowledge of existing Seinfeld scripts. Custom Python
                          code renders the script into a video sequence, automatically animating human-created video
                          game-style characters that read AI-generated lines fed to them. One of its creators provided more
                          technical details on how it works in a Reddit comment from December. As a new media experiment, the
                          faux-Seinfeld stream often feels awkward and unfunny, but it's still interesting because viewers
                          never know what the characters will talk about next.

                          “In addition to the third party services we’ve used, we have a lot of proprietary generative
                          algorithms that cause the show to be ‘formed’, so to be speak. We collectively call this logic the
                          ‘director,’ as it is largely responsible for making sure all the individual pieces come together
                          into a whole,” Hartle said via email. “It’s worth mentioning that we don’t generate the artwork or
                          the laugh track — those are precanned assets, but we have ideas on how to do that in the future.”
                          Hartle told Polygon that the look mimicked the era of ’90s point-and-click games that came out
                          around the same time as Seinfeld. “We thought it worked well with the overall vibe of the show and
                          lended itself to the strange/eeriness, too, but the big goal was to have it be thematically
                          relevant,” Hartle said over email. This AI-generated version of Seinfeld doesn’t really compare to
                          the original, but you can definitely see the influence of the original show in snippets of this
                          version. In one part of the stream I watched, the characters started talking about creating a place
                          where they could make their own pizza crust, which appears to be connected to a bit in Seinfeld
                          where Kramer gets a business idea to open a pizzeria where guests make their own pizzas. One
                          popular clip actually has decent dialogue. It’s titled, “Elaine goes out with a guy who hates fruit.

                          Iowa's public schools are the foundation of our education system. For most families, they are the
                          option of choice – and they should be. But public schools aren’t the only choice, and for some
                          families, a different educational path may be better for their children. Governor Reynolds believes
                          Iowa’s investment in education should support the success of all students, including those whose
                          families choose to enroll them in an accredited private school rather than a public school.
                          Students First Act signed into law On January 24, 2023, Governor Reynolds signed the Students First
                          Act into law, just two weeks after introducing it in her annual Condition of the State address. The
                          bill makes state education funding available for K-12 students who choose to attend private
                          schools. It also provides public schools with additional categorical funding for students who live
                          in their district but attend private schools, and allows public school districts to use unspent
                          money from some categorical funds to supplement teacher salaries. Education Savings Accounts With
                          the passage of the Students First Act, parents who enroll their eligible children in an accredited
                          private school will receive an amount equal to the per pupil funds allocated by the state to all
                          public school districts each year. The funds are estimated at $7,598 per pupil for the 2023-2024
                          school year and will be deposited into an education savings account (ESA) to be used for tuition,
                          fees, and other qualified education expenses.

                          text-to-image tool – is getting more popular every day, with the community creating awesome (and
                          often really weird) pictures on Discord. But what is Midjourney from the creator's standpoint? The
                          tool's founder David Holz answered this question in a recent interview with The Verge, talking
                          about Midjourney's art style, copyright issues, and what AI is. Midjourney creators see their tool
                          "as an engine for the imagination," "a very positive and humanistic thing." Holz answered the most
                          popular question asked by artists when they deal with such technology: won't AI replace human art
                          one day? "What does it mean when computers are better at visual imagination than 99 percent of
                          humans? That doesn’t mean we will stop imagining. Cars are faster than humans, but that doesn’t
                          mean we stopped walking. When we’re moving huge amounts of stuff over huge distances, we need
                          engines, whether that’s airplanes or boats or cars." Moreover, Midjourney is a social product with
                          its huge Discord server created because "people really like imagining together." This social
                          aspect, however, could potentially cause problems for the AI due to copyright, and while you can’t
                          copyright AI-generated art, some artists might not be happy about technology taking their unique
                          style to train on.

                          said, is pretty small right now. "We're like about 10 people," he explained. "We're self-funded. We
                          have no investors. We're not really financially motivated. We're just sort of here to work on
                          things we're passionate about and have fun. And we were working on a lot of different projects."
                          Holz said the technological aspect of AI and the extent to which it will improve is fairly easy to
                          foresee. "But the human ramifications of that are so hard to imagine," he said. "There's something
                          here that's at the intersection of humanity and technology. In order to really figure out what this
                          is and what it should be, we really need to do a lot of experiments." The unsettled nature of AI
                          image technology is evident in the difference between tools like Midjourney and a downloadable open
                          source graphics application like Blender, or a locally installed commercial application like Adobe
                          Photoshop (before it became a cloud service). Midjourney exists in a social context. Its front-end
                          is the chat service Discord. New users log in to Discord's Midjourney server and can then submit
                          text prompts to generate images alongside numerous other users in any of the various newbie
                          channels. The resulting images for all the users in that channel surface in about a minute, which
                          helps reinforce the notion of community.

                          the more ChatGPT-like experience for questions that are a bit more vague and that don’t have an
                          exact answer. The only other major difference you’ll likely note right away is that Bing will
                          occasionally try to prompt you with its own questions, too, and suggest potential answers to those
                          questions. Microsoft’s model is clearly far more up-to-date compared to what ChatGPT currently
                          offers. This includes pricing data, for example, or the ability to use recent data for travel tips
                          and itineraries — and it’ll also happily write you an email to share this itinerary with your
                          family. Image Credits: TechCrunch/Frederic Lardinois Image Credits: TechCrunch/Frederic Lardinois
                          Another important feature here — and one that I think we’ll see in most of these tools — is that
                          Bing cites its sources and links to them in a “learn more” section at the end of its answers. Every
                          result will also include a feedback option. It’s also worth stressing that the old, link-centric
                          version of Bing isn’t going away. You can still use it just like before, but now enhanced with AI.

                          On July 29, 2009, Microsoft and Yahoo! announced that they had made a ten-year deal in which the
                          Yahoo! search engine would be replaced by Bing, retaining the Yahoo! user interface. Yahoo! got to
                          keep 88% of the revenue from all search ad sales on its site for the first five years of the deal,
                          and have the right to sell advertising on some Microsoft sites.[24][25] All Yahoo! Search global
                          customers and partners made the transition by early 2012.[6] On July 31, 2009, The Laptop Company,
                          Inc. stated in a press release that it would challenge Bing's trademark application, alleging that
                          Bing may cause confusion in the marketplace as Bing and their product BongoBing both do online
                          product search.[26] Software company TeraByte Unlimited, which has a product called BootIt Next
                          Generation (abbreviated to BING), also contended the trademark application on similar grounds, as
                          did a Missouri-based design company called Bing! Information Design.[27] Microsoft contended that
                          claims challenging its trademark were without merit because these companies filed for U.S. federal
                          trademark applications only after Microsoft filed for the Bing trademark in March 2009.[28] In
                          October 2011, Microsoft stated that they were working on new back-end search infrastructure with
                          the goal of delivering faster and slightly more relevant search results for users.

                          the more ChatGPT-like experience for questions that are a bit more vague and that don’t have an
                          exact answer. The only other major difference you’ll likely note right away is that Bing will
                          occasionally try to prompt you with its own questions, too, and suggest potential answers to those
                          questions. Microsoft’s model is clearly far more up-to-date compared to what ChatGPT currently
                          offers. This includes pricing data, for example, or the ability to use recent data for travel tips
                          and itineraries — and it’ll also happily write you an email to share this itinerary with your
                          family. Image Credits: TechCrunch/Frederic Lardinois Image Credits: TechCrunch/Frederic Lardinois
                          Another important feature here — and one that I think we’ll see in most of these tools — is that
                          Bing cites its sources and links to them in a “learn more” section at the end of its answers. Every
                          result will also include a feedback option. It’s also worth stressing that the old, link-centric
                          version of Bing isn’t going away. You can still use it just like before, but now enhanced with AI.

                          The company’s headcount ballooned during the pandemic from 48,000 on March 31, 2020 to 87,000
                          before layoffs started in November. “We should prepare ourselves for the possibility that this new
                          economic reality will continue for many years.” During Meta’s last earnings call in February,
                          Zuckerberg declared this the “year of efficiency,” even as he continues to spend billions to build
                          out his vision of the metaverse. Since November’s layoffs, he has been focused on reducing layers
                          of management, telling employees in January, “I don’t think you want a management structure that’s
                          just managers managing managers, managing managers, managing managers, managing the people who are
                          doing the work.” In his memo announcing more layoffs, Zuckerberg said that it no longer makes sense
                          for managers to have only “a few” direct reports and confirmed that many of them will be asked to
                          become individual contributors throughout the company. “A leaner org will execute its highest
                          priorities faster,” he wrote. “People will be more productive, and their work will be more fun and
                          fulfilling.” He said Meta will continue canceling low-priority projects throughout the company and
                          that he had “underestimated the indirect costs” of running them. Just yesterday, Meta said it would
                          end work to facilitate the sharing of NFTs on Facebook and Instagram, and a standalone product
                          group for creating new social apps called New Product Experimentation was quietly canned last week.

                          Super Bowl LVII was an American football game played to determine the champion of the National
                          Football League (NFL) for the 2022 season. The American Football Conference (AFC) champion Kansas
                          City Chiefs defeated the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Philadelphia Eagles, 38–35.
                          The game was played on February 12, 2023, at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. It was the
                          fourth Super Bowl hosted by the Phoenix metropolitan area, and the third at this venue, with the
                          most recent previously being Super Bowl XLIX in 2015 (then known as University of Phoenix
                          Stadium).[6] Both teams finished the regular season with a league-best 14–3 record. This was the
                          Eagles fourth Super Bowl appearance overall and the second in the last six seasons, having
                          previously won Super Bowl LII; the Eagles previously lost Super Bowls XV and XXXIX. This was the
                          Chiefs' fifth Super Bowl appearance overall and third in the last four seasons, having previously
                          won Super Bowls IV and LIV, and losses in Super Bowls I and LV. After the Eagles went into halftime
                          up 24–14, the Chiefs mounted a comeback to win the game 38–35 with a game-winning field goal kicked
                          by Harrison Butker. Butker's game winning kick was set up by a pivotal and controversial defensive
                          holding call on Philadelphia cornerback James Bradberry, which was criticized by some observers but
                          supported by others.

                          Milton Williams (4 sacks). Pro Bowl linebacker Haason Reddick ranked second in the NFL with 16
                          sacks while forcing five fumbles and recovering three. Linebackers T. J. Edwards and Kyzir White
                          each recorded over 100 combined tackles and broke up seven passes. In the secondary, safety C. J.

                          James Bradberry each had three.[44] It was Philadelphia's fourth Super Bowl, following a win in
                          Super Bowl LII and losses in Super Bowls XV and XXXIX. The Eagles also won three pre-Super Bowl NFL
                          championships in 1948, 1949, and 1960.[45] The Chiefs entered the playoffs as the No. 1 seed in the
                          AFC. They defeated the Jacksonville Jaguars, 27–20, in the AFC Divisional round. In a tightly
                          contested game, the Chiefs held off a late fourth-quarter rally by the Jaguars. Chiefs quarterback
                          Patrick Mahomes went down early in the game with a high right ankle sprain injury which forced him
                          out of the game for a drive, but he was able to return shortly after leaving.

  - Source              :
                          Given my background as a senior value engineer, I made the obvious leap: Could what they do to
                          train these llamas help us provide a better, more reliable patient experience? After we got home, I
                          called the owner of Wilderness Ridge Llamas to learn how the llamas were trained. The boss told me:
                          If you can’t do it right, don’t do it at all. If you can’t spend all the time training, it won’t be
                          worth it. These were the key principles they used to train the llamas. And while humans may be a
                          long way from llamas in the phylogenetic tree, the principles might work for us, too. Whether
                          llamas or people, you get a reliable experience by training right: Apply these principles to your
                          learners: Every person—and every llama—is different. My llama needed a firmer hand than my son’s.
                          When they train the llamas, they take that into account. They train baby llamas differently than
                          older llamas. They provide a different level of attention and set lower expectations. We can apply
                          that to people, too. Not everyone has the same knowledge or the same skill set. That’s why I like
                          to find out who’s going to be in a class I am teaching. We need to understand people’s backgrounds
                          and where they are coming from so we can present material in the appropriate way. Is the audience
                          medical students or physicians?

                          the inventive Everything Everywhere All at Once a run for the money. But in the end, the latter

                          By Linda Holmes Of the 20 nominees in acting categories this year, 16 are first-timers. Only Cate
                          Blanchett, Michelle Williams, Judd Hirsch and Angela Bassett have been nominated before. Only
                          Blanchett has ever won (twice). The flood of newcomers includes the entire best actor field —
                          Austin Butler for Elvis, Colin Farrell for The Banshees of Inisherin, Brendan Fraser for The Whale,
                          Bill Nighy for Living, and Paul Mescal for Aftersun. Butler and Fraser have won most of the
                          so-called precursor awards; Butler won the Golden Globe, Fraser won the Screen Actors Guild Award.
                          There are new nominees who have been around for long enough that their lack of prior nominations
                          feels surprising, like Nighy or Jamie Lee Curtis. But there are also some who are much newer to the
                          scene, like Butler and Stephanie Hsu. And, too, there are comeback stories in both Fraser and Ke
                          Huy Quan, who have both been welcomed as evidence that perseverance can work, even in a punishing
                          industry. By Bob Mondello History’s already been made at the 95th Academy Awards, no matter who
                          takes home the gold statues.

                          season as host. The panel of coaches for the season consists of Blake Shelton, who returned for his
                          twenty-third and final season as a coach; returning coach Kelly Clarkson, who returned for her
                          ninth season after a one-season hiatus; and debuting coaches Chance the Rapper and Niall Horan.[3]

                          finale that aired on May 23, 2023. Her victory marks Niall Horan's first win as a coach, with Horan

                          be produced per cyclical year,[6] though it was reported that this decision was reversed upon the

  - Source              :
                          Twitter owner Elon Musk has founded a new artificial intelligence company named X.AI, according to
                          a Nevada business filing from last month. The filing, dated March 9, lists Musk as the company’s
                          sole director and Jared Birchall, who manages Musk’s family office, as its secretary. Musk has been
                          publicly skeptical of the future of artificial intelligence in the past and has even called for a
                          complete AI development pause, citing “risks to society” he says the technology poses. “Recent
                          months have seen AI labs locked in an out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful
                          digital minds that no one – not even their creators – can understand, predict, or reliably
                          control,” a group of tech experts including Musk said in an open letter calling for the development
                          pause last month. In an interview with Fox News’s Tucker Carlson that will air next week, Musk
                          warned that “AI is more dangerous than, say, mismanaged aircraft design or production maintenance
                          or bad car production.” “In the sense that it has the potential — however small one may regard that
                          probability, but it is non-trivial — it has the potential of civilization destruction,” he said.
                          Musk was a co-founder of OpenAI, one of the leading artificial intelligence firms, but left the
                          company in 2018 after a reported internal power struggle. He has reportedly sought to build a rival
                          to OpenAI, recruiting artificial intelligence engineers for a new venture for months.

                          was dissolved as a company this week and was replaced by a new company Musk calls X. The move is
                          seen as an attempt to build a social media platform that also allows payments, turning it into “the
                          everything app,” akin to how apps like WeChat work in China. Twitter announced this week it was
                          partnering with eToro to allow users to be able to trade stocks and crypto. It should be pretty
                          clear by now that Musk’s call for a six-month pause was purely out of self interest in the AI arms
                          race, as I wrote at the time. ChatGPT has become a fascinating tool for people who want to
                          experiment with large language models (LLMs) that answer questions posed in natural language. But
                          there are still a lot of kinks to be worked out, as ChatGPT will often give confident answers, even
                          when it’s wrong. AI is largely a magic trick at this point, sometimes spouting nonsense that users
                          may not know enough about to fact-check. But it’s an interesting magic trick and it’s something
                          that will improved upon as more people in the world of tech become involved. Musk must know he’s
                          behind in the most exciting development on the web since social media went mainstream in the late
                          2000s. But the billionaire clearly doesn’t intend to stay behind for long.

                          complete AI development pause, citing “risks to society” he says the technology poses. “Recent
                          months have seen AI labs locked in an out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful
                          digital minds that no one – not even their creators – can understand, predict, or reliably
                          control,” a group of tech experts including Musk said in an open letter calling for the development
                          pause last month. In an interview with Fox News’s Tucker Carlson that will air next week, Musk
                          warned that “AI is more dangerous than, say, mismanaged aircraft design or production maintenance
                          or bad car production.” “In the sense that it has the potential — however small one may regard that
                          probability, but it is non-trivial — it has the potential of civilization destruction,” he said.
                          Musk was a co-founder of OpenAI, one of the leading artificial intelligence firms, but left the
                          company in 2018 after a reported internal power struggle. He has reportedly sought to build a rival
                          to OpenAI, recruiting artificial intelligence engineers for a new venture for months.

Question 270              : Who won the Virginia Tech spring game 2023?
Correct Answers         :  
                          The maroon squad

                          Filed under: It’s the middle of April, the big Hokie Hi weekend has passed, and the biggest of the
                          big campus celebration events was the Spring Football Game. There were lots of things to look at
                          and analyze but for now, here are some shots and comments from the game. GO HOKIES!!! The crowd was
                          easily over 20,000 people. Hokie Hi weekend featured Friday and Saturday celebrations with an
                          evening tribute to the fallen 32 from April 16th 2007. The morning on Saturday was the 3.2 mile Run
                          and Walk for Remembrance, and the crowd there was estimated to be 15,000 or so. The weather in
                          Blacksburg not only cooperated, it assisted by being comfortably warm, without being hot, and a
                          light breeze was blowing. It was a magnificent way to honor the fallen and celebrate their memories
                          as Hokies. The Maroon Squad Offense was obviously mostly #1s int he depth chart, with Grant Wells
                          starting at Maroon Squad QB. He’d remain there for the first half. We’ll talk about the various
                          observations in a coming article, but overall, he did well and seemed like he was much more
                          comfortable than he was last season. We’ll take that as a major plus, for now.

                          qualities of teacher leadership that are the bedrock of schools that set high expectations for
                          students while providing the critical support they need to succeed. “Every school needs a Mrs.

                          happen for the better in her school. I look forward to the contributions she’ll be making across

                          the entire website a retail experience.[66][67] Jobs believed the Apple retail program needed to

                          headed by Allen Moyer from The Walt Disney Company then began a series of mock-ups for the Apple
                          Store inside a warehouse near the company's Cupertino headquarters.[4] On May 15, 2001, Jobs hosted
                          a press event at Apple's first store, located at the Tysons Corner Center mall in Tysons, Virginia,
                          near Washington, D.C.[70] The store officially opened on May 19, along with another store in
                          Glendale Galleria in Glendale, California.[70][4][71] More than 7,700 people visited Apple's first
                          two stores in the opening weekend, spending a total of US$599,000.[72] Several publications and
                          analysts predicted the failure of Apple Stores.

                          Sundar Pichai received $226 million in total compensation in 2022, most of which came through stock
                          awards, according to a securities report filed by the company on Friday. Pichai was awarded $218
                          million in equities last year through a triennial stock grant. His annual salary was $2 million
                          from 2020 to 2022, the filing stated. The CEO's compensation package also included almost $6
                          million for personal security in 2022. Other Alphabet and Google principal executives made
                          approximately $22 million to $35 million in annual stock awards, according to the filing. The
                          report comes as Alphabet is initiating cost restructuring measures, including layoffs in January
                          that eliminated 12,000 workers, or 6% of its workforce.

                          So, so much AI Google I/O 2023 was held on May 10. While many of the talks and presentations at I/O
                          are developer focused, the event started, as always, with a flashy keynote address to let us all
                          know what Google's been up to lately. This year, that includes both hardware and software — and, as
                          you might imagine, lots and lots of talk about AI. Here's everything you need to know. At I/O,
                          Google not only fully revealed its next midrange phone, the Pixel 7a, but also surprise-announced
                          that the phone is available to purchase — not preorder — right now, for $499. The phone shares a
                          lot of DNA with the $600 Pixel 7, including its Tensor G2 chipset, eight gigs of RAM, and design,
                          which is nearly indistinguishable from its more expensive cousin. If you're interested to learn
                          more, we've got a full review for you to check out. Interestingly, the Pixel 6a will remain on
                          offer at a lower price point: $350. As anticipated, Google showed off its first foldable at I/O
                          this year. The Pixel Fold's got a refreshingly normal-looking 5.8" screen on the outside and a 7.6"
                          display (with some pretty substantial bezels) on the inside.

                          The company unveiled the much-rumored Pixel Fold and Pixel 7a at the May 2023 event and revealed an
                          update to the previously announced Pixel Tablet. The Google Pixel Tablet features Google Tensor G2,
                          a chip that uses AI to provide you with a personalized experience; it comes as a package with a
                          charging speaker dock. Google Pixel Fold, which has a 7.6-inch display when unfolded, is also
                          outfitted with Google Tensor G2 and adapts to how you want to use it. The 2023 Google I/O event
                          also focused heavily on integrating generative AI into Google's existing products and LLM-driven
                          new apps and functionalities. In addition to Smart Reply and Smart Compose, Gmail will have a Help
                          Me Write feature that helps you write complete emails in just a few seconds. Google Maps now
                          includes an immersive view for route previews by bike, car, or on foot. Google Photos offers a
                          Magic Editor with advanced editing capabilities to remove unwanted objects from images, change
                          backgrounds, and even center out-of-frame images. Now that Google has ended the wait list for its
                          LLM, Bard is freely available. Google has improved Bard with new features that let you export text

                          So, so much AI Google I/O 2023 was held on May 10. While many of the talks and presentations at I/O
                          are developer focused, the event started, as always, with a flashy keynote address to let us all
                          know what Google's been up to lately. This year, that includes both hardware and software — and, as
                          you might imagine, lots and lots of talk about AI. Here's everything you need to know. At I/O,
                          Google not only fully revealed its next midrange phone, the Pixel 7a, but also surprise-announced
                          that the phone is available to purchase — not preorder — right now, for $499. The phone shares a
                          lot of DNA with the $600 Pixel 7, including its Tensor G2 chipset, eight gigs of RAM, and design,
                          which is nearly indistinguishable from its more expensive cousin. If you're interested to learn
                          more, we've got a full review for you to check out. Interestingly, the Pixel 6a will remain on
                          offer at a lower price point: $350. As anticipated, Google showed off its first foldable at I/O
                          this year. The Pixel Fold's got a refreshingly normal-looking 5.8" screen on the outside and a 7.6"
                          display (with some pretty substantial bezels) on the inside.

                          emotionally exhausting performance in Suzie Miller’s one-woman legal thriller “Prima Facie,” versus
                          Jessica Chastain, who scarcely stirs from her chair during the entirety of “A Doll’s House.” In the

                          accused of sexual assault. Jesse Green, the chief theater critic for The New York Times, described
                          it as “a performance of tremendous skill and improbable stamina.” It was a remarkable win for the

                          won it for her first performance on a major stage. “It kind of felt unattainable,” she told The

                          Dating apps, meanwhile, still require a level of manual work (swiping, messaging, responding) that
                          can become cumbersome and exhausting. That is what drove Dmitri Mirakyan, 28, a data scientist in
                          New York, to develop YourMove.ai, an AI dating tool that helps users begin and respond to messages.
                          “This past summer, I got really tired of sifting through and trying to come up with responses on
                          dating apps,” he said. “So I tried to see if GPT3 could flirt. It turns out it could. A month
                          later, I built the first version [of the platform] on a Saturday.” Unlike Rizz and a similar app
                          called Keys, Your Move does not yet plug into a user’s keyboard, and you must enter messages
                          manually and it will generate a response. However, Mirakyan says a keyboard update is coming soon.
                          Mirakyan said that he has always struggled with social interaction and reading social cues, and
                          that he built the app for those like him who need help making digital communication seamless.
                          “There’s such a gap currently in what people like myself want to communicate and how it comes
                          across,” he said. “Just trying to be honest or communicate a point [can mean] not reading the room
                          or stumbling over ourselves.” Users across the country are embracing the app’s ability to generate

                          Mirakyan's interest in an app like his, however, seems to go deeper than Lloyd's term paper
                          comparison. Speaking to WaPo, he explained that he's always had a difficult time reading social
                          cues — a dating stressor that a tool like YourMove.ai helps to alleviate. "There's such a gap
                          currently," he told the newspaper, "in what people like myself want to communicate and how it comes
                          across." That's sympathetic, in a sense, and we could see how AI assistance might benefit folks who
                          have a tough time socially. At the same time, however, balance is definitely still needed here.
                          Romance is one of the most human things out there, and the digital dating world is robotic enough
                          as it is. Do we really want everyone on the apps just passing AI-generated quips and complements
                          back and forth for eternity? That's starting to sound like The Sims — and as humans, maybe we

                          Here's a breakdown all the main characters and their voice actors in Star Wars Jedi: Survivor. Star
                          Wars Jedi: Survivor is a sequel that features both new and returning characters, with all the
                          returning characters being reprised by their original voice actors or actresses. With the Star Wars
                          game being, well, Star Wars, the title has pulled some major names from both the acting and video
                          game rosters of talent, and some of the voices may yet surprise players when learning who or what
                          voice they recognize in the game. RELATED: Star Wars Jedi: Survivor - 10 Best Outfits, Ranked
                          Speaking to the overall quality of the Star Wars Jedi titles, the acting, motion capture, and
                          writing are all very well executed. So to get some info on the voices and characters behind the

                          Jedi: Survivor. Richard Steven has been a professional voice actor for many decades but is probably
                          best known as the voice of Alpha 5 in Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers. Perfectly cast as the cartoony
                          character Turgle in Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, Horvitz's zany performance gives levity to a game
                          that can be heavy and have a darker tone. Turgle can be found on the planet of Koboh and, without
                          giving too much away, players will end up feeling one way or another about Turgle in their
                          playthrough.

                          Manzoor lists directors Mira Nair (The Namesake) and Deepa Mehta (Elements trilogy) as two people
                          who inspire her, since they feature South Asian women in their projects. "It made me believe that
                          our stories are worth being told," Manzoor says, noting that she also looks up to Pedro Almodóvar.
                          "He centered women in a way that I hadn't experienced before." Tamara Jenkins' 1998 debut film
                          Slums of Beverly Hills, which is about a teenage girl struggling to grow up in a lower-middle-class
                          nomadic Jewish family that relocates every few months, made Manzoor feel seen as a teenager. "Each
                          of her movies expresses a real truth of womanhood and there's a rawness to her work that I
                          gravitate to," she explains. In addition to Slums of Beverly Hills, Jenkins directed The Savages
                          and Private Life. Since Manzoor is focused on telling women-centric tales, it makes sense that Jane
                          Austen's works have always resonated with her. "There's something in the way she explores the
                          pressure of society and being a woman who wants to strike out on her own," she says. Polite Society
                          is in theaters now.

                          The Chinese city of Chengdu will be the host city for The World Games 2025. On Thursday 9 May, in
                          Gold Coast, Australia, the Mayor of Chengdu, Mr Luo Qiang, signed the Organiser Agreement for the
                          12th edition of the multi-sports event. The Vice President of IOC and the Chinese Olympic
                          Committee, Mr Yu Zaiqing, signed the agreement as Witness. President Jose Perurena signed on behalf
                          of the International World Games Association. This was preceded by ratification of the contract by
                          the 37 member federations of the IWGA during the Annual General Meeting at the SportAccord
                          Convention in Gold Coast. Chengdu follows the city of Birmingham, Alabama as host. The 11th edition
                          of The World Games will take place there from 15 to 25 July 2021. Jose Perurena said at a press
                          briefing afterwards: “By signing a contract with one of the most forward-looking and dynamic cities
                          in China, we have signalled our arrival as a major power in international sport.” The IWGA
                          President added: ”Following our 2021 event in another great country, the USA, we are excited now to
                          start work with our Chinese partners on plans for 2025.” Chengdu Mayor, Mr Luo Qiang, said:
                          "Chengdu highly appreciates the concept of the IWGA and believe that it is in line with Chengdu's
                          development philosophy.

                          competes for the title of Ultimate Firefighter at the World Police and Fire Games. The
                          international competition is set to come to Birmingham in 2025. The Magic City will host the World
                          Police and Fire Games (WPFG), an event featuring more than 10,000 first responders competing in
                          1,600 medal events, from June 27 to July 6, 2025. The city’s successful bid for the event was
                          announced in May by local officials and The World Police and Fire Games Federation. “From the
                          beginning, we were impressed by all that Birmingham has to offer,” said LC Collins, president of
                          the WPFG. “We believe that this city is the whole package – from its venues, infrastructure and
                          history of hosting major events, to its entertainment, dining and attractions." The decision comes
                          following a presentation to the Federation’s Board of Directors by the Birmingham Bid Committee,
                          which was led by the Greater Birmingham Convention and Visitors Bureau, the city of Birmingham and
                          Jefferson County. The games are “expected to have an economic impact of $75 million on the
                          Birmingham region and will showcase our home to over 150,000 people between athletes, supporters
                          and spectators,” said Jefferson County Commissioner Steve Ammons. Events will be hosted at more
                          than 35 venues around the city and will be free and open for all spectators.

Question 287              : When was Pixel Fold announced?

  - Source              :
                          For charging, the Pixel Fold supports 21W wired speeds. However, you’ll have to purchase Google’s
                          30W power adapter ($25 at Google Store) separately. The phone also supports wireless charging at up
                          to 7.5W and will work with any Qi wireless charger. No. Furthermore, the Google Pixel does not
                          support pen/stylus input. The Pixel Fold’s inner display is protected by Ultra Thin Glass, complete
                          with a protective plastic layer applied. Gorilla Glass Victus protects the external display. Yes.
                          The Google Pixel Fold has an IPX8 certification, which means it can be submerged in up to 1.5
                          meters of freshwater for up to 30 minutes. No, Google no longer includes chargers with its
                          smartphones. You’ll have to buy a compatible charger that supports USB Power Delivery PPS. The
                          Google Pixel Fold supports dual SIMs. One is a nano-SIM slot, and the second is via eSIM. The Pixel
                          Fold was announced on May 10, 2023. General availability of the phone will commence in June 2023.
                          Folding phones are great for those who want a large-screen device but don’t want the size penalty
                          of carrying a tablet. Based on our hands-on experience, the Pixel Fold should also be a great
                          traditional handset when folded. There’s no indication that Google is working on a second, smaller
                          flip phone to partner the Pixel Fold or challenge the Galaxy Z Flip series.

                          Google's first foldable phone isn't coming for a few more weeks. The Google Pixel Fold is on
                          preorder at AT&T and Verizon. Google's Pixel Fold is nearing its release, but there may be a bit of
                          a delay. After being announced at Google I/O in May, Google's first foldable is just now getting
                          some release updates, this time from AT&T and Verizon. On Tuesday, AT&T announced that it will
                          begin its own preorders for the Pixel Fold and introduced a deal that offered new and existing AT&T
                          users the Pixel Fold for $25 per month without needing to trade in a device. To get that discount
                          you will need to be on an unlimited plan and commit to a 36-month installment plan. All told, the
                          carrier is willing to cover $900, or half of the Pixel Fold's regular $1,799 starting price for the
                          256GB model (not including taxes). Oddly, purchasing the 256GB model outright from the carrier is
                          $1,880, or $81more than the unlocked version you could buy directly from Google. Verizon previously
                          said it would begin accepting preorders for the foldable on June 20, and said the device would go
                          on sale on June 27.

                          budget-friendly Pixel 7a, Google’s first folding handset is finally here. The highly-anticipated
                          Pixel Fold will compete for your attention in a quickly crowding foldable phones market of which
                          Samsung is currently king. Here’s everything you need to know about the Google Pixel Fold. Google
                          officially unveiled the Pixel Fold at Google I/O on March 10, 2023. It comes in two colors —
                          Obsidian and Porcelain. You can also choose between three official Pixel Fold cases that come in
                          Hazel, Porcelain, and Bay colors (pictured above). Google is charging a similar price to the rival
                          Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4. The 256GB variant of the Pixel Fold will cost you a whopping $1,799. The
                          512GB version is even more expensive at $1,919, which seems costly for Google’s first attempt at a
                          foldable phone. Google hopes you buy the foldable Pixel for its thin form factor, “true pocket
                          size,” loaded camera features, “all-day battery,” multi-tasking skills, and long-lasting software
                          support. However, we’ll only know if it justifies that price when we review the device. As for
                          availability, Google is not casting a very wide net for the Pixel Fold. The handset will only sell
                          in the US, UK, Germany, and Japan, at least to start with.

Question 288              : What is the name of Google's foldable smartphone?
Correct Answers         :  
                          Pixel Fold
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                          Google (GOOG, GOOGL) debuted its Pixel Fold smartphone at its annual I/O developers conference in
                          Mountain View, CA. on Wednesday. The phone, which—hold your breath—will cost $1,799, is Google’s
                          first foldable handset, and its first ultra premium device. The company also revealed its low-cost
                          Pixel 7A at the show. Like Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 4, the Pixel Fold opens up like a book, allowing
                          users to take advantage of its front display, or its larger tablet-like inner screen. Google says
                          the Pixel Fold’s 5.8-inch external display should feel just like a standard smartphone screen
                          whether surfing the web or checking TikTok. That would be a sharp contrast from Samsung’s Z Fold,
                          which uses a larger, though thinner 6.2-inch outer screen that can feel cramped while doing things
                          like typing messages. Inside, the Pixel Fold gets a 7.6-inch panel that folds directly down its
                          center line. The Z Fold packs a similar internal display, though it looks as though Samsung’s
                          offering has thinner bezels around its inner screen. Google also claims that the Pixel Fold is the
                          thinnest foldable on the market whether folded or unfolded. That should come as a relief to
                          consumers who’ve balked at Samsung’s bulky Z Fold’s design.

                          Google is also banking on two more conventional devices as it attempts again to make headway in the
                          hardware market. The Pixel 7a looks like last year’s Pixel 7, but uses more basic components and
                          trims back the list of features. Its screen is 25% brighter than the preceding model and has a
                          faster, 90-hertz refresh rate. There’s also face unlock, enhanced camera zoom, and a 64-megapixel
                          rear camera, making it one of the more compelling low-end smartphones. A year after announcing the
                          product, Google shared more details about its tablet. The device’s specifications — including the
                          company’s G2 processor, 128GB of storage, 8MP front and rear cameras and hardware design — are by
                          this point dated compared with rival devices. Its price — $499 — also eclipses some iPad models,
                          though the Google device includes a home dock to stand it upright. While docked, the device will be
                          geared toward video watching, controlling appliances and viewing photo slideshows. © 2023 Fortune

                          market remains red hot. That's great for workers, but it's bound to reinforce concerns about high
                          inflation. Hiring surged last month as U.S. employers added 339,000 jobs, far above expectations,
                          according to a report from the Labor Department on Friday. The job gains for March and April were
                          also stronger than previously reported. The April jobs figure was revised up by 41,000, while the
                          March number was revised up by 52,000. The strong jobs numbers indicate the U.S. jobs engine
                          continues to chug along, with substantial hiring in business services, health care and hospitality.
                          Construction companies added 25,000 jobs last month even as high interest rates have weighed on the
                          housing market. The unemployment rate, which is compiled from a separate survey, paints a less rosy
                          picture. Unemployment, which been at a half century low, inched up in May to 3.7%.

                          Unemployment remains low and hiring eases as more workers enter the labor force. Key points:
                          There’s good news for every audience in this jobs report. Workers will be happy that unemployment
                          remains low, and those out of work are still able to find jobs quickly. Employers will be pleased
                          that labor force participation continues to grow, particularly for prime-age workers. And
                          policymakers at the Federal Reserve will be comforted by the gradual cooldown in the pace of
                          hiring. The US labor market is on a smooth trajectory, but turmoil in the financial market could
                          cause turbulence. This labor market continues to work for workers. Unemployment is very low, but
                          the continued progress in enticing people into the workforce is perhaps more encouraging. The labor
                          force participation rate for workers ages 25 to 54 hit a level previously seen in March 2008, and
                          the last time the employment rate for these workers was this high was May 2001. The number of
                          workers who were unemployed because they had recently lost a job dropped in April, reversing a
                          concerning rise seen in recent months. Payroll job gains continued to moderate, with the
                          three-month moving average ticking down to 222,000 in April, less than half of what it was a year
                          ago. The slowing job gains might concern some people, but this rate of growth is well above the
                          level needed to keep the unemployment rate steady. Furthermore, the slowdown in hiring will
                          encourage monetary policymakers that the labor market continues to shift into a better balance.

                          According to Alan Cooper, the "Father of Visual Basic", the concept of Clippit was based on a
                          "tragic misunderstanding" of research conducted at Stanford University, showing that the same part
                          of the brain in use while using a mouse or keyboard was also responsible for emotional reactions
                          while interacting with other human beings and thus is the reason people yell at their computer
                          monitors.[11] Microsoft concluded that if humans reacted to computers the same way they react to
                          other humans, it would be beneficial to include a human-like face in their software.[11] As people
                          already related to computers directly as they do with humans, the added human-like face emerged as
                          an annoying interloper distracting the user from the primary conversation.[11] First introduced in
                          Microsoft Office 97,[12] the Office Assistant was codenamed TFC during development.[13] It appeared
                          when the program determined the user could be assisted by using Office wizards, searching help, or
                          advising users on using Office features more effectively. It also presented tips and keyboard
                          shortcuts. For example, typing an address followed by "Dear" would cause the Assistant to appear
                          with the message, "It looks like you're writing a letter. Would you like help?" Microsoft turned
                          off the feature by default in Office XP.[14] The feature was removed altogether in Office 2007 and
                          Office 2008 for Mac.

Question 292              : What is the name of Google's AI image editing tool?
Correct Answers         :  
                          Magic Editor
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prediction (only positive):
  - Answer              : Magic Editor
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          By Jay Peters, a news editor who writes about technology, video games, and virtual worlds. He’s
                          submitted several accepted emoji proposals to the Unicode Consortium. Google’s latest Photos trick
                          is a feature it’s calling Magic Editor, which uses generative AI to let you make major edits to a
                          photo without professional tools. The company revealed the feature at Google I/O 2023. Google
                          shared a couple examples of Magic Editor in action that are both pretty cool. In one, a photo of a
                          person in front of a waterfall, Google entirely moves the person further to the side of the photo,
                          erases people in the background, and makes the sky a prettier blue. Watch this GIF to see it all
                          happen: In another photo, Magic Editor scoots a child on a bench closer to the middle of the photo,
                          which generates “new” parts of the bench and balloons to the left to fill in the space. In this
                          example, Google again makes the sky more vibrant. Check it out in this GIF: It’s impressive stuff —
                          and a logical next step from photo features like Photo Unblur and Magic Eraser. It’s also not quite
                          perfect given leftover artifacts like creases from the bag strap in the waterfall photo and a
                          misplaced shadow under the bench in the second.

  - Source              :
                          The draft is conducted under the eligibility rules established in the league's 2017 collective
                          bargaining agreement (CBA) with its players' union, with special modifications agreed to by both
                          parties due to disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The previous CBA that ended the 2011
                          lockout instituted no immediate changes to the draft, but it called for a committee of owners and
                          players to discuss further charges. Players who were not automatically eligible had to declare
                          their eligibility for the draft by notifying the NBA offices in writing no later than at least 60
                          days before the event. For the 2023 draft, the date fell on April 23. Under the CBA a player may
                          withdraw his name from consideration from the draft at any time before the final declaration
                          deadline, which usually falls 10 days before the draft at 5:00 pm EDT (2100 UTC). Under current
                          NCAA rules, players usually have until 10 days after the draft combine to withdraw from the draft
                          and retain college eligibility. They must have withdrawn on or before May 31, 22 days prior to this
                          draft.[70] A player who has hired an agent retains his remaining college eligibility regardless of
                          whether he is drafted after an evaluation from the NBA Undergraduate Advisory Committee. Players
                          who declare for the NBA draft and are not selected have the opportunity to return to their school
                          for at least another year only after terminating all agreements with their agents, who must have
                          been certified.[73]

Question 296              : What is the name of Apple's headset?
Correct Answers         :  
                          Vision Pro

                          Design wise, Apple Vision Pro is not unlike a pair of ski goggles, featuring a singular piece of
                          laminated glass for the front that melds into an aluminum alloy frame. A soft, fitted Light Seal
                          attaches magnetically to the frame and conforms to your face to block out light. Two Audio Straps
                          with built-in speakers are positioned at the sides of the headset, delivering Spatial Audio that
                          blends what you're hearing on the headset with what's going on in the real world. The Audio Straps
                          connect to a 3D knitted headband that holds the Vision Pro in place. Apple designed it to be
                          breathable, cushiony, and stretchy for comfort, and a Fit Dial ensures the headset fits tight
                          against your head. Apple plans to offer Light Seals and headbands in multiple sizes, and these
                          components are swappable. Inside the frame, there are two micro-OLED displays that deliver over 4K
                          resolution to each eye for a total of 23 million pixels. There's also an external display called
                          EyeSight that projects an image of your eyes so people can tell whether you're using the headset in
                          an immersive mode or if you can see what's going on around you. For glasses wearers, there are
                          custom prescription Zeiss Optical Inserts that can be attached magnetically to the headset's
                          lenses. playSubscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel for more videos.

                          According to Kuo, the lenses will bring electronics from the era of "visible computing" to
                          "invisible computing." There is "no visibility" for the contact lenses at the current time, and
                          it's not a guaranteed product that Apple will develop. Apple was also developing augmented reality
                          "Apple Glasses" that were supposed to launch a year or so after the headset, but the project has
                          been placed on hold so the company can instead focus on a cheaper version of the AR/VR headset.
                          Apple Glasses are expected to launch in 2027 at the earliest. A future version of the AR/VR headset
                          could have accessibility settings that are designed to help people who suffer from eye diseases and

                          in Minnesota.[1] She attended the University of Michigan as part of the LSA Honors program, where
                          she double majored in English and Political Science. She obtained a bachelor's degree.[4] After
                          graduating, Ryder moved to Spain to teach English in the public school system.[1] She later
                          attended the London School of Economics and earned a master's degree in anthropology.[2] Ryder
                          later wrote for The Economist from Southeast Asia, New York and London, and also for The New Yorker
                          and The Wall Street Journal.[1][5] In 2009, she also helped former U.S. Treasury Secretary Hank
                          Paulson write his memoirs, On The Brink.[6][7] She moved to London from Singapore in 2011.[4][1] In

                          child rearing while balancing careers gave her the idea of a startup to improve healthcare for

                          He then finished his round by making a 22-foot putt for birdie on the 18th to get to seven-under
                          for the tournament and end up alone in fourth place.[22] Sunday, June 18, 2023 Wyndham Clark shot
                          an even-par 70 to win his first career U.S. Open and major championship.[23] Beginning the round
                          tied with Rickie Fowler for the lead, he hit his approach shot on the par-3 fourth hole to five
                          feet for a birdie to get to 11-under and take sole possession of the lead. He also birdied the
                          par-4 sixth hole from the rough just short of the green, but at the eighth hole hit his second shot
                          into the rough to the left of the green. He failed to advance the ball on his third shot and ended
                          up with a bogey on the par-five.[24] With a two-shot lead playing the par-5 14th hole, Clark found
                          the green in two shots and two-putted from 20 feet for a birdie to get to 12-under and open up a
                          three-shot lead with four holes to play. He hit his tee shot on the par-3 15th over the green and
                          failed to get up and down, settling for a bogey, then drove into a bunker on the 16th and had to
                          chip back into the fairway.

                          He then finished his round by making a 22-foot putt for birdie on the 18th to get to seven-under
                          for the tournament and end up alone in fourth place.[22] Sunday, June 18, 2023 Wyndham Clark shot
                          an even-par 70 to win his first career U.S. Open and major championship.[23] Beginning the round
                          tied with Rickie Fowler for the lead, he hit his approach shot on the par-3 fourth hole to five
                          feet for a birdie to get to 11-under and take sole possession of the lead. He also birdied the
                          par-4 sixth hole from the rough just short of the green, but at the eighth hole hit his second shot
                          into the rough to the left of the green. He failed to advance the ball on his third shot and ended
                          up with a bogey on the par-five.[24] With a two-shot lead playing the par-5 14th hole, Clark found
                          the green in two shots and two-putted from 20 feet for a birdie to get to 12-under and open up a
                          three-shot lead with four holes to play. He hit his tee shot on the par-3 15th over the green and
                          failed to get up and down, settling for a bogey, then drove into a bunker on the 16th and had to
                          chip back into the fairway.

                          Montana in December 2014, he hired Semore first as safeties coach and special-teams coordinator and
                          then moved him up to defensive coordinator. “He really relates well to the players, and he just has

                          also was at Oklahoma State where Gundy gave him his nickname, Boogie. It had nothing to do with
                          Semore; it was the nickname of an assistant who had just left the team. “It was probably because he

                          Thacker helped bring him to Temple in 2018 as a defensive analyst, and Collins brought him to Tech
                          for a similar position that he held before taking a defensive coordinator job at Division II

                          steadily been increasing. In 2014, the company made only 35,000 vehicles. In the first half of
                          2021, Tesla produced 386,759 cars, with 184,877 vehicles delivered in Q1 and 201,304 in Q2.
                          Overall, in 2021, Tesla produced 930,422 EVs and delivered 936,222, thereby setting a new record.
                          Compared to 2020, these numbers suggest a year-over-year growth of 82.5%. There were 906,032 Model
                          3/Y vehicles produced, which constituted a growth of 99%, compared to 2020. In the same year, Tesla

                          is gaining popularity in Europe. In 2021, it sold 169,507 vehicles in European countries, where the
                          Tesla Model 3 was named Europe’s favorite electric vehicle. In 2019, the Netherlands bought the
                          largest number of Tesla cars among European countries – 30,911 vehicles. Norway and Germany

                          vehicles, arriving at the end of its government subsidy cap of $,5000 per sold car. In other words,
                          since January 2020, no Tesla vehicle sold in the USA has received any subsidy. The annual sales of
                          Tesla vehicles in the US were as follows: Tesla started the production of its vehicles in China in
                          2018. In January 2020, Tesla’s Chinese Gigafactory started the output of the Tesla Model 3 Sedan
                          and batteries. The production of the Tesla Model Y began on the Chinese mainland in 2021.

Question 7              : Where is the Super Bowl held in 2022?
Correct Answers         :

  - Source              :
                          Super Bowl LVI[12] was an American football game played to determine the champion of the National
                          Football League (NFL) for the 2021 season. The National Football Conference (NFC) champion Los
                          Angeles Rams defeated the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Cincinnati Bengals, 23–20.
                          The game was played on February 13, 2022, at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, the home
                          stadium of the Rams, marking the second consecutive and second overall Super Bowl with a team
                          playing and winning in its home stadium.[13][14][15][16] The Rams' victory was their second, first
                          as a Los Angeles-based team, and first since winning 1999's Super Bowl XXXIV when they were based
                          in St. Louis. Finishing with a 12–5 record, the Rams reached their fifth appearance after acquiring
                          veteran quarterback Matthew Stafford, who had not won a playoff game in his previous 12 years with
                          the Detroit Lions. The Bengals, who finished with a 10–7 record, were seeking their first Super
                          Bowl title following several decades of losing seasons and playoff struggles. They won their first
                          playoff game since 1990, ending the longest drought in the four major North American sports, en
                          route to their third Super Bowl appearance and first since 1988's Super Bowl XXIII.

                          MORE SUPER BOWL: Halftime show | Ticket prices | Commercials The Super Bowl will take place on
                          Sunday, Feb. 13, 2022. It marks the first time since 2003 that the Super Bowl has not been held on
                          the first Sunday in February. Because of the NFL's expanded, 17-game, 18-week schedule, it will be
                          held on the second Sunday in February. This is the latest that a Super Bowl has ever been held.
                          Super Bowls 44, 50 and 55 all were held on Feb. 7, which was previously the record for the latest
                          Super Bowl. Under the NFL's new format, the latest date on which a Super Bowl can occur is Feb. 14.
                          NBC is set to broadcast the Super Bowl. Al Michael, Cris Collinsworth and the rest of the "Sunday
                          Night Football" crew will presumably broadcast the event. NBC's last Super Bowl broadcast came in
                          2019, when Tom Brady's Patriots beat Jared Goff's Rams 13-3. SoFi Stadium — the home of the Rams
                          and the Chargers — will host the Super Bowl in 2022. Originally, the new stadium, which opened in
                          2020, was scheduled to host the Super Bowl in 2021. However, weather-related construction delays
                          caused the league to move the 2021 Super Bowl to Raymond James Stadium in Tampa Bay, Fla. and the
                          2022 Super Bowl to Los Angeles.

                          However, in order to avoid counterprogramming the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing—which are
                          televised exclusively by NBC—the NFL announced on March 13, 2019, that NBC had agreed to swap
                          2021's Super Bowl LV to CBS in exchange for Super Bowl LVI. Such a swap out of the normal rotation
                          was done before when CBS was given Super Bowl XXVI in January 1992 after it acquired the rights to
                          the 1992 Winter Olympics (which started 13 days later), and NBC then aired Super Bowl XXVII and
                          Super Bowl XXVIII in the next two consecutive years. NBC also aired Super Bowl LII in February
                          2018, under the normal Super Bowl cycle, a few days before it began its coverage of the 2018 Winter
                          Olympics. In all the other previous Winter Olympics years, the league stuck to the normal broadcast
                          cycle regardless of which network was broadcasting the Olympics. However, Super Bowl LVI was the
                          first Super Bowl to actually occur when the Winter Olympics were already underway: primetime
                          coverage of the Olympics would have had to compete with the Super Bowl—diluting viewership and
                          advertising revenue for CBS and NBC,[117][118] and there is an unsaid gentleman's agreement between
                          the NFL's broadcasters to not air competing original programming against the Super Bowl.

                          Store's top charts.[99][100] Due to an extensive backlog of applicants, upon downloading the app,

                          waitlisted.[101][102][103] The app was installed 872,000 times during its first week, but a month

Question 13              : How much is Microsoft acquiring Activision Blizzard for?

                          what’s new Microsoft is attempting to persuade regulators around the world to clear its $68.7
                          billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard — the biggest deal of its kind the gaming industry has
                          ever seen. Amid concerns about its effect on competition in the industry — particularly in the
                          nascent cloud gaming market — and in the face of ardent lobbying against the deal by competitor
                          Sony, the U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority first decided to block the acquisition, then
                          agreed to further talks with Microsoft and Activision. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has
                          withdrawn its attempt block the deal legally after a federal judge ruled in favor of Microsoft
                          being allowed to close the deal. The European Union, meanwhile, has given the deal its seal of
                          approval. Here’s the latest on Microsoft’s plans to snap up Activision Blizzard. According to
                          Reuters and Bloomberg, the Federal Trade Commission has withdrawn its administrative case against
                          Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard, which was due to go before an in-house judge in
                          August. Microsoft and Activision had requested the case be withdrawn after the FTC lost its case
                          arguing for a block on the deal in district court, and was denied an extension of a temporary block
                          by an appeals court. The move means Microsoft and Activision can now try to persuade the U.S.
                          antitrust regulator to accept a settlement.

                          Prize for Social Courage. The Ivan Allen Jr. Prize for Social Courage was established in 2010 to

                          inaugural prize was awarded in March 2011. It recognizes exemplary, courageous leaders — those who,
                          like Mayor Allen, take on personal risks in an effort to improve the lives of others,” said Georgia

                          that Black students had the right to study at Georgia Tech, paving the way for the thousands of

  - Source              :
                          12] In January 2022, The Verge reported that Google was building an AR headset which used
                          "outward-facing cameras to blend computer graphics with a video feed of the real world", internally
                          codenamed Project Iris and being developed in a highly secretive and secure facility located in the
                          San Francisco Bay Area. Overseen by Bavor, the headset was to be powered by the Android operating
                          system as well as a custom system on a chip akin to Tensor, expected to launch in 2024 alongside
                          Project Starline. Other key people named as part of the project include Shahram Izadi, Eddie Chung,
                          Scott Huffman, Kurt Akeley, and Lucovsky.[13] An early prototype of the headset bore a close
                          resemblance to the North Focals.[14] In March, The Information reported that Google would acquire
                          Raxium, an AR hardware startup, for approximately $1 billion, and would continue to make further
                          acquisitions to assist in their AR and mixed reality (MR) work.[15] The acquisition was completed a
                          month later.[16] In May 2022, Google unveiled a different version of Iris resembling eyeglasses
                          with live translation capabilities during the 2022 Google I/O keynote.[14][17][18] The company
                          began publicly testing these prototypes across the U.S. in August,[19] before expanding into Canada
                          in October.[20] According to Business Insider, Google executives' constantly changing strategy for
                          Project Iris frustrated employees.

                          manufacturing technology that will use the same silicon as the raw material for most processors for
                          manufacturing and will significantly reduce production costs. Currently, MicroLED technology is
                          mainly used only for wall-mounted signs and other large and expensive screens. In addition to
                          Google, many other hardware companies are also investing and developing in the MicroLED field. For
                          example, OPPO's Air Glass, which will be released at the end of 2021, is already equipped with
                          MicroLED technology. Apple acquired a MicroLED startup in 2014; Meta is currently working with
                          Plessey on MicroLED technology, and Samsung's MicroLED TVs are already on sale. In the AR device
                          space, Google has many competitors. In addition to rebranding the Oculus Quest as "Quest" and
                          launching the Quest 2 virtual reality headset, Meta is also working on a new AR device codenamed
                          "Project Cambria".

Question 18              : What is the name of Meta's AI supercomputer?
Correct Answers         :  
                          RSC, the AI Research SuperCluster
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prediction (only positive):
  - Answer              : RSC
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          Image Credits: Meta But beyond keeping up with the Joneses, Meta says that the RSC confers the
                          benefit of allowing its researchers to train models using real-world examples from Meta’s
                          production systems. That’s unlike the company’s previous AI infrastructure, which leveraged only
                          open source and publicly available datasets. “The RSC AI supercomputer is used for pushing the
                          boundaries of AI research in several domains, including generative AI,” a Meta spokesperson said.
                          “It’s really about AI research productivity. We wanted to provide AI researchers with a
                          state-of-the-art infrastructure for them to be able to develop models and empower them with a
                          training platform to advance AI.” At its peak, the RSC can reach nearly 5 exaflops of computing
                          power, which the company claims makes it among the world’s fastest. (Lest that impress, it’s worth
                          noting some experts view the exaflops performance metric with a pinch of salt and that the RSC is
                          far outgunned by many of the world’s fastest supercomputers.) Meta says that it used the RSC to
                          train LLaMA, a tortured acronym for “Large Language Model Meta AI” — a large language model that
                          the company shared as a “gated release” to researchers earlier in the year (and which subsequently
                          leaked in various internet communities). The largest LLaMA model was trained on 2,048 A100 GPUs,
                          Meta says, which took 21 days.

                          AI supercomputers and regular supercomputers can’t necessarily be compared apples to apples The
                          brief explanation is that machine learning requires less accuracy than the tasks put to traditional
                          supercomputers, and so “AI supercomputers” (a bit of recent branding) can carry out more
                          calculations per second than their regular brethren using the same hardware. That means when Meta
                          says it’s built the “world’s fastest AI supercomputer,” it’s not necessarily a direct comparison to
                          the supercomputers you often see in the news (rankings of which are compiled by the independent
                          Top500.org and published twice a year). To explain this a little more, you need to know that both
                          supercomputers and AI supercomputers make calculations using what is known as floating-point
                          arithmetic — a mathematical shorthand that’s extremely useful for making calculations using very
                          large and very small numbers (the “floating point” in question is the decimal point, which “floats”
                          between significant figures). The degree of accuracy deployed in floating-point calculations can be
                          adjusted based on different formats, and the speed of most supercomputers is calculated using what
                          are known as 64-bit floating-point operations per second, or FLOPs. However, because AI
                          calculations require less accuracy, AI supercomputers are often measured in 32-bit or even 16-bit
                          FLOPs.

                          go all-digital. Starting in 2023 for international students and in 2024 in the U.S., the new
                          digital SAT will shrink from three hours to two, include shorter reading passages and allow
                          students to use a calculator on the math section. Testing will still take place at a test center or
                          at a school, but students will be able to choose between using their own devices — including a
                          tablet or a laptop — or the schools' devices. "The digital SAT will be easier to take, easier to
                          give, and more relevant," said Priscilla Rodriguez of the College Board, the organization behind
                          the test. "With input from educators and students, we are adapting to ensure we continue to meet
                          their evolving needs." The College Board previously scrapped plans to offer an at-home digital test

                          power. Student broadband access has been a constant struggle throughout the pandemic, especially in
                          rural and low-income areas. The new SAT will be designed to autosave, so students won't lose work

                          test while also allowing students more time per question. This means that for the digital SAT
                          Suite, each test section (Reading and Writing, Math) is divided into two parts called modules.
                          Students answer a set of questions in the first module before moving on to the next. The questions
                          that students are given in the second module depend on how they performed on the first module.
                          Students will be able to practice with the new digital adaptive format starting this fall. Many
                          large-scale assessments use adaptive testing, and more than 30 years of research shows the benefits

                          Each team finished the regular season as their respective conference's 4-seed, making this the
                          first Super Bowl without a top-3 seed since seeding was introduced in 1975.[17] The game had three
                          lead changes and mostly kept within a one-possession margin. Los Angeles led 13–10 at halftime, but
                          the Bengals scored 10 straight points on their first two drives in the third quarter. Trailing
                          20–16 in the fourth, the Rams scored a touchdown to retake the lead with under two minutes
                          remaining and stopped Cincinnati's final drive on downs. Wide receiver Cooper Kupp, who converted a
                          fourth down on the Rams' final drive and scored the game-winning touchdown, was named Super Bowl
                          MVP. NBC's broadcast of Super Bowl LVI was the second-most watched in the game's history, marking a
                          shift from several years of declining ratings. Seen by an average of 112.3 million total viewers on
                          both NBC and its streaming platforms,[18] the game's ratings were up 8% from the previous Super
                          Bowl.[19] In contrast to most previous Super Bowls, no bids were accepted for Super Bowl LVI. The
                          bids for Super Bowl LIII, Super Bowl LIV and Super Bowl LV were all drawn from the same pool of

                          receive such an honor. October 05, 2022 LA JOLLA, CA—Scripps Research professor K. Barry Sharpless,
                          PhD, has been awarded the 2022 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his groundbreaking research in
                          developing “click chemistry,” an ingenious method for building molecules. Sharpless, the W.M. Keck
                          Professor of Chemistry, shares the prize with Carolyn R. Bertozzi, PhD, of Stanford University and
                          Morten Meldal, PhD, of the University of Copenhagen for the development of click chemistry and
                          bioorthogonal chemistry, according to the Nobel Prize committee. Sharpless previously shared the
                          2001 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on chirally catalyzed oxidation reactions, making him
                          the second scientist ever to win two Nobel Prizes in Chemistry. Frederick Sanger won the Nobel
                          Prize in Chemistry in 1958 and 1980. “Barry Sharpless has had a tremendous impact on chemistry,
                          first with his development of asymmetric synthesis and now with his elegant ‘click chemistry,’”
                          says Peter Schultz, PhD, President and CEO of Scripps Research. “His work opened whole new
                          scientific frontiers that have had a major impact on the fields of chemistry, biology and medicine.

                          “This has really opened up an immense amount of new space for scientists to study how different
                          living processes work and to watch those processes in action, even in real time,” said Dr. Lorsch,
                          whose organization has funded both Dr. Bertozzi’s and Dr. Sharpless’s research. During the award
                          announcement, Dr. Bertozzi, who joined remotely, acknowledged the potential of her and her fellow
                          laureates’ work. “The field of click chemistry is still in its early phases,” she said, adding that
                          there were “many new reactions to be discovered and invented,” as well as new ways to integrate the
                          science in industries like biotechnology. One such application is in “drug delivery,” which
                          involves “doing chemistry inside living patients to make sure drugs go to the right place and not
                          to the wrong place.” But all those plans for the future came after her surprise, which registered
                          when she first called into the committee. “I’m absolutely stunned. I’m sitting here and can hardly
                          breathe,” she said. “I’m still not entirely positive that it’s real — but it’s getting realer by
                          the minute.” The prize was awarded to Benjamin List and David W.C. MacMillan for their development
                          of a tool that spurred research into new drugs and reduced chemistry’s effect on the environment.

                          Bertozzi also became the eighth woman to be awarded the chemistry prize, the latest since
                          Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer A. Doudna in 2020. Molecules are reacting all around us,
                          constantly, in our drinks, on the tips of our fingers, in our phones. These reactions create new
                          molecules, break down old ones, allow energy swaps — they shape the variegated dynamics of the
                          universe. For scientists looking to understand these forces, combining molecules in a controlled
                          way can be difficult, especially in a delicate environment like a living cell, because everything
                          is so closely connected. Often the surrounding molecules are disturbed in the process, changing the
                          very thing a researcher wants to study. In 2001, Dr. Sharpless and some of his colleagues published
                          a paper introducing something he called click chemistry, a new way of approaching this kind of
                          molecular control when applied to the creation of new drug compounds. The method would be based
                          around one rule, he wrote: “All searches must be restricted to molecules that are easy to make.”
                          Instead of trying to synthesize, or chemically create, molecules by forcing a difficult organic
                          bond, Dr. Sharpless, said, focus instead on bonds that form fast and produce stable byproducts. If
                          done in the right way, the tougher bonds will form automatically, clicking into place. Think of
                          them “as gifts of nature,” Dr. Sharpless wrote.

                          US speed skater Erin Jackson won the women’s 500m gold medal at the Winter Olympics in a time of
                          37.04 on Sunday. Jackson almost missed competing in the 500m at the Olympics after she had slipped
                          during qualifying trials, but her teammate and friend Brittany Bowe gave up her own spot to ensure
                          the world No. 1 was able to go to Beijing – and it paid off. The 29-year-old Jackson is the first
                          US woman to win a speed skating gold at the Olympics since Bonnie Blair did so in 1994, as well as
                          the first Black woman to win an individual medal in speed skating at the Olympics, according to
                          Team USA. She finished 0.08 seconds ahead of Japan’s Miho Takagi in second and 0.17 seconds ahead
                          of the Russian Olympic Committee’s Angelina Golikova in third. “I cried immediately, it was just a
                          big release of emotion. A lot of shock, a lot of relief and a lot of happiness. I haven’t fully
                          processed everything quite yet, but it just feels amazing,” Jackson told reporters. She added: “I
                          had a little misstep on the backstretch, but I just tried to, I wouldn’t say recover, because it
                          wasn’t anything big, but just tried to continue skating.” US speed skater Maame Biney preparing for

Question 25              : When was Lost Ark game release on Steam?

  - Source              :
                          Lost Ark was fully released in South Korea on December 4, 2019, and in North American, South
                          American, and European regions on February 11, 2022, with Amazon Games serving as the global
                          publisher.[16] Users that pre-purchased one of four founder's packs could play 3 days early on
                          February 8, 2022.[17][18][19][20] The game was initially unavailable in Belgium and the Netherlands
                          due to the countries' stringent loot box regulations,[21] with the latter later reversing its
                          decision.[22] Within twenty-four hours of its release, Lost Ark became the second most played game
                          on Steam.[23][24] In 2021, there were plans between Smilegate and game publisher HappyTuk [zh] to
                          launch Lost Ark in Taiwan.[25] It was announced in 2023 that the release of Taiwanese servers has
                          been delayed but not canceled.[26] Lost Ark received "generally favorable" reviews according to
                          review aggregator Metacritic.[27] PC Magazine praised Lost Ark's combat, writing, "Abilities look
                          good, sound sufficiently powerful, and feel great to use. You can’t help but feel like a combat god
                          when you divekick a crowd, and blast fodder monsters into bloody chunks.

                          What about other platforms? Well, developer Smilegate and Lost Ark‘s Western publisher Amazon Games
                          haven’t shared any plans to port the game to Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, or the Epic Games
                          store, but given that the title does offer partial controller support via Steam, it’s not
                          unreasonable to think that it could one day be made available to an even wider audience. In short,
                          anyone hoping to jump into Lost Ark when it goes free-to-play on Friday should probably plan to
                          start playing the game as soon as possible. Otherwise, there’s a pretty good chance that you’ll
                          need to wait a little longer to actually jump in. Ad Ad – content continues below Comment: Written

                          What if you don’t want to purchase a Lost Ark Founder’s Pack and just want to dive into the game
                          once it leaves Early Access and becomes a publically available free-to-play title? Well, the good
                          news is that you’ll soon have a chance to do just that. Ad Ad – content continues below Lost Ark is
                          set to be publically released via Steam as a free-to-play title on February 11th. You can pre-load
                          the game via that platform starting right now (its download size checks in at about 70 GB), but
                          unless you’re willing to buy a Founder’s Pack between now and then, you will need to wait for the
                          title to be fully unlocked before you’ll be able to launch it. As for the release time…well, that’s
                          a little tricky. Ideally, the free-to-play version of Lost Ark will launch via Steam on February 11
                          at the following times: 9 AM PST 12 PM EST5 PM GMT6 PM CETThe reason I say “ideally” in regards to
                          Lost Ark‘s free-to-play launch time is that we already saw players struggle to join Lost Ark in
                          time for its exact Early Access debut. Between congested servers and a few technical issues, many
                          fans found themselves waiting at least a little longer to actually start playing the MMO. Given
                          that the game is being opened up to a significantly larger player base on Friday, it’s likely that
                          you’ll have to navigate similar server issues at that time.

                          October 30, 2020 • 3 For the last decade, Marvel has led the adaptations of superhero comic books
                          into films. In 2019, the journey culminated in the release of Avengers: Endgame, which premiered to
                          critical and commercial success. It had gone from a story about a playboy billionaire (Tony
                          Stark/Iron Man) to a larger story than spanned universes as well as heroes and villains alike.
                          Although, as the universe expanded, it was hard to ignore that Marvel’s roster of superheroes still
                          lacked diversity. This was made even more apparent when other superhero stories started to make
                          their way into the mainstream. In the same year that Endgame came out, a quiet and subversive TV
                          show was making waves. The Boys is adapted from a graphic novel of the same name, one that is
                          notorious amongst fans and haters alike for its crude, graphic and violent nature. The series
                          considers what would happen if superheroes existed in the real world. The short answer is that they
                          would become an untouchable commodity that could wreak havoc, which would be cleaned up by their
                          slick and all-powerful parent company Vought. The series touches on power, social media, politics
                          and causes the line between hero and villain to become truly blurred. It is difficult not to draw
                          comparisons between the storylines in The Boys and the reality of the MCU (Marvel Cinematic
                          Universe).

                          relatives were killed in the Holocaust. Russian troops quickly reach Kyiv’s outskirts, but their
                          attempts to capture the capital and other cities in the northeast meet stiff resistance. Ukrainian
                          President Volodymyr Zelenskyy records a video outside his headquarters to show he is staying and
                          remains in charge.

                          In the fourth round she was defeated by reigning Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina in straight
                          sets.[69] In February 2023, Świątek successfully defended her title at the WTA 500 Qatar Open. She
                          defeated Jessica Pegula in the final in straight sets. This was her first title of the year and the
                          twelfth of her career. She did not drop a set throughout the tournament and only lost five
                          games.[70] At the Dubai Tennis Championships, she defeated Leylah Fernandez, 14th seed Liudmila
                          Samsonova, Karolina Pliskova (by walkover) and fifth seed Coco Gauff, all matches in straight sets
                          with only nine games lost, to reach the final.[71] She lost to Barbora Krejčíková in straight sets,
                          ending her six match winning streak.[72] On 13 March she reached her 50th consecutive week at world
                          No. 1.[73][74] At the Indian Wells Open she defeated Bianca Andreescu and Emma Raducanu in rounds
                          three and four, both in straight sets.[75][76][77] However, she lost once again to Elena Rybakina
                          in the semifinals, preventing Świątek from defending her Indian Wells title. [78] Due to a rib
                          injury suffered during the Indian Wells event, Świątek withdrew from the 2023 Miami Open, which
                          also prevented her from defending her Miami Open title.

                          The second set was entirely different from the first. While Jabeur again didn't win a game until
                          Swiatek was up 3-0, she finally found her gear. Her excellent slice finally began to appear and she
                          began going to the net more, helping her win four of the next five games. Swiatek appeared to have
                          finally wrestled the momentum of the match back to her side, breaking a 5-5 tie to get within one
                          game of the title, but she couldn't close and Jabeur tied it up once again. The tiebreak was close,
                          and it looked like Jabeur could run away with it at any moment, but an unforced error from Jabeur
                          ended the tiebreak and gave Swiatek her first US Open championship and her third career Grand Slam
                          trophy. When it was all over, Swiatek and Jabeur shared a heartfelt embrace, and then Swiatek
                          immediately burst into happy tears. She'd earned it. This victory puts an exclamation point on the
                          best year of Swiatek's young career — or the best year of anyone’s career, really. She started 2022
                          by falling just short of the finals at the Australian Open (she was knocked out in the semis by
                          Danielle Collins), but she rebounded to produce one of the most dominant stretches of tennis we’ve
                          seen in decades. Swiatek beat Annet Kontaveit to win the Qatar Open.

Question 32              : Who won the Male Vocalist of the Year at the 2022 CMA ?

                          Chris Stapleton won the trophy for Male Vocalist of the Year at the 2022 CMA Awards, beating out
                          fellow nominees Eric Church, Luke Combs, Cody Johnson and Morgan Wallen. Visibly moved by the win,
                          Stapleton used the opportunity to share his appreciation with those who have supported his career
                          through the years. "This is a dream every minute we get to live this," he told the crowd during his
                          acceptance speech. "I'm evidence that dreams come true all the time, so thank you, thank you to
                          everybody." Stapleton's Wednesday night win marks the second consecutive year that he has won the
                          Male Vocalist of the Year trophy, and his sixth win in the category overall. From 2015 to 2018, the

                          Chris Stapleton won the trophy for Male Vocalist of the Year at the 2022 CMA Awards, beating out
                          fellow nominees Eric Church, Luke Combs, Cody Johnson and Morgan Wallen. Visibly moved by the win,
                          Stapleton used the opportunity to share his appreciation with those who have supported his career
                          through the years. "This is a dream every minute we get to live this," he told the crowd during his
                          acceptance speech. "I'm evidence that dreams come true all the time, so thank you, thank you to
                          everybody." Stapleton's Wednesday night win marks the second consecutive year that he has won the

                          By Jonas Pope IV The suspense surrounding the rare UNC-N.C. State ACC baseball title game matchup
                          ended when Vance Honeycutt’s first home run landed on West 4th Street. When his second home run
                          landed in almost the same spot, it was celebration time for the Tar Heels, sadness for the
                          Wolfpack. North Carolina defeated N.C. State, 9-5, to win the 2022 ACC tournament title Sunday, the
                          eighth title in school history and first for the Tar Heels since 2019. Carolina won three straight
                          ACC tournament titles from 1982-84 and won it again in 1990 before adding championships in 2007 and
                          2019. Scott Forbes, the Tar Heels’ second-year skipper, won a championship in his first attempt.
                          The title still eludes N.C. State head coach Elliott Avent, in his 26th season. “ACC champs,”
                          Forbes said, tossing his hands in the air. “Our whole approach was we wanted to win an ACC
                          championship for the University of North Carolina, we just happened to be playing N.C. State.” N.C.
                          State hasn’t won an ACC title since 1992. They are 0-8 in title games since then. Sunday’s showdown
                          was the first time since 1990 that the Tar Heels and Wolfpack played in a title game. Carolina won
                          that contest, 5-0.

Question 34              : What chip does the iPhone 14 have?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - Source              :
                          Earlier this week, Qualcomm announced its latest Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 mobile chip and platform,
                          promising to "revolutionize flagship smartphones" with "groundbreaking" experiences. The new chip
                          is expected to launch in flagship Android smartphones later this year, but benchmarks suggest it
                          cannot compete with Apple's A16 Bionic chip, which powers iPhone 14 Pro models. While the latest
                          chip won't officially ship in smartphones for a few months, Geekbench scores for the chip have
                          already been spotted in an unreleased Android handset. According to the results (via DealNTech),
                          the latest Snapdragon 8 chip scored 1483 in single-core and 4709 in multi-core. The A16 Bionic
                          scored 1874 in single-core and 5372 in multi-core. For comparison, the A15 Bionic chip, found in
                          the iPhone 13 Pro and the lower-end iPhone 14 models, also scored higher than Qualcomm's latest
                          chip with 1709 in single-core compared to 1483. In a press release for the new chip, Qualcomm said
                          it will "define a new standard for connected computing, intelligently engineered with
                          groundbreaking AI across the board to enable extraordinary experiences." Qualcomm's senior vice
                          president and general manager of mobile handsets, Chris Patrick, said, "Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 will
                          revolutionize the landscape of flagship smartphones in 2023.

                          The iPhone 14 and 14 Plus feature the same camera system with two cameras: one front-facing camera
                          (12MP f/1.9), and two back-facing cameras: a wide (12MP f/1.5) and ultra-wide (12MP f/2.4) camera,
                          with the wide and front-facing cameras having a faster aperture than the iPhone 13. The
                          front-facing camera also has autofocus for the first time.[30] The cameras use Apple's latest
                          computational photography engine, called Smart HDR 4. Users can also choose from a range of
                          photographic styles during capture, including rich contrast, vibrant, warm, and cool. Apple
                          clarifies this is different from a filter because it works intelligently with the image processing
                          algorithm during capture to apply local adjustments to an image, and the effects will be baked into
                          the photos, unlike filters which can be removed after applying.[6] The camera app contains
                          Cinematic Mode, which allows users to rack focus between subjects and create (simulate) shallow
                          depth of field using software algorithms. It is supported on wide and front-facing cameras in 4K at
                          30 fps.[6] The iPhone 14 is equipped with slightly longer battery life compared to the iPhone 13.
                          According to Apple, the iPhone 14 (3,279 mAh) can provide up to 20 hours of video playback,[31] 16
                          hours of streaming video playback, and 80 hours of audio playback.

                          will kick off with Sundar Pichai’s “Google I/O keynote” at 10 AM. This will be the main attraction
                          for the general population as the main event tends to be more consumer-focused. While the event’s
                          description doesn’t provide specifics, expect to see announcements for popular Google services,
                          Workspace, privacy, health, and Google’s other new projects and endeavors. Also, keep an eye out
                          for potential hardware announcements in the form of the Pixel 6a, Pixel Watch, and smart home
                          devices. The main keynote will be followed by the Developer keynote and “What’s new in Android.”
                          This is where we expect to learn more about Android 13, Wear OS, and updates to developer products
                          and tools. Google says the schedule is slightly different this year.

                          for the general population as the main event tends to be more consumer-focused. While the event’s
                          description doesn’t provide specifics, expect to see announcements for popular Google services,
                          Workspace, privacy, health, and Google’s other new projects and endeavors. Also, keep an eye out
                          for potential hardware announcements in the form of the Pixel 6a, Pixel Watch, and smart home
                          devices. The main keynote will be followed by the Developer keynote and “What’s new in Android.”
                          This is where we expect to learn more about Android 13, Wear OS, and updates to developer products
                          and tools. Google says the schedule is slightly different this year.

Question 36              : who will direct Irredeemable film?
Correct Answers         :  
                          Jeymes Samuel
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - Source              :
                          JAY-Zand director Jeymes Samuel are teaming up again. Six months after the release of their Netflix
                          show-stopper The Harder They Fall, on Thursday, it was announced that the two are collaborating on
                          a film adaption of graphic comics Irredeemable and its spinoff Incorruptible. Directed by Samuel
                          with co-production from Hov and James Lassiter, Kemp Powers, whose credits include 2021 Disney+
                          film Soul and Marvel Studios upcoming Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, will write the script.
                          Boom! Studios’ Stephen Christy and Ross Richie will also assist as co-producers. The Irredeemable
                          graphic series dramatizes how The Plutonian, the world's greatest hero, snapped and became a
                          supervillain. In the comic's sister series Incorruptible, supervillain Max Damage responds to
                          Plutonian's evil by transforming into a superhero. In a statement, Netflix briefly explained the
                          synopsis of the upcoming film. "Protagonists from each series – one a villain on a quest to become
                          a superhero, and the other a fallen hero turned villain – face off." Originating from comic book
                          publisher Boom! Studios, the series was created by author Mark Waid with illustration from Peter
                          Krause. Krause spoke with Deadline about the upcoming Netflix adaptation.

                          Adam McKay has been attached to direct “Irredeemable” for 20th Century Fox, TheWrap has learned.
                          The film is based on the Boom! Comics book of the same name and would help kick off Fox’s brand-new
                          superhero cinematic universe. The “Anchorman” and “Big Short” director will be working with Tommy
                          Wirkola (“Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters”), who is writing the screenplay. In the comics,
                          “Irredeemable” follows superhero-turned-villain, the Plutonian, as he goes on a killing rampage.
                          It’s up to the superhero group The Paradigm to stop him.

                          Brendan Fraser won’t ever be released The previously announced Batgirl film starring In the Heights
                          actor Leslie Grace, Michael Keaton and Brendan Fraser will not be released at all, Warner Bros
                          Discovery has unexpectedly announced, despite shooting already being completed and the film being
                          in post-production. Directed by Ms Marvel directors Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah, the film was
                          initially greenlit in 2021 as part of a wider move at Warner Bros to create feature films
                          specifically for the streaming service HBO Max. But the studio confirmed on Tuesday that the film
                          would never get any release, either theatrically or on HBO Max. It declined to provide further
                          comment. Batgirl was to have Keaton reprise his role as Batman, alongside Grace as the titular hero
                          Barbara Gordon, JK Simmons as Barbara’s father, Commissioner Gordon, and Fraser as the villain
                          Firefly. The Hollywood Reporter said Batgirl’s budget was a factor in the decision, having risen to
                          nearly $90m (£74.1m, A$130m) due to costs relating to it being shot during the Covid-19 pandemic.
                          While the budget is lower than the average DC superhero film, it was reportedly decided that it did
                          not have the “spectacle that audiences have come to expect from DC fare” and would not recoup its
                          losses from being released.

                          without thinking they’re going to die.” In “The Lost City” (in theaters March 25), Bullock plays
                          romance novelist Loretta Sage, whose life is on autopilot until she’s kidnapped by a rich eccentric
                          (Radcliffe) who believes she can lead him to a hidden treasure buried deep in the jungle.

Question 42              : When did Apple M2 chip?

                          When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it
                          works. The M2 chip is here, ushering in the second generation of Apple's bespoke silicon The Apple
                          M2 chip was unveiled at Apple's WWDC 2022 keynote on June 6, and it's the inaugural chip in Apple's
                          second generation of bespoke silicon. This is significant because the M2 is an evolution of the
                          remarkable M1 chip that debuted in 2020, and it powers Apple's new 13-inch MacBook Air 2022 and
                          MacBook Pro 2022. These are successors to two of the best MacBooks on the market, so it's exciting
                          to see what an M2 injection can do. The new Apple M2 chip debuted in two new laptops: the 13-inch
                          MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, which launched in the Summer of 2022. The M2 chip is available in
                          either the 13-inch MacBook Air 2022 (starting price: $1,199) or the MacBook Pro 2022 ($1,299), so
                          you'll need to pay over $1k to get yourself an M2-powered MacBook. It's also available in the Mac
                          mini M2, a cheaper and more powerful version of Apple's pint-sized Mac. Apple's new M2 chip is
                          configurable with an 8-core CPU and up to a 10-core GPU.

                          Apple in June 2022 unveiled the M2, its next-generation Apple silicon chip that followed the M1
                          chip. This guide highlights everything you need to know about the M2 chip, from performance
                          improvements to extra features. The M2 is Apple's next-generation System on a Chip (SoC) developed
                          for use in Macs and iPads. It marks Apple's continued work to transition away from the Intel chips
                          that were used in Macs up until 2020. As a "System on a Chip," the M2 integrates several different
                          components, including the CPU, GPU, unified memory architecture (RAM), Neural Engine, Secure
                          Enclave, SSD controller, image signal processor, encode/decode engines, Thunderbolt controller with
                          USB 4 support, and more, all of which power the different features in the Mac. Before Apple
                          silicon, Macs used multiple chips for CPU, I/O, and security, but Apple's effort to integrate these
                          chips is the reason why the M2 is much faster and more efficient than Intel chips. The unified
                          memory architecture that Apple has included is also a major factor because all of the technologies
                          in the M2 are able to access the same data without having to swap between multiple pools of memory.
                          Built into the M2 chip, the unified memory architecture means the CPU, GPU, and other processor
                          components don't need to copy data between one another, and are able to access the same data pool.

                          Apple in June 2022 unveiled the M2, its next-generation Apple silicon chip that followed the M1
                          chip. This guide highlights everything you need to know about the M2 chip, from performance
                          improvements to extra features. The M2 is Apple's next-generation System on a Chip (SoC) developed
                          for use in Macs and iPads. It marks Apple's continued work to transition away from the Intel chips
                          that were used in Macs up until 2020. As a "System on a Chip," the M2 integrates several different
                          components, including the CPU, GPU, unified memory architecture (RAM), Neural Engine, Secure
                          Enclave, SSD controller, image signal processor, encode/decode engines, Thunderbolt controller with
                          USB 4 support, and more, all of which power the different features in the Mac. Before Apple
                          silicon, Macs used multiple chips for CPU, I/O, and security, but Apple's effort to integrate these
                          chips is the reason why the M2 is much faster and more efficient than Intel chips. The unified
                          memory architecture that Apple has included is also a major factor because all of the technologies
                          in the M2 are able to access the same data without having to swap between multiple pools of memory.
                          Built into the M2 chip, the unified memory architecture means the CPU, GPU, and other processor
                          components don't need to copy data between one another, and are able to access the same data pool.

                          lovers are already expecting the 2023 Academy Awards to be a star-studded affair. The Academy of
                          Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced in May 2022 that the 95th annual Oscars would be held
                          the following March, returning to Hollywood’s iconic Dolby Theatre. Six months later, Jimmy Kimmel
                          was confirmed as the 2023 host. “Being invited to host the Oscars for a third time is either a
                          great honor or a trap. Either way, I am grateful to the Academy for asking me so quickly after
                          everyone good said no,” the comedian teased in a November 2022 statement. Academy CEO Bill Kramer
                          and president Janet Yang called Kimmel “the perfect host,” while ABC exec Craig Erwich praised the
                          Brooklyn native’s poise under pressure. “Having Jimmy Kimmel return to host the Oscars is a dream
                          come true. As we see every night on his own show, Jimmy can handle anything with both heart and
                          humor, and we know that he will deliver the laughs and celebratory moments that define the Oscars,”
                          Erwich continued.

                          So far, little is known about the format of the ceremony or the order of play on the night.
                          However, thanks to a report in Variety on November 29, we do at least know that, unlike in 2022,
                          all 23 categories will be included in the 2023 live telecast. (Last time around, eight
                          categories—editing, production design, make-up and hairstyling, original score, sound, live action
                          short, documentary short, and animated short—were presented off the air, with highlights then
                          edited into the show, prompting outrage from across the industry.) The news was confirmed to the
                          publication by Bill Kramer, the CEO of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, who added:
                          “We are committed to having a show that celebrates the artisans, the arts and sciences and the
                          collaborative nature of moviemaking. This is very much what the mission of the Academy is, and I am
                          very hopeful that we can do a show that celebrates all components of moviemaking in an entertaining
                          and engaging way.” As for the rest of the show? “All I will say right now is that our anniversary,
                          the 95th Oscars, is extremely important to us,” he said. “I think it sets a really interesting
                          rhythm for our 100th. You see this in the museum. I think we are able to celebrate our legacy while
                          bringing the Academy into the future and the show will reflect that.

                          reported first-quarter vehicle production and delivery numbers for 2022. Here's how they did.
                          Electric vehicle deliveries (total): 310,048 Electric vehicle production (total): 305,407 Over the
                          same period last year, Tesla delivered 184,800 electric vehicles and produced 180,338 cars. Model 3
                          and Model Y vehicles comprised 95%, or 295,324, of deliveries in the first quarter of 2022,
                          according to Tesla. The company produced 4,641 fewer cars than it delivered during the quarter
                          citing "ongoing supply chain challenges and factory shutdowns." Analysts expected deliveries of
                          317,000 vehicles for the first three months of 2022, according to estimates compiled by FactSet as

                          quarter-on-quarter sales growth was modest despite price cuts as rising competition and a bleak
                          economic outlook weighed. Tesla delivered 422,875 vehicles for the first three months of this year,
                          up 4% from the previous quarter. This was 36% higher than a year ago. In January, Chief Executive
                          Elon Musk said Tesla could achieve 2 million vehicle deliveries this year, up 52% from last year.
                          Investors have been watching Musk's gamble that cutting prices would stimulate sales, although they
                          worry about eroding margins. In January, Tesla slashed prices globally by as much as 20%,
                          unleashing a price war after missing Wall Street delivery estimates for 2022. The basic Model Y
                          that used to sell for $65,990 now costs $54,990. "If they wouldn't have done the price cut, it
                          would have been ugly. I think what it tells you is the economy is getting tough," Gene Munster,
                          managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, said on Sunday. "They showed an acceleration, but
                          they didn't accelerate to the level that Elon had suggested it would." Musk, who has missed his own
                          ambitious sales targets for Tesla in recent years, said in January that 2023 deliveries could hit 2
                          million vehicles, absent external disruption, from 1.3 million in 2022.

                          At least one of the executives who was fired was escorted out of Twitter’s office, they said. Mr.
                          Musk, who is one of Twitter’s most active users and has more than 109 million followers, began
                          accumulating shares in the company this year. In April, he struck the deal to buy the company for
                          $44 billion and said he would lift Twitter’s content moderation policies, eliminate spam, add new
                          features and provide more transparency about the algorithms used to promote content. “Twitter has
                          tremendous potential — I look forward to working with the company and the community of users to
                          unlock it,” he said in a statement in April. But, within weeks, he began questioning the deal. Mr.
                          Musk lashed out at the Twitter executives responsible for content decisions and accused the company
                          of failing to accurately count the spam accounts on its platform. When Parag Agrawal, Twitter’s
                          chief executive, tried debunking Mr. Musk’s claims, Mr. Musk responded by tweeting a poop emoji. By
                          July, Mr. Musk had decided that he no longer wanted to own Twitter, arguing that he had been misled
                          about the amount of spam on the platform. He announced his intent to abandon the acquisition.
                          Twitter sued Mr. Musk to force him to carry out the agreement. The company accused Mr. Musk of
                          trying to back out of the deal because the economic downturn had caused a decline in his personal
                          wealth. Mr. Musk had agreed to personally provide roughly $33 billion of the $44 billion deal.

                          $44 billion and said he would lift Twitter’s content moderation policies, eliminate spam, add new
                          features and provide more transparency about the algorithms used to promote content. “Twitter has
                          tremendous potential — I look forward to working with the company and the community of users to
                          unlock it,” he said in a statement in April. But, within weeks, he began questioning the deal. Mr.
                          Musk lashed out at the Twitter executives responsible for content decisions and accused the company
                          of failing to accurately count the spam accounts on its platform. When Parag Agrawal, Twitter’s
                          chief executive, tried debunking Mr. Musk’s claims, Mr. Musk responded by tweeting a poop emoji. By
                          July, Mr. Musk had decided that he no longer wanted to own Twitter, arguing that he had been misled
                          about the amount of spam on the platform. He announced his intent to abandon the acquisition.
                          Twitter sued Mr. Musk to force him to carry out the agreement. The company accused Mr. Musk of
                          trying to back out of the deal because the economic downturn had caused a decline in his personal
                          wealth. Mr. Musk had agreed to personally provide roughly $33 billion of the $44 billion deal.

Question 51              : Who won the 2022 Masters Tournament?
Correct Answers         :

                          Scottie Scheffler won the 2022 Masters on Sunday following a dominant performance at Augusta
                          National. The world No. 1 finished ahead of Northern Irishman Rory McIlroy to claim his first major
                          title. After two close-range misses on the 18th green, he rolled home the winning putt and carded a
                          final round one-under par 71 to finish on 10-under for the tournament, three shots ahead of
                          second-placed McIlroy. Over the four days at the lush, sprawling golf club in Augusta, Georgia,
                          Scheffler produced some excellent golf, refusing to falter under the pressure of being the
                          tournament’s leader for nearly three days. In the end, he was rewarded for his recent run of good
                          form, winning the most prestigious tournament title out there, as well as going home with the
                          famous green jacket and the $2.7 million winners purse. Asked how he felt in the immediate
                          aftermath, Scheffler said he was “pretty tired.” “I want to go home! I’m pretty tired right now –
                          I’m really at a loss for words right now,” he said. “I can’t thank my family enough – they’ve made
                          many sacrifices over the years. To have the honor of winning the tournament and to have my family
                          with me was incredible.” The last two months have been transformative for Scheffler.

                          Over the next several hours, Scheffler, 25, rebuffed every challenge with the same aplomb to claim
                          his first major championship, running away to win the 2022 Masters by three strokes. His margin of
                          victory would have been larger but for a final show of some nerves during the tournament’s closing
                          sequence on the 18th green, when Scheffler needed four putts, including three from less than five
                          feet, to close out a round of 71. Scheffler finished 10 under par for the tournament, in just his
                          third Masters appearance. Rory McIlroy, who trailed Scheffler by 10 strokes heading into the final
                          round, finished second after an eight-under-par 64. Smith and Shane Lowry tied for third, five
                          strokes off the lead. Speaking with reporters after donning the ceremonial green jacket awarded to
                          Masters winners, Scheffler talked of feeling calm on the course during the final round but said he
                          was “so stressed out” on Sunday morning. “I cried like a baby,” he said. “I was so overwhelmed.”
                          Scheffler added that he told his wife, Meredith, “I don’t think I’m ready for this.” Scheffler said
                          he could not recall any previous episodes of self-doubt and attributed it to an understanding of
                          how much winning the Masters would mean to him. “I’ve felt at peace on the golf course,” he said,
                          laughing.

                          tennis title at the 2022 Australian Open. She became the first home player to win an Australian
                          Open singles title since Chris O'Neil in 1978. It was Barty's third major singles title, and she
                          won the title without losing a set, dropping just three service games during the tournament.[1] The
                          final also marked Barty's last professional appearance, as she announced her retirement from the
                          sport two months later.[2] Naomi Osaka was the defending champion,[3] but lost to Amanda Anisimova
                          in the third round.[4] Barty retained the world No. 1 singles ranking after Aryna Sabalenka and
                          Barbora Krejčíková lost in the fourth round and quarterfinals, respectively. Collins entered the
                          WTA top 10 rankings for the first time by reaching the final.[5] Alizé Cornet reached her first

                          She also knew that all of the effort she put in, to overcome self-doubt and those dreaded
                          double-faults, had to pay off eventually. Just had to. And so, as she wasted a second match point
                          by flubbing a forehand, and a third by again missing another, Sabalenka did her best to stay calm,
                          something she used to find quite difficult. She hung in there until a fourth chance to close out
                          Elena Rybakina presented itself — and this time, Sabalenka saw a forehand from her similarly
                          powerful foe sail long. That was that. The championship belonged to Sabalenka via a 4-6, 6-3, 6-4
                          comeback victory over Wimbledon winner Rybakina. “The last game, yeah, of course, I was a little
                          bit nervous. I (kept) telling myself, like, ’Nobody tells you that it’s going to be easy.’ You just
                          have to work for it, work for it, ’til the last point,” said Sabalenka, a 24-year-old from Belarus
                          who is now 11-0 with two titles in 2023 and will rise to No. 2 in the WTA rankings on Monday. “I’m
                          super happy that I was able to handle all those emotions,” she said, “and win this one.” The only
                          set she has dropped all season was the opener on Saturday against Rybakina, who eliminated No.

                          singles tennis title at the 2022 Australian Open.[1] It was his second Australian Open title and

                          Federer and Novak Djokovic.[2][3] Nadal became the fourth man, after Roy Emerson, Rod Laver, and
                          Djokovic, to achieve the double career Grand Slam, and the second in the Open Era.[4] He also
                          became the first man in the Open Era to win an Australian Open final after losing the first two
                          sets.[5] This marked the third consecutive year a man trailed by two sets in a major final yet

                          at the 2020 US Open.[6] Djokovic was the three-time reigning champion,[7] but did not compete after
                          his visa was cancelled shortly before the tournament began due to an intervention from Australia's
                          Immigration Minister Alex Hawke, citing risks to public health and good order in Australia.[8] That
                          meant Nadal was the only former champion (2009) to compete in the tournament, with both Federer and

                          2006.[3] Barbora Krejčíková was the defending champion,[4] but she lost in the first round to Diane

                          tennis, c’est la vie. It’s the second major of the season, and indeed, tennis is life. Top singles
                          and doubles players from the ATP and WTA are putting it all on the line in Paris hoping to become
                          the King and Queen of the French clay as first-round play begins on May 28. The men’s singles draw
                          may be missing its most recent, and most celebrated champion — Rafael Nadal isn’t competing this
                          year due to injury — but that doesn’t mean there aren’t plenty of tenacious competitors looking to
                          claim the 2023 French Open crown, including reigning US Open champion Carlos Alcaraz, who’s fresh
                          off his 20th birthday, and 22-time Grand Slam singles champion Novak Djokovic. And in women’s
                          singles, 2022 French Open champion Iga Swiatek is back and ready for a repeat, as is last year’s
                          runner-up, Coco Gauff.

                          Had Alcaraz not dealt with cramping in his leg on Friday, it's worth wondering whether he would
                          have given Djokovic a better run for his money. The Spaniard is widely believed to be the next big
                          thing in men's tennis, and he already has one Grand Slam title to his name as a 20-year-old,
                          winning the 2022 U.S. Open by defeating Ruud. Alcaraz won the U.S. Open when he was just 19 years
                          old, becoming the first male player to win a Grand Slam as a teenager since Nadal accomplished the
                          feat at Roland Garros in 2005. Additionally, Alcaraz has won 10 ATP Tour men's singles titles,
                          which includes the 2022 U.S. Open and four Masters 1000 titles. Two of his Masters 1000 titles came
                          in the Madrid Open, while the others came in the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells and the Miami
                          Open. Alcaraz, who turned pro in 2018, is only just getting started, and tennis fans around the
                          globe are in for a treat once he hits his prime. Back in the French Open final for the second
                          straight year, Ruud should not be taken lightly entering Sunday despite having to go up against one
                          of the greatest players of all time.

                          She had a cast on her surgically repaired left wrist, so her visit was limited to sightseeing

  - Source              :
                          Three-time defending champion Novak Djokovic defeated Nick Kyrgios in the final, 4–6, 6–3, 6–4,
                          7–6(7–3) to win the gentlemen's singles tennis title at the 2022 Wimbledon Championships. It was
                          his seventh Wimbledon title and 21st major singles title overall.[1] Djokovic became the fifth man
                          in the Open Era to record a streak of at least four consecutive titles at one major.[2] By reaching
                          his 32nd men's singles major final, he surpassed the all-time record he had jointly held with Roger
                          Federer.[3] Djokovic also became the first player (male or female) to win 80 matches at all four
                          majors with his first-round win over Kwon Soon-woo.[4] Because no ranking points were awarded for
                          the tournament in response to its banning of Russian and Belarusian players, Djokovic dropped out
                          of the top five in ATP rankings after the tournament.[5] Kyrgios became the first unseeded man to
                          reach a major final since Jo-Wilfried Tsonga at the 2008 Australian Open, the first Australian man
                          to reach a major final since Lleyton Hewitt at the 2005 Australian Open, and the first unseeded or
                          Australian man to reach the Wimbledon final since Mark Philippoussis in 2003.[6]

                          sets that Swiatek handed out this season, which is the most since Serena Williams was running her
                          bagel factory in 2013 (notching 25). 37 – In 2022 Swiatek posted a 37-match win streak that left
                          her unbeaten for 135 days, which tied her with Martina Hingis for the longest winning streak since
                          1997. Swiatek’s streak is the joint-longest win streak on tour since 1990.

                          Find out how the trophy was won and all the other results from Saturday 10th September at the
                          fourth and final grand slam of the year. World No1 Iga Swiatek won the women's title at the 2022 US
                          Open tennis grand slam on Saturday (10 September), defeating Ons Jabeur 6-2, 7-6 [7-5]. With her
                          victory at Flushing Meadows in New York, the fourth and final grand slam of the year, Swiatek
                          claimed her third Grand Slam trophy after she won the 2020 and 2022 French Open. The Polish
                          superstar raced to a dominant first-set win on the hard courts of the USTA Billie Jean King
                          National Tennis Center. However, Jabeur made things complicated for the 21-year-old in a marathon
                          second set. The title, which Great Britain's Emma Raducanu won in 2021, was the first time a No1
                          seed won the US Open final since Serena Williams in 2014. The men's final takes place on Sunday as
                          Carlos Alcaraz (ESP) will take on Casper Ruud (NOR). Swiatek became the first woman to win seven
                          titles in one year since Serena Williams in 2014. "You have to be mentally strong throughout the
                          whole tournament," Swiatek told ESPN. "It wasn't easy. I know I didn't play perfectly. Sometimes
                          you have to accept that.

                          64 BLACKSBURG, Va. — Amid the excitement and fanfare of a new head coach comes an uncomfortable
                          side of things too. The previous regime at Virginia Tech wasn’t cutting it, nor were some of the
                          players. It’s how a program once revered for its consistent ability to win 10 games a year finishes
                          under .500 in three of the past four seasons. Advertisement So for new Hokies head coach Brent Pry,
                          chief among his tasks is to be open and honest with players about where they fit in the new world
                          order, what their role is and, in some cases, whether he thinks they’re good enough to play at
                          Virginia Tech. “We can’t be afraid of hard conversations,” Pry said. “Everybody in here has
                          weaknesses, including myself. It’s about staring at those head-on and addressing them and let’s go
                          work through them and strengthen them.” In that spirit, here’s a hard conversation for Hokies fans:
                          This season could be a rough one. That’s not a commentary on Pry’s long-term viability as Tech’s
                          coach. The early returns seem positive, with Pry saying and doing all the right things and sowing
                          the seeds with how he and his staff are re-establishing themselves in the state on the recruiting
                          trail after many of those relationships atrophied in the Justin Fuente era. But this roster isn’t
                          in a quick-fix situation.

  - Source              :
                          In college, I once proposed a hilarious—albeit deranged—sociology study. Imagine if you could take
                          someone who didn’t know anything about American sports and put them in a place where the only
                          access they had to the outside world was ESPN’s First Take back when Stephen A. Smith and Skip
                          Bayless were on it. After a year, you take said person and ask them about sports. Their
                          understanding of sports would be, err, interesting. The Consensus operates somewhat like that, but
                          for Best of cigar lists. Imagine you knew someone who didn’t smoke cigars but saw all of the Top
                          25/Top 10/etc. lists put out by various genres of cigar media. They’d also need an incredible
                          memory and decent addition/subtraction skills. Their understanding of what the best cigars of the
                          year would be based not on their own experience, but rather, on the lists produced by various cigar
                          media. And imagine if they took the lists at basically equal value. That’s The Consensus, though
                          it’s a spreadsheet, not a person. I started this concept more than a decade ago with the goal of
                          trying to see if there was a commonality within cigar media. I never really aimed to figure out
                          what the best cigar of the year was—after all, I could tell you my personal favorite—but I wanted
                          to see what the collective cigar media had to say.

Question 70              : When did the 148th Kentucky Derby take place?
Correct Answers         :

                          The 2022 Kentucky Derby (officially, the 148th Running of the Kentucky Derby Presented by Woodford
                          Reserve[1]) took place on Saturday, May 7, 2022, at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky. It was
                          the 148th running of the Kentucky Derby, a 1+1⁄4 miles (2.0 km) Grade I stakes race for
                          three-year-old Thoroughbreds. The Derby is held annually at Churchill Downs on the first Saturday
                          in May since its inception in 1875. The 20 horses that ran in the Derby qualified by earning points
                          in the 2022 Road to the Kentucky Derby. The two favorites for the 2022 Kentucky Derby were
                          Epicenter, the winner of the Louisiana Derby, and Zandon, the winner of the Blue Grass Stakes. Both
                          horses finished behind winner Rich Strike, who had only entered the race after a late scratch.
                          Entering the race at odds of 80–1, Rich Strike's victory was the second-largest upset in Derby
                          history. It was the first Kentucky Derby victory for his trainer Eric Reed, as well as the first
                          graded stakes win in any race for his jockey Sonny Leon. Participation in the Kentucky Derby is
                          restricted to three-year-old Thoroughbreds.

                          The 148th running of the Kentucky Derby will take place Saturday at Churchill Downs in Louisville,
                          Kentucky. Zandon, leaving from the 10 post, opened as the 3-1 morning-line favorite after Derby
                          post positions were released Monday, followed closely by Epicenter at 7-2 from the third position.
                          Post time for Saturday's one and one-quarter mile race is 6:57 p.m. ET. In last year's edition of
                          the Run for the Roses, Medina Spirit crossed the finish line first, which appeared to have given
                          trainer Bob Baffert a record seventh win in the race and jockey John Velazquez his fourth Derby
                          win. However, the horse tested positive for a banned race-day substance and the Kentucky Horse
                          Racing Commission stripped Medina Spirit of his Derby title in February. With Medina Spirit's win
                          vacated, second-place finisher Mandaloun improved to first place. Here are the morning-line odds
                          for the 2022 Kentucky Derby, in order of post position (with trainer and jockey): Trainer: Todd
                          Pletcher Jockey: Irad Ortiz Jr. Trainer: Doug O'Neill Jockey: Rafael Bejarano Trainer: Steve

                          The initial months of 2021 were not favorable for automakers. Semiconductor shortages derailed the
                          post-COVID recovery, affecting vehicle sales worldwide. But the shortages have eased a bit one year
                          later and auto sales are reviving. Automakers expect to recover the losses made during the last two
                          years, soon. However, traditional automakers are unable to cope with the rising demand for pure
                          EVs, whereas Tesla’s ability to address this demand has rewarded it not only with higher vehicle
                          sales in Q1 2022 but also a record revenue of $18.8 billion. Tesla has also started deliveries to
                          car rental service provider Hertz against its huge 100,000-vehicle order, which is also a reason
                          for high vehicle production and delivery during the quarter. Tesla’s Q1 2022 revenue would have
                          been more without the fresh COVID wave that has hit Shanghai and surrounding areas, affecting the
                          company’s production there. From the second week of March, rising cases of a new COVID variant have
                          forced automakers operating around Shanghai to suspend production. The urge to achieve L4 autonomy
                          by the end of 2023 and to roll out robotaxis by early 2025 can be a major reason for Tesla’s big
                          R&D spend. Besides, Tesla could also be conducting research on developing new battery chemistry.
                          The soaring prices of some key battery components like nickel and lithium have put the auto OEMs in
                          a spot.

                          STX Entertainment is an American entertainment and media company. Founded in March 2014 by film
                          producer Robert Simonds, the studio produces film, television, and digital media projects. In April
                          2020, STX announced that it would merge with the Indian studio Eros International plc. The merger
                          was completed in July 2020, and STX became a division of ErosSTX. In December 2021, Jahm Najafi
                          announced his intention to acquire STX from the merged company for $173 million–a sale completed in
                          April 2022. Eros remains a minority, non-voting shareholder.[1] In 2012, Simonds and McGlashan
                          began work on conceptualizing a media company based on the idea of producing medium-budget projects
                          with a star attached, a method that had gone out of style with Hollywood studios. The conversation
                          led to the launch of STX Entertainment in 2014, with the mission to finance, develop, produce,
                          market, and distribute star-driven content around the world.[2][3] Investors in the company
                          included Hony Capital, Tencent, PCCW, TPG Growth, and Liberty Global. Individual investors include
                          Gigi Pritzker, Beau Wrigley, and Dominic Ng.[4][5][6] In September 2017, it was reported that STX
                          was considering an initial public offering on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (SEHK).

                          Orrin Grant Hatch (March 22, 1934 – April 23, 2022) was an American attorney and politician who
                          served as a United States senator from Utah from 1977 to 2019. Hatch's 42-year Senate tenure made
                          him the longest-serving Republican U.S. senator in history, overtaking Ted Stevens, until Chuck
                          Grassley surpassed him in 2023. Hatch chaired the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and
                          Pensions from 1981 to 1987. He served as chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee from 1995 to 2001
                          and 2003 to 2005. On January 3, 2015, after the 114th United States Congress was sworn in, he
                          became president pro tempore of the Senate. He was chair of the Senate Finance Committee from 2015
                          to 2019, and led efforts to pass the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Orrin Grant Hatch was born in
                          Homestead, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Pittsburgh.[1][2] He was the son of Jesse Hatch (1904–1992), a
                          metal lather,[3] and his wife Helen Frances Hatch (née Kamm; 1906–1995). Hatch had eight brothers

                          This article was published more than 1 year ago Orrin G. Hatch, a conservative Utah Republican who
                          came out of political nowhere to win a U.S. Senate seat in 1976 and ended his career 42 years later
                          as the longest-serving Republican in the chamber’s history and one of his party’s most influential
                          lawmakers of recent decades, died April 23 in Salt Lake City. He was 88. The death was announced by
                          the Hatch Foundation. The cause was not immediately disclosed. Tall and slim in build and
                          impeccable in dress, Mr. Hatch had a gentlemanly demeanor but behind it wielded strong views, high
                          energy and a love for legislative give-and-take that made him a force on Capitol Hill. When he
                          retired in 2019, at the end of his seventh term, he chaired the powerful tax-writing Finance
                          Committee and by virtue of his seniority was Senate president pro tempore. By the end of his
                          tenure, Mr. Hatch had sponsored or co-sponsored 790 pieces of legislation that became law, more
                          than any other senator in office at the time, according to Library of Congress data. He achieved
                          that record in part through his willingness to work with liberal Democrats. “He was a tough
                          partisan, a solid conservative, but he could make strategic alliances to get legislation passed,”
                          former Senate historian Donald Ritchie said in an interview. “No one questioned his ideology, so he
                          could deal.

                          Jump to Warner Bros. Discovery should not hire a new CEO for CNN. Chris Licht's exit from that role
                          gives WBD an opportunity to rethink what kind of leadership the organization really needs, and CEO
                          David Zaslav should grab it. You know who wasn't CEO of CNN? Jeff Zucker, the network's boss for
                          nine years. Zucker's title was president of CNN Worldwide. He was also chairman of WarnerMedia News
                          & Sports, but that's not the role he was known for. And while there are plenty of criticisms to
                          make of his tenure — the firehose coverage of Trump, ratings challenges, the undisclosed consensual
                          relationship with a colleague that precipitated his exit — Zucker was a strong, dynamic general who
                          held the hearts and minds of CNN's newsroom. Without a CEO title. Insider recently published an org
                          chart highlighting the most powerful executives at WBD — it reveals that there are nine people with
                          a CEO title reporting to Zaslav. Nine. A CEO runs a company. WBD is a sprawling global
                          entertainment conglomerate with many complex divisions, but it is not a holding company with nine
                          subsidiaries each requiring its own chief executive. Zaslav is the chief executive of all of those
                          divisions, especially CNN, where he reportedly was very involved with day-to-day operations, even
                          though the network represents less than 10% of WBD revenue, The Wall Street Journal reported.

  - Source              :
                          Discovery head of streaming JB Perrette and now-CNN Chief Operating Officer David Leavy, were
                          skeptical of spending hundreds of millions of dollars on niche or half-baked content ideas like
                          "Jake Tapper's Book Club" and "Parental Guidance with Anderson Cooper." Leavy is now part of the
                          executive team that will help Zaslav find a new CEO. Zaslav thought CNN+ was a waste of resources
                          for a company saddled with $50 billion of debt that needed to boost free cash flow and generate $3
                          billion in merger-related synergies. But before he made any decisions, he wanted to hear Licht's
                          thoughts. Licht was supposed to begin his job May 2, 2022, but he started a few weeks early to
                          weigh in on CNN+. In several virtual conferences, he met with CNN+ head Andrew Morse, CNN+ general
                          manager Alex MacCallum and CNN Chief Tech Officer Robyn Peterson, according to people familiar with
                          the matter who declined to be identified due to the private nature of the talks. Perrette and
                          Discovery streaming CFO Neil Chugani (who would become CNN's CFO) were also there. Licht expressed
                          his skepticism with the product's programming, according to people in the meeting. The discussion
                          centered around the viability of offering a product named after CNN without actually featuring a
                          live feed of the network's cable programming. Perrette told the CNN+ leadership to pause all
                          marketing spending and not to launch on Roku.

                          France must make its voice heard,” Macron said. During her campaign, Le Pen pledged to dilute
                          French ties with the 27-nation EU, NATO and Germany, moves that would have shaken Europe’s security
                          architecture as the continent deals with its worst conflict since World War II. Le Pen also spoke
                          against EU sanctions on Russian energy supplies and faced scrutiny during the campaign over her
                          previous friendliness with the Kremlin. A chorus of European leaders hailed Macron’s victory, since
                          France has played a leading role in international efforts to punish Russia with sanctions and is
                          supplying weapons to Ukraine. “Democracy wins, Europe wins,” said Spanish Prime Minister Pedro
                          Sánchez. “Together we will make France and Europe advance,” tweeted European Commission President
                          Ursula von der Leyen. Italian Premier Mario Draghi called Macron’s victory “splendid news for all
                          of Europe” and a boost to the EU “being a protagonist in the greatest challenges of our times,
                          starting with the war in Ukraine.” Macron won with 58.5% of the vote to Le Pen’s 41.5% —
                          significantly closer than when they first faced off in 2017. Macron is the first French president

Question 77              : What is the megapixel in main camera on the iPhone 14 Pro?

                          The iPhone 14 Pro's lens on the main rear camera also has a wider field of view than the 13 Pro's:
                          24mm versus 26mm. This means you can get a little more in your shot, which might be especially
                          helpful for landscape photography. The iPhone 14 Pro also has another trick up its sleeve: The
                          48-megapixel sensor can also take 12-megapixel shots at an effective 2x optical zoom. You'll see a
                          new 2x option in the camera interface. That crops the center of the higher-resolution image to
                          immediately give you more flexibility with focal length, without needing a fourth lens. The iPhone
                          13 Pro can also take photos at 2x zoom, but it uses digital zoom and doesn't have the same quality
                          or level of detail as this new technique. I find the new 2x option on the iPhone 14 Pro helps with
                          portrait mode. Instead of just offering 1x and 3x options like on the older phone, it can also snap
                          portrait mode photos at 2x. This results in more natural-looking shots to my eye. I find it's more
                          flattering on facial features than the wide look from 1x, or the zoomed-in perspective at 3x. The

                          Taiyab said he applauded Apple for trying to empower iPhone owners but had a harsh verdict. “They
                          set up the customer to fail,” he said. The self-repair program, I concluded, is impractical for
                          most people. For starters, the cost of renting the equipment and purchasing parts from Apple — $96
                          to replace my iPhone 12’s battery — was more than the $69 an Apple store charges to do the job. And
                          as my experience shows, the process was challenging even with Apple’s tools. Apple discourages most
                          people from trying self-repair. “For the vast majority of customers, the safest and most reliable
                          repair is achieved through an Apple Store” and thousands of authorized repair centers, the company
                          said in a white paper last month. “Repairing modern electronic devices that are complex, highly
                          integrated and miniaturized isn’t easy.” This raises the question of why Apple rolled out the
                          self-repair program in the first place. It is probably no coincidence that it made the move after
                          the Federal Trade Commission said last year that it would ramp up enforcement against tech
                          companies that made it hard for people to fix their electronics. And now, my tale of defeat. I
                          started by visiting Apple’s self-repair program website, selfservicerepair.com. There I found the
                          service manual for the iPhone 12 I wanted to repair and ordered the tools. (Apple’s program
                          currently includes manuals for iPhones released in the last two years.

                          I’m just betting on Durant until I see anything to suggest I shouldn’t. Lambre: Gimme Lakers and
                          Nets. The Lakers have the easiest road to reaching the Finals because of bad injury luck to teams
                          like the Clippers and Nuggets. The Nets will, by season’s end, be the most talented team in the
                          East and will therefore vanquish all challengers come playoff time. Mahoney: Brooklyn outlasts an
                          improved, more streamlined Milwaukee team to make it out of the East, in part because Irving took
                          leave from his post as a voice for the voiceless, got his shots, and joined the team midseason. The
                          absolute chaos of the West winds up working in the favor of the steadiest team in the conference:
                          the Phoenix Suns, who play with a similar polish but more pop owed to the further development of
                          their young core. Murdock: Lakers-Nets. Assuming everyone’s healthy, these are the two best teams
                          in the league. And, more importantly, it’s what everyone wants. Make it happen, NBA. Verrier: Nets
                          and Lakers. The 2021 Finals was the first without either KD or LeBron in a decade. I wouldn’t bet
                          on that happening again this year. Check your inbox for a welcome email. Oops. Something went

                          When news of the reality competition spin-off was announced last week, some on social media pointed
                          out the irony of such a competition show. “The game is intended to represent the commodification of
                          suffering by privileged people, and how watching people struggle for money and their lives is seen
                          as entertainment for people who will never have to experience such things,” said Mika Winder, 16,
                          of Oregon. “Making a real life version goes against the entire message of the original show in an
                          almost comical way." Others echoed similar sentiments on social media, including one person who
                          tweeted: “Did Netflix even watch the show? Did they glean any meaning from it?” Netflix and

                          were not revealed in Netflix's press release or the show's casting application. For some fans of
                          "Squid Game," like Dracy Peters, the reality competition series is an opportunity to "have fun."
                          Peters, 23, of Louisiana, said he's applying to be a contestant to put his knowledge of the games
                          to the test. “The show is a work of fiction with an elaborate plot, where the characters had to
                          risk their lives for the money,” Peters said.

                          Netflix is recruiting participants for a reality TV show inspired by its most popular series of all
                          time, Squid Game. However, it will not be life or death that is at stake, as depicted in the South
                          Korean dystopian drama. Instead, 456 recruits from around the world will play games where "the
                          worst fate is going home empty-handed" - missing out on a $4.56m (£3.8m) prize. Netflix also
                          confirmed that the popular series would be renewed for a second season earlier this week. On
                          Wednesday, the platform announced that its new 10-episode series - Squid Game: The Challenge -
                          would offer the "largest cast and lump cash prize in reality TV history". "As [players] compete
                          through a series of games inspired by the original show - plus surprising new additions - their
                          strategies, alliances, and character will be put to the test while competitors are eliminated
                          around them," it added. Participants need to be at least 21 years old. They must speak English, and
                          be available for up to 4 weeks in early 2023 for filming. The 456 participants are a nod to the
                          fictional series, which features the same number of players, with its main protagonist Seong Gi-hun
                          also referred to as Player 456. The South Korean thriller series tells the story of debt-ridden
                          people competing for a huge cash prize in a deadly series of children's games.

Question 83              : When was Overwatch 2 released?

                          These missions are only available as free-to-play game modes during specific seasons, but Blizzard
                          will offer to buy permanent access to these missions separately or as part of a battle pass
                          bundle.[11] Overwatch 2 was announced at BlizzCon on November 1, 2019, with plans that the game
                          would maintain a "shared multiplayer environment" between it and the original Overwatch, so that
                          players in either game could compete in the existing player versus player (PvP) game modes,
                          retaining all unlocked cosmetics and other features.[12] Jeff Kaplan, director for Overwatch,
                          explained that this was a major decision and that he had to justify this "player-first standpoint"
                          to Blizzard executives, given the current industry trend to draw in new sales.[13] All new heroes,
                          maps, and PvP modes were to be added to both games to maintain this shared environment.[14]
                          However, Overwatch 2 was later announced as a free-to-play title, and that on its release on
                          October 4, 2022, Blizzard affirmed that Overwatch 2 live services would replace those of the
                          original game; the original Overwatch servers would be shut down on October 2, 2022.[15] Players
                          retained their existing cosmetics and in-game currency, with remaining loot boxes opened
                          automatically upon the release of Overwatch 2.

Question 87              : What was the revenue of AWS in Q2 2022?

  - Source              :
                          Amazon said its cloud-computing division Amazon Web Services (AWS) posted 33 percent increase in
                          its revenue to $19.7 billion in the second quarter of 2022. AWS has generated operating income of
                          $5.71 billion in Q2. Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky said on an analyst call that a downturn in 2008
                          resulted in companies choosing to use Amazon’s cloud services rather than build their own data
                          centers, giving AWS a boost. Rival Microsoft said earlier this week that its fiscal-year revenue
                          would jump on demand for its cloud services. Log in to leave a comment Hey there! Be sure to

  - Source              :
                          The News: Amazonâ€™s Q2 2022 revenue increased to $121.2 billion in the quarter ending June 30, up
                          seven percent from $113 billion brought in by the broadly diversified ecommerce, cloud, advertising
                          and services company one year ago. In its earnings report on July 28, Amazon showed mixed results
                          but positive trajectories for many of its business units, which helped Amazon shares rise by 13
                          percent in extended trading on July 29. Read the Press Release about the Q2 2022 earnings on
                          Amazonâ€™s investor website. Analyst Take: Amazonâ€™s Q2 2022 results came in better than analysts
                          expected, which is a bright spot, especially considering the powerful macroeconomic headwinds and
                          unsteady world conditions that continue to affect Amazonâ€™s broad range of business units and
                          other companies in general. But Amazonâ€™s guidance for the rest of 2022 is even better, showing
                          that the company is above the fold for demand in a tougher macro environment.

                          The Xenoblade Chronicles 3 release date was on July 29, meaning the game is out now. That’s right,
                          go check it out! The story itself is new, and it “ties together the futures of the worlds depicted
                          in Xenoblade Chronicles and Xenoblade Chronicles 2.” There are two warring factions in the world of
                          Aionios – Keves and Agnus. The former is responsible for mechanical technology, while the latter
                          prefers magical tech. You can learn more in our Xenoblade Chronicles 3 colonies guide. When in
                          combat, you can battle with up to seven characters, and, much like in previous Xenoblade games, you
                          must directly face an enemy out in the field to engage in a fight. Naturally, each character brings
                          their own strengths to the battlefield, and this allows you to use a range of strategies. There is
                          also a new mechanic called interlinking, which you can learn more about in our Xenoblade Chronicles
                          3 Ouroboros guide. Furthermore, each character falls under a different class, and this only adds to

                          Xenoblade Chronicles 3[b] is a 2022 action role-playing game developed by Monolith Soft and
                          published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch. It is an installment in the open-world Xenoblade
                          Chronicles series, itself a part of the larger Xeno franchise. Xenoblade Chronicles 3 depicts the
                          futures of the worlds featured in Xenoblade Chronicles (2010) and Xenoblade Chronicles 2 (2017) and
                          concludes the trilogy's narrative. The development team wanted to develop a story-driven game in
                          the style of the first two entries in the series, while featuring content and combat from previous
                          Xeno entries. The gameplay combines elements from the first and second entries. Like the first two
                          entries, the game was localized by Nintendo of Europe. Xenoblade Chronicles 3 takes place in
                          Aionios, where two warring nations, Keves and Agnus, engage in perpetual war fought by soldiers
                          with ten-year lifespans. The story follows Noah and his two childhood friends, Eunie and Lanz, who
                          are from Keves, and Mio and her two fellow servicemen, Sena and Taion, who are from Agnus. They
                          gain the power of Ouroboros and decide to cooperate to find safety. Through this journey, they
                          uncover the mystery behind the perpetual war and the true nature of their world.

                          awry in the sky in Jordan Peele’s latest visually and thematically ambitious film Nope. OJ (Daniel
                          Kaluuya) is the head wrangler of Heywood Hollywood Horses, an intergenerational, Black-owned and
                          now struggling ranch that specializes in training horses for the big screen. But it is his sister
                          Emerald (Keke Palmer) who notices that Ghost, one of their family’s veteran equine actors, is
                          unexpectedly standing in an outdoor pen staring out into space, his light grey fur as sublime as
                          the moonlight. Ghost jumps the fence and gallops away, saying “nope” in his own way. As a
                          subversive Western science fiction kaleidoscope, Nope challenges viewers to consider technology,
                          surveillance, other worldly life and the making of spectacle through different lenses — including
                          the eyes of animals. The result is an unsettling view that exposes core ethical questions about
                          animals’ work in films, including in Nope itself.

                          basketball coach Ken Carter, who made headlines in 1999 for suspending his undefeated high school
                          basketball team due to poor academic results.[2][3][4] The story was conceived from a screenplay
                          co-written by John Gatins and Mark Schwahn. The ensemble cast features Rob Brown, Channing Tatum,
                          Debbi Morgan, Robert Ri'chard and singer Ashanti. The film was a co-production between the motion

                          rental market, it was commercially distributed by Paramount Pictures. The film explores

                          was composed and orchestrated by musician Trevor Rabin. Coach Carter was released in the United

                          August 5. The conversational AI is designed to converse with humans about “nearly any topic.” Like
                          Blender Bot 2, the latest upgrade also features the ability to browse the internet, is trained on
                          the OPT-175B language model (which is 58x the size of Blender Bot 2), and has long-term memory. It

                          improve its conversational skills and safety through feedback from people who chat with it,
                          focusing on helpful feedback while avoiding learning from unhelpful or dangerous responses.” Well,

                          seems like Blender Bot 3 cannot differentiate between what is acceptable and what is not. At least
                          that’s what its recent responses to some people conveyed.

                          the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model is GPT-4.
                          There is a free version of ChatGPT that only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version,

                          utilize ChatGPT, although others may limit the use of the AI-powered tool. Most recently, Microsoft
                          announced at it’s 2023 Build conference that it is integrating it ChatGPT-based Bing experience
                          into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startup Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT to produce
                          holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT. And nonprofit organization Solana officially
                          integrated the chatbot into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help

                          ChatGPT, Bard is a chatbot that will answer questions in natural language. Google announced at its
                          2023 I/O event that it will soon be adding multimodal content to Bard, meaning that it can deliver
                          answers in more than just text, responses can give you rich visuals as well.

                          Iowa residents once again have the inside edge on grabbing tickets to Major League Baseball’s game
                          at the “Field of Dreams” movie site later this summer. Fans with an Iowa zip code can enter a
                          public registration for a ticket lottery for this year's Major League Baseball game between the
                          Cincinnati Reds and Chicago Cubs on Aug. 11 in Dyersville. The registration takes place through
                          June 9 on the event website. Winners of the lottery will be notified on June 15. They’ll have an
                          opportunity to purchase two tickets and one parking pass to the game. The game will be played at a
                          specially constructed park built near the field from the iconic 1989 movie starring Kevin Costner.
                          Costner plays an Iowa farmer who plows over his corn to build a baseball field for Joe Jackson and
                          other members of the banished Chicago White Sox to play on. Iowans got a chance to purchase tickets
                          to last year's game as well through a special lottery. The ones that made it were treated to a
                          historic show. Costner was part of a touching tribute, appearing out of the corn and greeting
                          members of the Chicago White Sox and New York Yankees during a picture-perfect Iowa evening.

                          By Susan Bradley, Contributing Writer, Computerworld | Windows 11 22H2, released two weeks ago, is
                          another step closer to being an acceptable upgrade to Windows 10. But many Windows users aren't yet
                          being offered it for download. It's important to understand that we're in the “seeker” era for
                          Windows 11 22H2. Microsoft still has a variety of hardware and third-party issues to work through,
                          which is why you might not get offered 22H2 right away. But there is a mechanism you can use to
                          review any hard blocks on your system. (If you want to get 22H2 sooner rather than later, you could
                          opt into the Insider release track, which ensures you get the beta versions of Windows 11 — but
                          that also exposes your hardware to possible bugs, side effects, and other issues.) Courtesy of Adam
                          Gross, you can use a GitHub script to determine exactly why your system is not being offered 22H2.
                          You can either download the PowerShell script from the Github site or follow these commands to
                          determine what might be blocking Windows 11 22H@ from showing up on your hardware.. First, search
                          for PowerShell and then right-mouse click and run as administrator. In an administrator PowerShell
                          session, type in the following: Install-Module FU.

                          You won't have to wait much longer to learn more about AMD's Ryzen 7000 desktop processors. The
                          company has announced that it will unveil the new CPU line in a YouTube livestream on August 29th
                          at 7PM. The event will share more about the new Zen 4 architecture and the supporting AM5 platform.
                          There are already some clues as to what to expect. AMD inadvertently shared some of the first Ryzen
                          7000 model numbers on its website in July, including one Ryzen 5 chip (7600X), one Ryzen 7 variant
                          (7700X) and two Ryzen 9 releases (7900X and 7950X). As with past launches, the company appears
                          focused on gaming-friendly enthusiast CPUs while leaving budget parts for later releases. Zen 4 and
                          AM5, meanwhile, promise meaningful architectural changes. You'll see more Level 2 cache, boost
                          speeds beyond 5GHz, AI hardware acceleration and support for newer standards like DDR5 memory and
                          PCIe 5.0 expansion. AMD claimed a 15 percent boost to single-threaded performance in early testing.
                          Effectively, AMD is responding to Intel's 12th-gen Core — it's just a question of whether or not
                          Ryzen 7000 is fast enough to keep up or edge ahead.

                          Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Tesla’s price for the feature it calls “full
                          self-driving” has increased again. This time to $15,000, making it an unusually expensive option
                          for a car. “After wide release of FSD Beta 10.69.2, price of FSD will rise to $15k in North America
                          on September 5,” Musk tweeted last month. The release of the new software version was delayed on
                          Monday until “probably end of week. Needs a bit more polish,” Musk said, but the price increase
                          took effect. Some Tesla owners who paid far less for an earlier, unfinished version of the same

                          beta and the overwhelming majority, 11 people, said they felt it wasn’t worth $15,000. These
                          drivers say the software has improved, but not enough to warrant the price. They describe at times
                          having to pay more attention while using “full self-driving” than when driving on their own, as the
                          car can be unpredictable. More than 100,000 Tesla vehicles have been sold with the feature.

                          House of the Dragon is an American fantasy drama television series created by George R. R. Martin
                          and Ryan Condal for HBO. A prequel to Game of Thrones (2011–2019), it is the second television
                          series in the A Song of Ice and Fire franchise. Condal and Miguel Sapochnik served as the
                          showrunners for the first season. Based on parts of Martin's 2018 book Fire & Blood, the series
                          begins about 100 years after the Seven Kingdoms are united by the Targaryen Conquest, nearly 200
                          years before the events of Game of Thrones, and 172 years before the birth of Daenerys Targaryen.
                          Featuring an ensemble cast, the show portrays the events leading up to the beginning of the decline
                          of House Targaryen, a devastating war of succession known as the "Dance of the Dragons". House of
                          the Dragon received a straight-to-series order in October 2019, with casting beginning in July 2020
                          and principal photography starting in April 2021 in the United Kingdom. The series premiered on
                          August 21, 2022, with the first season consisting of ten episodes. Five days after its premiere,
                          the series was renewed for a second season. Sapochnik departed as showrunner after the first
                          season, leaving Condal to serve as the sole showrunner for the second season.

                          operator, according to The Hollywood Report. “House of the Dragon” has big shoes to fill as it is

                          nearly 90% higher than in June. While the premiere’s success is a win for HBO Max, analysts and
                          investors will likely keep a close eye on the new series. It is important that audience metrics
                          continue the momentum over the course of the 10-episode series, especially since the new Warner

                          Weprin Media & Business Writer Golf legends Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy are getting into the
                          technology and entertainment space, launching a new venture called TMRW Sports that they say will
                          develop “progressive approaches to sports, media, and entertainment.” The duo are partnering with
                          veteran sports media executive Mike McCarley on the venture, which counts former NBC Sports
                          chairman Dick Ebersol as an investor. “Since I retired, I’ve refused any real work besides giving
                          advice for plenty of friends, but this is the right idea at the right time with one of the few
                          people I would do this with,” Ebersol said in a statement. “Mike and I have remained close and
                          knowing him, his impeccable track record in business and, most importantly, witnessing firsthand
                          the way he approaches relationships — I would bet on anything he creates. So, when he told me about
                          his vision for what he was building with Tiger and Rory, I couldn’t wait to find a way to get
                          involved.” Related Stories Lifestyle Former Hollywood Exec Julie Uhrman on Why Being President of

Question 106              : Who is the Heisman Trophy winner in 2022?

  - Source              :
                          Lead Draft Writer USC quarterback Caleb Williams won the 2022 Heisman Trophy on Saturday night,
                          earning college football's most treasured individual honor in his first year with the Trojans.
                          Williams beat out the other three finalists -- Ohio State's C.J. Stroud, TCU's Max Duggan and
                          Georgia's Stetson Bennett -- in what was the first all-quarterback group of Heisman finalists since
                          2018. Duggan finished second in the voting, receiving 1,420 points to Williams' 2,031. Stroud
                          finished third (539 points) and Bennett fourth (349 points). It marks the 11th time in the last 13
                          years that a quarterback has won the award. "To now be a part of this historic fraternity is truly
                          an honor and something I will cherish for the rest of my life," Williams said during his acceptance
                          speech at Saturday night's ceremony in New York City. "While this may be an individual award, I
                          certainly understand that nothing -- and absolutely nothing -- in this sport, nor life, is done
                          alone." Williams currently leads the FBS in passing touchdowns (37) and ranks fourth in pass yards
                          (4,075). He and Lincoln Riley both left Oklahoma following the 2021 season and settled at USC,
                          helping to quickly turn the program around.

                          Ewers has more raw talent than 99% of college football quarterbacks, yet he may be in danger of
                          losing his starting job to freshman sensation Arch Manning. Both Manning and Ewing are big names to
                          keep an eye on in the Heisman odds market. Cade Klubnik, the Clemson quarterback, is currently
                          +1400 to win the Heisman Trophy. Klubnik finally took over for DJ Uiagalelei at the end of last
                          season, and Clemson’s offense seemed instantly more cohesive. If Klubnik can return the Clemson
                          offense to its one-time status as a playoff-caliber unit, he will have a firm place in the Heisman
                          discussion. A Klubnik Heisman win would be historic for the Tigers, as no Clemson player – not even
                          Deshaun Watson or Trevor Lawrence – has ever won the Heisman. Drake Maye, the North Carolina
                          quarterback, is currently +1600 to win the Heisman Trophy. Like Sam Howell before him, Maye put up
                          big numbers in Mack Brown’s UNC offense in 2022. As a result, he earned a handful of Heisman votes.
                          North Carolina may have hit its ceiling last year, reaching the ACC championship game before losing
                          to Clemson, 38-10. Maye wasn’t even a Heisman finalist. Given how last year unfolded, it’s fair to
                          wonder what the path to the top spot is for Maye.

Question 108              : Who is the chairman of Toulouse and under whose ownership are they currently?
Correct Answers         :  
                          Damien Comolli

                          20 Toulouse are newly restored to the French top flight. A club that appeared to be sinking without
                          a trace as French domestic football shut down prematurely, paralysed by the pandemic, in the spring
                          of 2020 is enjoying a renaissance on and off the pitch under American ownership and the
                          chairmanship of Damien Comolli. Advertisement Philippe Montanier’s side, the youngest and least
                          experienced team in the division, are still unbeaten after their first three matches and attacking
                          life at the higher level with all the vim and vigour which saw them establish records for
                          goalscoring while claiming Ligue 2 last term. The Athletic was invited to spend time behind the
                          scenes at a club reborn, talking to those who have instigated the upturn in fortunes and others who
                          have embraced it. The first of two articles, Rising from the Ashes, detailed the story of that
                          revival following the purchase of “Le TeFeCe” by RedBird Capital Partners, a United States-based
                          investment fund valued at over $6billion (£5.1bn), a little over two years ago. The second looks at
                          the innovative techniques Toulouse have implemented, and the sporting partnerships they are
                          forging, as they seek to maintain momentum and re-establish themselves at the top level. Theirs is
                          a bold approach, on and off the pitch.

                          Salzburg were able to persuade UEFA — amid broad skepticism — that energy drinks giant Red Bull did
                          not control both clubs. Any club’s ban opens the door for others to be included. Fifth-place La

                          the script. But how is the film coming along and what do the key creatives have in store? Lawrence
                          said in an interview with Collider that the BioShock video game series is both visually and
                          thematically appealing, which makes it a natural fit for a film. "There's real ideas and
                          philosophies underneath the game property, and it's really, really, really thought out. A lot of
                          games may have a great world of some kind, or they may have a great lead character, or they may tee
                          you up for great set-pieces, but they don't really have the ideas, they don't have the kind of
                          weight and the gravitas that Bioshock does," Lawrence said. You need a javascript enabled browser

Question 112              : Who won the World Cup Final in 2022?
Correct Answers         :  
                          Argentina
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - Source              :
                          Mbappe’s efforts in the final, and throughout the tournament, would have usually been enough to
                          coast to triumph but Messi’s magic proved to be too much. The Golden Boot provides a consolation
                          for the young Frenchman but, understandably, he was less than impressed to be forced into posing
                          with the trophy. His hat-trick in the final — the first since 1966 — brought his 2022 World Cup
                          tally to eight goals, one more than club team-mate Messi. Mbappe now has 12 goals at World Cup
                          finals, leaving him just four behind the all-time leading goalscorer Miroslav Klose. It feels like
                          2026, with its expanded format, will be the year that he smashes that record to pieces. For now,
                          the 23-year-old won’t be particularly excited by picking up one of football’s great individual
                          accolades but a Golden Boot should never be sniffed at. While Messi will forever be the hero of the
                          2022 World Cup final, he has his goalkeeper to thank once again for winning trophies on the
                          international stage. Advertisement Like he did in last year’s Copa America, Emiliano Martinez
                          hammered home his authority as the best goalkeeper at a tournament and picked up the Golden Glove
                          in Qatar. He was the star of two penalty shootouts — including the biggest of them all — as
                          Argentina got their hands on the trophy.

                          It did, according to the game’s officials and England won 4-2. The 1970 final marked Pelé’s last
                          World Cup appearance as he secured his third title in Brazil’s swashbuckling victory over Italy.
                          Four years later in Munich, host West Germany came from behind to win 2-1 against a star-studded
                          Netherlands team – made up of Johan Cruyff and Johan Neeskens – to win its second World Cup. Much
                          like Messi at Qatar 2022, Diego Maradona almost single-handedly drove his team to its second title
                          in eight years, beating West Germany 3-2 in the final. In 1998, France hosted and won its first
                          World Cup, mainly down to the genius of Zinedine Zidane, who scored twice in the final, to beat a
                          formidable Brazil side, composed of Ronaldo, Rivaldo, Cafu, Bebeto and Roberto Carlos. However,
                          with its multiples story lines and the drama and artistry on display, surely the 2022 showpiece now

                          Activision Blizzard in 2013 (freeing that company from Vivendi Universal), but those shares will be
                          purchased by Microsoft in its $68.7 billion bid for the Call of Duty publisher. Sony’s investment
                          reflects its ongoing effort to acquire or strengthen ties to studios well known for making

                          TORONTO -- Serena Williams wore her game face when she stepped out into the stadium for her first
                          match since telling the world she is ready to leave professional tennis. Greeted by a standing
                          ovation, the 23-time Grand Slam champion didn't smile. She didn't wave. She took a sip from a
                          plastic bottle as she walked in. Some folks in the crowd captured the moment with the cameras on
                          their cellphones. Others held aloft hand-drawn signs -- oh, so many signs -- with messages such as
                          "Queen'' or "Thank you.'' No one knows exactly how many more matches Williams will play before she
                          puts her rackets away for good, but the 40-year-old American exited the National Bank Open on
                          Wednesday night with a 6-2, 6-4 loss to Belinda Bencic. While there were some familiar fist pumps
                          and yells of "Come on!'' during competition, it was only afterward that Williams really allowed her
                          feelings to show, her voice shaking and her eyes welling during an on-court interview when Bencic
                          ceded the spotlight. "A lot of emotions, obviously,'' Williams told spectators who offered her
                          encouragement throughout the clear, 75-degree evening. The second-round match at the hard-court
                          tuneup for the US Open came a day after she announced "the countdown has begun'' on her playing
                          career, saying she wants to have another child and pursue business interests.

                          "Queen'' or "Thank you.'' No one knows exactly how many more matches Williams will play before she
                          puts her rackets away for good, but the 40-year-old American exited the National Bank Open on
                          Wednesday night with a 6-2, 6-4 loss to Belinda Bencic. While there were some familiar fist pumps
                          and yells of "Come on!'' during competition, it was only afterward that Williams really allowed her
                          feelings to show, her voice shaking and her eyes welling during an on-court interview when Bencic
                          ceded the spotlight. "A lot of emotions, obviously,'' Williams told spectators who offered her
                          encouragement throughout the clear, 75-degree evening. The second-round match at the hard-court
                          tuneup for the US Open came a day after she announced "the countdown has begun'' on her playing
                          career, saying she wants to have another child and pursue business interests.

                          It wasn't clear how many survivors had life-threatening injuries early Friday. The shuttle was
                          transporting factory workers from the Amscan Distribution Center in the Orange County town of
                          Chester to New York City. Party City confirmed it lost three employees. "It is with heavy hearts
                          that we can confirm our Chester Distribution Center team suffered the loss of three valued team
                          members early this morning," the party company said in a statement Friday. "We are deeply saddened
                          to hear of the tragic car accident that occurred and offer our most heartfelt condolences to the
                          families and friends of those affected. We pray for the recovery and healing of the additional team
                          members injured in the accident." A spokesperson said the van is not owned or operated by the
                          company, but did not provide further details. It wasn't clear if everyone else aboard worked for
                          the same company. Family members of two women who had been on the van said it was transporting
                          workers from the Chester factory of a major party goods manufacturer to Manhattan's Inwood
                          neighborhood, where workers were set to be dropped off at an employment agency. Clara Estrella had
                          recently immigrated from the Dominican Republic with her sister. Her cousins confirmed the

                          beautiful person. She came over here to have a better life," the victim's cousin, Nathaly Paulino,

                          his playing days. He was arrested in September 1990 on suspicion of criminal mischief for allegedly
                          breaking an exterior window and damaging an inner window while trying to enter his girlfriend’s
                          apartment. According to police reports, the girlfriend’s roommate told officers there had been a

Question 125              : Which companies are part of MATANA?

                          It's time to rethink who's at the top of the Big Tech food-chain, Constellation Research Principal
                          Analyst & Founder Ray Wang told Yahoo Finance Live (video above). Wang argued that MATANA —
                          Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Tesla (TSLA), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Nvidia (NVDA), and Amazon
                          (AMZN) – is an upgrade to FAANG by dropping Meta (META) and Netflix (NFLX) while adding Microsoft,
                          Tesla, and Nvidia. In 2013, when Jim Cramer of CNBC's "Mad Money" coined the term FAANG, many of
                          those companies were thought of as upstarts who'd taken their respective markets by storm. This was
                          especially true of Meta — then Facebook — and Netflix. But now, Wang said, both should be
                          re-assessed. Meta, in particular, needs a new plan. "Facebook has got to do something besides ads,"
                          he told Yahoo Finance. "Once again, they're taking a beating for it. So, is it going to be the
                          glasses? Is it going to be the metaverse? We're not there yet and that's really kind of what the
                          challenge is." For Netflix, it's a question of growth, and what is and isn't on the table. And
                          because the company's operating on a subscription model, Wang has questions about how much further
                          they could go. "The reason they're out is because, how many more subscribers?

                          said per the release. "When the board expanded the playoff beginning in 2026 and asked the CFP
                          Management Committee to examine the feasibility of starting the new format earlier, the Management
                          Committee went right to work. "More teams and more access mean more excitement for fans, alumni,
                          students and student-athletes. We appreciate the leaders of the six bowl games and the two future
                          national championship game host cities for their cooperation. Everyone realized that this change is
                          in the best interest of college football and pulled together to make it happen." MORE: College

                          20 years. The attacking options speak for themselves. As he has done since stepping onto the world
                          stage, Neymar will carry the expectations of a nation but will have Real Madrid’s Vinicuis Jr. and

                          as consistent over the last four years as the two South American giants and this consistency means
                          that there is a good chance of one of them prevailing.” It’s rare that an underdog wins the World

                          England in the Euro 2020 semifinals, the team waltzed through World Cup qualification, winning nine

                          U.S. Marshals wanted poster for Leonard Francis An international manhunt continued Tuesday for
                          Leonard Glenn Francis, a former defense contractor and convicted mastermind of a
                          multimillion-dollar U.S. Navy corruption case who fled custody from home detention Sunday morning,
                          just weeks before he was to be sentenced to federal prison. Francis, a Malaysian national and the
                          former president of Singapore-based Glenn Defense Marine Asia, was convicted in 2015 after taking a
                          plea deal in exchange for helping U.S. prosecutors implicate three-dozen military officials. Since
                          at least 2018, he has been living in home detention in San Diego under court-approved “medical
                          furloughs” for treatment of renal cancer and other health issues, according to federal court
                          documents. He was scheduled to be sentenced on Sept. 22 before District Court Judge Janis
                          Sammartino. But at about 7:30 a.m. Sunday, the GPS tracker affixed to Francis’ ankle alerted
                          federal monitors that it “was being tampered with,” a U.S. Marshals Service official told USNI
                          News. That alert prompted monitors with U.S. Pretrial Services to check on his status, which, per
                          protocols, means ruling out scenarios including a faulty tracker. That agency handles all federal
                          defendants on pretrial or pre-sentencing release. “They just can’t assume somebody is on the run
                          and call U.S. Marshals,” said Supervisory Deputy U.S. Marshal Omar Castillo, with the U.S.

                          present at the event. Content At last year's Meta Connect, Meta teased a standalone premium headset
                          codenamed Project Cambria. Since the packaging leaked, we know that the product will be called Meta
                          Quest Pro. Mark Zuckerberg confirmed that the headset will be unveiled at Meta Connect 2022 and
                          that Quest Pro will go on sale before the end of October. Meta Quest Pro is a new product line that
                          focuses on work and productivity as well as virtual meetings and is aimed at enterprises,
                          professionals, and developers. The headset offers new, forward-thinking hardware features from
                          Meta's research labs. In the case of the first Meta Quest Pro, these include custom-made pancake
                          lenses, a high-quality passthrough mode, eye and face tracking, and self-tracking VR controllers.

                          VR games can then be streamed to the Meta Quest 2 via Air Link without a router or network setup.
                          Meta and D-Link are expected to announce the price and release date of the accessory at Meta
                          Connect 2022. The "VR Air Bridge" was developed in cooperation with Meta. | Image: D-Link It is
                          possible that Meta will also announce a native PC VR interface for Meta Quest 2 as part of this
                          initiative. Anyone who connects to a PC via Quest Link today is presented with the outdated Rift
                          user interface - not an optimal solution. Meta promised better PC-VR integration at Connect 2020,
                          but the plans remained lip service. The next big step toward high-end VR graphics is cloud
                          streaming. Meta is rumored to be testing its own VR streaming service called Avalanche, and Air
                          Bridge is expected to play a major role in those plans. The company could announce a closed beta
                          test or something similar at Meta Connect 2022. Augmented reality: will we see Meta’s first AR
                          headset? At last year's event, Zuckerberg teased Project Nazare: Meta's first AR headset. The
                          company only showed a brief simulation of what avatar holograms might look like through the AR
                          headset. According to a roadmap leak, three generations of the AR headset were scheduled for 2024,
                          2026, and 2028. But in June, it was said that the first version would no longer be commercialized
                          and would instead be distributed free of charge to developers.

                          Hardware Image: Mark Zuckerberg / Instagram Meta is likely to reveal more about the rumoured Meta
                          Quest Pro VR device at the annual Meta Connect showcase, taking place in October 2022. This headset
                          is set to be the next iteration of the popular VR device line, and is said to support mixed reality
                          experiences, while also having higher visual fidelity than its predecessors. The device, which may
                          actually be the mystery Meta device codenamed ‘Project Cambria’, will reportedly launch by the end
                          of 2022, and could be a more better-featured, more refined option when compared to the current Meta
                          Quest 2 device. It will also likely carry a more expensive price tag. In a recent episode of the
                          Joe Rogan Experience, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg appeared to enthuse about a ‘Quest Pro’ with
                          features including eye and facial tracking being discussed, as well as the ability to sync up a
                          digital avatar for more lifelike social interactions. Zuckerberg later teased the device in a post
                          on Meta. Read: New details confirmed for PlayStation VR 2, including ‘see-through view’ It’s
                          currently unclear how far along the rumoured Meta Quest Pro VR device is – but it’s likely we’ll
                          get a better glimpse when Meta Connect 2022 airs. This show will feature Meta’s vision for the
                          expanding ‘metaverse’ and will also introduce a number of innovations from leaders in the AR, VR
                          and XR spaces.

                          Gotham Knights is a 2022 action role-playing game developed by WB Games Montréal and published by
                          Warner Bros. Games. Inspired by the Batman: Gotham Knights comic series and based on the DC Comics
                          character Batman and his supporting cast, the game focuses on the characters Nightwing, Batgirl,
                          Robin, and Red Hood as they attempt to restore justice to Gotham City during a period of decline in
                          the immediate aftermath of Batman's death. While investigating the events that led to their
                          mentor's demise, the heroes become embroiled in an ancient conflict between two secret
                          organizations fighting for control of Gotham: the Court of Owls and the League of Shadows. Gameplay
                          is presented from the third-person perspective with a primary focus on using each playable
                          character's traversal and combat abilities to defeat enemies and explore the environment. Players
                          can freely move around Gotham City, interacting with characters, undertaking missions, and gaining
                          experience points and other resources to level up their characters and equipment. Outside of the
                          story, players are able to complete side missions to unlock additional content and collectible
                          items. A cooperative online multiplayer mode is also included, allowing two players to play through
                          the single-player campaign together while progressing in their own game. Gotham Knights was
                          released on October 21, 2022, for PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series X/S. Versions for the
                          PlayStation 4 and Xbox One were also planned, but were ultimately cancelled.

                          George Bernard Shaw (26 July 1856 – 2 November 1950), known at his insistence as Bernard Shaw, was
                          an Irish playwright, critic, polemicist and political activist. His influence on Western theatre,
                          culture and politics extended from the 1880s to his death and beyond. He wrote more than sixty
                          plays, including major works such as Man and Superman (1902), Pygmalion (1913) and Saint Joan
                          (1923). With a range incorporating both contemporary satire and historical allegory, Shaw became
                          the leading dramatist of his generation, and in 1925 was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.
                          Born in Dublin, Shaw moved to London in 1876, where he struggled to establish himself as a writer
                          and novelist, and embarked on a rigorous process of self-education. By the mid-1880s he had become
                          a respected theatre and music critic. Following a political awakening, he joined the gradualist
                          Fabian Society and became its most prominent pamphleteer. Shaw had been writing plays for years
                          before his first public success, Arms and the Man in 1894. Influenced by Henrik Ibsen, he sought to
                          introduce a new realism into English-language drama, using his plays as vehicles to disseminate his
                          political, social and religious ideas.

                          Operation Unicorn, which set protocols for her death occurring in Scotland. The United Kingdom
                          observed a national mourning period of 10 days. The Queen's lying in state took place in
                          Westminster Hall from 14 to 19 September, during which time an estimated 250,000 people queued to
                          pay their respects. Elizabeth's state funeral on 19 September was the first held in Britain since
                          Winston Churchill's in 1965. A funeral service was held at Westminster Abbey, followed by a
                          procession to Wellington Arch that featured around 3,000 military personnel and was watched by
                          around a million people in central London. The state hearse then transported the Queen's coffin to
                          Windsor, followed by another procession through Windsor Great Park and a committal service at St
                          George's Chapel at Windsor Castle.

                          Elizabeth II (Elizabeth Alexandra Mary; 21 April 1926 – 8 September 2022) was Queen of the United
                          Kingdom and other Commonwealth realms from 6 February 1952 until her death in 2022. She was queen
                          regnant of 32 sovereign states over the course of her lifetime and remained the monarch of 15
                          realms by the time of her death. Her reign of over 70 years is the longest of any British monarch
                          and the longest verified reign of any female head of state in history. Elizabeth was born in
                          Mayfair, London, as the first child of the Duke and Duchess of York (later King George VI and Queen
                          Elizabeth The Queen Mother). Her father acceded to the throne in 1936 upon the abdication of his
                          brother Edward VIII, making the ten-year-old Princess Elizabeth the heir presumptive. She was
                          educated privately at home and began to undertake public duties during the Second World War,
                          serving in the Auxiliary Territorial Service. In November 1947, she married Philip Mountbatten, a
                          former prince of Greece and Denmark, and their marriage lasted 73 years until his death in 2021.
                          They had four children: Charles, Anne, Andrew, and Edward.

                          serve on 80% of occasions, an elite ratio. He is also elite at taking advantage of break point
                          chances, converting 46% on 0.85 per game compared to 39% on 0.57 per game for Tiafoe in the
                          tournament. Tiafoe is the first American man to make the US Open semifinal since 2006, and he
                          upended Rafael Nadal, a 22-time grand slam winner, earlier in the field. Tiafoe has the rest

                          overnight — it was a chance to be part of a historic event. Julie Newman, a 77-year-old visitor
                          from Canada, said the royal procession had been “absolutely fabulous. Couldn’t ask for anything

                          a republic gathered to holler “Not my king.” They see the monarchy as an institution that stands
                          for privilege and inequality, in a country of deepening poverty and fraying social ties. A handful
                          were arrested. WATCH: Pageantry and protests surround coronation of King Charles III As the day
                          began, the abbey buzzed with excitement and was abloom with fragrant flowers and colorful hats.

                          scepter and had the solid gold, bejeweled St. Edward’s Crown placed atop his head as he sat upon a
                          700-year-old oak chair. In front of world leaders, foreign royals, dignitaries and a smattering of
                          stars, the monarch declared, “I come not to be served but to serve,” and was presented as Britain’s
                          “undoubted king.” Inside the medieval abbey, trumpets sounded, and the congregation of more than
                          2,000 shouted “God save the king!” Outside, thousands of troops, hundreds of thousands of
                          spectators and scores of protesters converged. It was the culmination of a seven-decade journey for
                          the king from heir to monarch.

                          unmatched around the world. To the crowds gathered under rainy skies — thousands of whom had camped

                          better.” “But we’re ready to go back home and watch it all on the television,” she added. But to
                          millions more, the day was greeted with a shrug, the awe and reverence the ceremony was designed to
                          evoke largely gone. And to a few, it was reason to protest. Hundreds who want to see Britain become
                          a republic gathered to holler “Not my king.” They see the monarchy as an institution that stands
                          for privilege and inequality, in a country of deepening poverty and fraying social ties. A handful
                          were arrested. WATCH: Pageantry and protests surround coronation of King Charles III As the day
                          began, the abbey buzzed with excitement and was abloom with fragrant flowers and colorful hats.

                          a collection of greatest hits and studio albums that have been certified by the Recording Industry
                          Association of America. He also has a host of Academy of Country Music Awards, in addition to
                          Grammy Award nominations. But the "You're Gonna Miss This" singer admitted he was a little
                          intimidated to work with legendary actress Susan Sarandon in their upcoming country music drama
                          about a dynasty of singers in "Monarch." Adkins portrays Albie Roman alongside Sarandon, who plays
                          Dottie Cantrell Roman, in the series, which is set to debut in September on FOX, and marks his
                          first starring role. He told Fox News Digital that working with Sarandon was "terrifying," but he
                          knew he was learning the ropes from a true icon. "It was terrifying at first, but then very quickly
                          I realized that she is so good, so professional, that she is going to carry the scene," Adkins
                          said. "You just try to hang on and make it to the buzzer, and she’ll take care of it. When asked
                          what it was like to kiss the Academy Award-winning actress, he simply replied: "It was an honor.

                          role, even though his friends Blake Shelton and Tim McGraw have years of TV experience. Blake has

                          iPhone 14 and October 7 for the iPhone 14 Plus.[22] The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus have an
                          identical design to the iPhone 13, although the US models lack a physical SIM tray. The iPhone 14
                          and iPhone 14 Plus are available in six colors: Blue, Purple, Midnight, Starlight, Yellow, and
                          Product Red.[24] Purple is a new color replacing Pink used on the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini. The
                          yellow option was added on March 7, 2023.[25] iPhone 14 and 14 Plus are available in three internal
                          storage configurations: 128, 256, and 512 GB. Both models have 6 GB of RAM, an increase over the
                          previous iPhone 13 and 13 mini models' 4 GB of RAM. The iPhone 14 and 14 Plus have the same IP68
                          rating for dust and water resistance as their predecessors.[6] The iPhone 14 and 14 Plus use a
                          5-nanometer Apple-designed system on a chip, the A15 Bionic, while the iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max
                          have a faster A16 Bionic.[26][27] The iPhone 14's A15 chip has a 6-core CPU, 5-core GPU, and a

                          hadn’t used the Plus name since 2017, but it resurrected it in 2022 with the iPhone 14 Plus. Just
                          like before, the new model increases the screen size of the standard one, but keeps the majority of
                          the other technical features in place. It fits in that awkward space between the cheaper iPhone 14
                          and the slightly more expensive, but superior Pro model. But is there any real reason to buy it?
                          The iPhone 14 Plus is wider, taller, and heavier than the iPhone 14, and the only dimension that
                          stays the same is the thickness at 7.8mm. Made from aluminum and glass, it’s a step down in luxury
                          from the stainless steel and glass Pro models, but with this comes the advantage of low weight. At
                          203 grams, the iPhone 14 Plus can’t be called light, but it’s lighter than the iPhone 14 Pro and
                          only a few grams heavier than the Samsung Galaxy S22+. My usual iPhone of choice is the iPhone 14
                          Pro, and I’ve been consistently surprised at how light the iPhone 14 Plus feels when I pick it up,
                          despite the larger screen and body, as well as the scant 3-gram real-world difference between them.

                          The problem begins with Clemons. A film like Susie Searches demands a star turn, high voltage,
                          explosively quirky nerdery and histrionics. Think Flick, Nicole Kidman in To Die For, or either
                          lead in Agnieszka Smoczynska’s recent The Silent Twins. Clemons is mute, blank, inexpressive,
                          bored, taciturn, seeming even resentful of being there. Wolff clearly dislikes the type of zoomer
                          he’s portraying, delivering a good deal of his lines with embarrassed insecurity. The film is not a
                          failure in toto, but its failure to launch can only be credited to Kargman. The edit is the film’s
                          most disastrous component, frequently cutting away from critical reactions and lingering too long
                          on silence, stillness, and useless moments of transition. Kargman knew what type of movie she
                          wanted to make, and she more or less made one. All the parts are there, yet the intrepid detective
                          still struggles to understand how they connect. Little White Lies is committed to championing great

                          clues, eying a convenient creep (Ken Marino) as a suspect, or scouting out evidence, Susie is on a
                          mission to save the day…and promote herself. Forget the hardscrabble detectives of film noir; Susie
                          has more in common with Oliver Putnam than she does Sam Spade. Rather than a gun and a trench coat,
                          she carries a big smile smacked with colorful braces and a disarming demeanor that tends to make
                          people underestimate her. She seems childish for a college student and ridiculous as an
                          investigator. But!

  - Source              :
                          By Alex Zietlow Kyle Busch is moving from one storied racing team to another. The multi-time NASCAR
                          Cup Series champion will join Richard Childress Racing in 2023, according to a report from Jordan
                          Bianchi of The Athletic. The move ends a successful 15-year tenure with Joe Gibbs Racing. An
                          official announcement is expected Tuesday, per the report. The news punctuates an eventful and
                          “stressful” regular season for Busch, whose free agency dominated headlines and clouded a
                          playoff-caliber season in 2022. It did so because his looming free agency revealed a strange
                          reality in NASCAR economics — that one of the sport’s biggest stars would have to struggle to find
                          a home (even with taking a pay cut) because of something outside of his control. That “something”
                          outside of his control, in this case, was the result of the Mars Inc. decision to exit NASCAR at
                          the end of the year, leaving Joe Gibbs Racing (Busch’s current team) without a primary sponsor for
                          Busch’s No. 18 team. Busch confirmed to reporters earlier this month that he had “more than one”
                          team extend official contract offers to him. RCR was among those companies, per reports at the
                          time. He also said that his uncertain future had been weighing on him. “It weighs on you every
                          time, every day of the week,” Busch said at NASCAR’s playoff media day before the race at
                          Darlington.

                          His career average finish is 13.8, and no full-time RCR driver has reached that mark since Ryan
                          Newman in 2015. And on top of driving for RCR, his deal is also leading him to swap manufacturers
                          for Kyle Busch Motorsports in the Craftsman Truck Series. His team will be branded by Chevrolet in
                          2023, a major overhaul with Chase Purdy and Jack Wood joining the team. Fortunately for Busch, he
                          will not have to worry about finding sponsors at RCR. 3CHI, Alsco, BetMGM, Cheddars and Lenovo have
                          all confirmed they will sponsor the No. 8 car. And if anyone can bring back a championship trophy

Question 144              : What is men's year-end No 1 in tennis in 2022?

  - Source              :
                          The Pepperstone ATP rankings[1] are the Association of Tennis Professionals' (ATP) merit-based
                          system for determining the rankings in men's tennis. The top-ranked player is the player who, over
                          the previous 52 weeks, has garnered the most ranking points on the ATP Tour. Points are awarded
                          based on how far a player advances in tournaments and the category of those tournaments. The ATP
                          has used a computerized system for determining the rankings since August 23, 1973.[2] Starting in
                          1979, an updated rankings list is released at the beginning of each week. Since 1973, 28 players
                          have been ranked No. 1 by the ATP,[3][4] of which 17 have been year-end No. 1. The current world
                          number one is Carlos Alcaraz. Since the introduction of the rankings, the method used to calculate
                          a player's ranking points has changed several times. As of 2019, the rankings are calculated by
                          totaling the points a player wins in his best eighteen tournaments, subject to certain
                          restrictions. For top players the counting tournaments are the four Grand Slam tournaments, the
                          eight mandatory ATP Masters tournaments, the non-mandatory ATP Masters 1000 event in Monte-Carlo,
                          the player's best four eligible ATP Tour 500 tournaments and his best two results from ATP Tour 250
                          tournaments.

                          an unexpected turn of events. Titans season 4 spoilers follow. Titans has delivered a hugely
                          shocking twist in its season 4 premiere. No sooner had Lex Luthor (Titus Welliver) entered the fray
                          did he exit in dramatic fashion, being surprisingly killed off while meeting with son Conner Kent
                          (Joshua Orpin). In the newly-released premiere, the supervillain suddenly started to spit up blood
                          before dying, and showrunner Greg Walker has admitted that even he is "disappointed" by the
                          all-too-brief appearance. Related: The Originals star supervillain look revealed in Titans season 4

                          they were only allowed limited use of Luthor by DC. Walker added that bigger characters tend "to
                          gobble up a lot of Titans stories". "Not that they would have given us more than one episode [of
                          Lex], but we also wanted to focus on the Titans," he continued. “And as you will see, this season
                          really focuses on the Titans and their relationships with each other.

                          With the costume, my idea was that Albert Einstein was known to have multiple pairs of the same
                          trousers, shirts and coats because he did not want to muddle himself with things that he considered
                          to be trivial, like picking out clothing. He wasn’t concerned with that. It wasn’t his genius
                          saying, “I’m so smart. I don’t have time to pick up my clothing.” It was something that vexxed him.
                          So I said, I think Lex is the same. I think he has multiple black suits that he wears, multiple
                          black shirts and ties. That’s his thing. He doesn’t think about that. When he gets up, takes a
                          shower does his thing and goes in, and there’s no thought about it. But I wanted him to be really
                          kind of streamlined. I wanted him to look not like he’s slovenly, of “I’ve got 10 pairs of khakis
                          and a white shirt.” I’m simple, but I’m pressed because, for him, it’s also all about presentation.
                          I said, when this guy enters a room, he doesn’t move for anybody. So it was important to have that
                          silhouette. I thought also a lot about — and I spoke with the producers about this — parallels to
                          the character of Colonel Walter Kurtz who Marlon Brando plays in Apocalypse Now. I kept saying,
                          hey, when there are opportunities, maybe let’s not reveal Luthor physically right away.

                          shocking twist in its season 4 premiere. No sooner had Lex Luthor (Titus Welliver) entered the fray
                          did he exit in dramatic fashion, being surprisingly killed off while meeting with son Conner Kent
                          (Joshua Orpin). In the newly-released premiere, the supervillain suddenly started to spit up blood
                          before dying, and showrunner Greg Walker has admitted that even he is "disappointed" by the
                          all-too-brief appearance. Related: The Originals star supervillain look revealed in Titans season 4

                          they were only allowed limited use of Luthor by DC. Walker added that bigger characters tend "to
                          gobble up a lot of Titans stories". "Not that they would have given us more than one episode [of

                          really focuses on the Titans and their relationships with each other.

                          Gi-hun in the hit Netflix show. The show's creator, Hwang Dong-hyuk, won the best drama series

Question 148              : How much did Google acquire Mandiant for?

                          the "brain" across organizations' myriad security products and automate protection on top of these
                          controls, according to the security shop's CEO Kevin Mandia. Mandia spoke with reporters for the
                          first time about his threat-intel-slash-incident-response company's new owner during a press

                          component of the $5.4 billion deal, he said, is that Google will allow Mandiant to remain "controls

                          monitoring tools give telemetry, and firewalls give telemetry to the brain. One of the things we

                          priority,” she said. “Companies just won’t have a seat at the table if they aren’t thinking about
                          security first because it’s a business imperative.” Experts agree: If Google wants to build out its
                          cloud business, tripling down on security is essential. "The enterprise is only as secure as its
                          least secure employee," said Ravichandran. The cybersecurity space is one that's generally been
                          deal-heavy, so looking ahead we'll likely see Big Tech, investors, and private companies strike
                          more deals in the sector, said Ravichandran. "Historically, we’ve seen fairly regular M&A in the
                          cybersecurity industry," he said. "In September alone, there were nearly 40 cybersecurity company
                          acquisitions, which signals that there is still a lot of opportunity when companies identify a
                          strategic fit." Rubin agrees, adding that these deals will grow even more important as
                          cybersecurity becomes an increasingly indispensable part of business strategies and outlooks. "The
                          Google and Mandiant deal is the latest in a string of high-profile, billion-dollar cybersecurity
                          acquisitions over the past few years, and it certainly won’t be the last," he told Yahoo Finance.
                          "If Google is willing to go 'all in' on cyber, clearly their customers believe security is core to

Question 149              : What was the inflation rate in the U.S. in August 2022?
Correct Answers         :

  - Source              :
                          Print U.S. consumer price increases eased in August compared to a year ago, the government said
                          Tuesday, but the drop was modest and may not be noticed much by financially squeezed American
                          households. The inflation rate was up at an annualized 8.3% rate in August, the Bureau of Labor
                          Statistics reported. The figure was down from the 8.5% mark recorded in July and the 9.1% inflation
                          rate in June, which was the biggest increase in four decades. Even as U.S. motorists have gladly
                          watched gasoline prices fall sharply in recent weeks — down 10.6% from their peak — costs for food
                          and apartment rentals have continued to increase. Overall, as a result, the government said that
                          consumer prices were up one-tenth of a percent in August, compared to July. Food prices were up 0.8
                          percent in the past month, while costs for housing, medical care, new cars and household
                          furnishings all increased in August compared to July. Stock investors in the United States remain
                          worried about inflation, with major indexes falling more than 2% at the opening of trading on
                          Tuesday, an hour after the release of the inflation report. President Joe Biden adopted a more
                          optimistic view, saying, "Overall, prices have been essentially flat in our country these last two
                          months. That is welcome news for American families, with more work still to do. "Gas prices are

                          Kingdom is out now worldwide exclusively for the Nintendo Switch and, unsurprisingly, it's one of
                          the biggest and most exciting games available on the platform. Tears of the Kingdom is the sequel
                          to Breath of the Wild, which is widely considered to be one of the best Switch games ever and was
                          the console's biggest launch title. In other words, Tears of the Kingdom had some big shoes to
                          fill, and it ended up being even better! In our full near-perfect The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the
                          Kingdom review we said it: "leaps forward on what was offered in 2017’s Breath of the Wild, filling
                          out the world’s sandbox with innovative new tools and abilities, letting you approach challenges in
                          inventive new ways" The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom launched on May 12, 2023.
                          Unsurprisingly for a first-party Nintendo game, it's exclusive to the Nintendo Switch console
                          family. Tears of the Kingdom was initially due to release in 2022 but, in March of that year,
                          Nintendo pushed the date into 2023, with series producer, Eiji Aonuma, telling fans it was out of a
                          desire to "extend out development time a bit". The game is now available worldwide physically and
                          digitally.

                          In the years since its release, multiple games and developers have cited Breath of the Wild as an

                          Rising,[202] Telling Lies,[203] Halo Infinite,[204] Elden Ring,[205] and Forspoken.[206]
                          Similarities have also been noted between Breath of the Wild and other open-world games since its
                          launch, including Pokémon Legends: Arceus,[207] Sonic Frontiers [208][209] and Horizon Forbidden
                          West.[210] According to Digital Trends, Breath of the Wild has become a popular point of comparison
                          among open world games.[126] The game's success sparked increased interest in the Wii U emulator
                          Cemu, as the Cemu developers rapidly updated the software to run the game at a steady frame rate
                          within weeks of release.[211][212][213] The ability to run the game in an emulator led to a
                          thriving modding scene.[214] Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity, a hack and slash game in the style
                          of Dynasty Warriors series, following 2014's Hyrule Warriors, is a spin-off of Breath of the Wild,

                          8][page needed] It was announced at E3 2019 as a sequel to Breath of the Wild.[9][10] At E3 2021,
                          Nintendo debuted a trailer revealing gameplay, story elements and a 2022 release window,[11] but
                          Nintendo later changed the release window to Q2 2023.[12][13] More information was revealed in the
                          Nintendo Direct presentation held in September 2022, including the title Tears of the Kingdom and a
                          release date of May 12, 2023.[14][15] Another Nintendo Direct in February 2023 teased more gameplay
                          elements.[16] A playable version of the game leaked online as a disk image two weeks before
                          release.[17][18] As with Breath of the Wild, Tears of the Kingdom was directed by Hidemaro
                          Fujibayashi and produced by Eiji Aonuma.[19] It was conceived after the team was unable to use
                          every idea planned for Breath of the Wild's downloadable content.[20] New elements include floating
                          islands above Hyrule, with players able to soar between them in a style similar to The Legend of
                          Zelda: Skyward Sword (2011).[21][22][23] While he was shown early demos, the involvement of the
                          Zelda creator, Shigeru Miyamoto, was reduced due to scheduling conflicts with his role as a
                          producer on The Super Mario Bros. Movie (2023).

                          “The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom” is perhaps the most highly anticipated video game of
                          the year. (In fact, it won that very award in 2022 – the wait has been long.) And by all accounts,
                          it’s living up to the hype: “Tears of the Kingdom,” released May 12, has already broken sales
                          records, earned raves from experts like IGN and longtime “Zelda” fans, and driven some fans to take
                          time off from work to dive into its intricate, enveloping world. The very first “Zelda” game was
                          released in 1986, and almost 40 years later, Link’s adventures are still enchanting gamers and

                          acclaimed game, “Breath of the Wild.” But just when he thought he could hand up his green tunic,
                          super-villain Ganondorf returns to wreak havoc, taking the wise Princess Zelda with him. Link sets
                          out to find her – and to once again save Hyrule from one of its most prevalent threats. But oh!

                          time off from work to dive into its intricate, enveloping world. The very first “Zelda” game was
                          released in 1986, and almost 40 years later, Link’s adventures are still enchanting gamers and
                          infuriating those who don’t have over 100 hours to spend discovering the game’s many hidden
                          treasures. Here’s what you need to know about the newest installment in the “Zelda” franchise, sans
                          spoilers. Link, now a knight of the kingdom of Hyrule, just got done saving Hyrule in 2017’s
                          acclaimed game, “Breath of the Wild.” But just when he thought he could hand up his green tunic,
                          super-villain Ganondorf returns to wreak havoc, taking the wise Princess Zelda with him. Link sets
                          out to find her – and to once again save Hyrule from one of its most prevalent threats. But oh!

                          2023 invites the submission of long and short papers on substantial, original, and unpublished
                          research on empirical methods for Natural Language Processing. As in recent years, some of the
                          presentations at the conference will be for papers accepted by the Transactions of the ACL (TACL)
                          and Computational Linguistics (CL) journals. EMNLP 2023 will follow EMNLP 2022 and ACL 2023 and go
                          with a hybrid format with respect to ARR. This means that while EMNLP will accept ARR-reviewed
                          papers, it will also accept submissions directly to EMNLP. However, in order to keep the review
                          load on the community as a whole manageable, we need to ask authors to decide up-front if they want
                          to be reviewed through ARR or EMNLP. Mandatory abstract submission

                          ceremony, Britain bid farewell to Queen Elizabeth II who reigned for more than 70 years. LONDON
                          (AP) — The United Kingdom and the world bade farewell to Queen Elizabeth II on Monday with a state
                          funeral that drew presidents and kings, princes and prime ministers — and crowds in the streets of
                          London and at Windsor Castle — to honor a monarch whose 70-year reign defined an age. In a country
                          known for pomp and pageantry, the first state funeral since Winston Churchill’s was filled with
                          spectacle: Before the service, a bell tolled 96 times — once a minute for each year of Elizabeth’s
                          life. Then, 142 Royal Navy sailors used ropes to draw the gun carriage carrying her flag-draped
                          coffin to Westminster Abbey, where pallbearers carried it inside and about 2,000 people ranging
                          from world leaders to health care workers gathered to mourn. The trappings of state and monarchy
                          abounded: The coffin was draped with the Royal Standard and atop it was the Imperial State Crown,
                          sparkling with almost 3,000 diamonds, and the sovereign’s orb and scepter. But the personal was
                          also present: The coffin was followed into the church by generations of Elizabeth’s descendants,
                          including King Charles III, heir to the throne Prince William and 9-year-old George, who is second
                          in line.

Question 161              : Where did Queen Elizabeth II's state funeral take place?
Correct Answers         :  
                          Westminster Abbey
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - Answer              : Westminster Abbey

  - Source              :
                          The hearse carrying Queen Elizabeth II's coffin stopped briefly as it arrived in the town of
                          Windsor, west of London, on Monday afternoon, so troops from the British Army's Grenadier Guards
                          could take their places flanking the vehicle for it's slow, final push to Windsor Castle. Once the
                          procession reaches the grounds of Windsor Castle, it will be joined by King Charles III and the
                          other senior members of the royal family. The Royal Standard, a flag representing the Sovereign and
                          the United Kingdom, was raised over Windsor Castle on Monday as the hearse carrying Queen Elizabeth
                          II's coffin made its way through west London toward Windsor. The standard always flies above any
                          royal castle or palace when the sovereign is there, so it being raised on Monday was a sign that
                          the late queen's son, King Charles III, had arrived at the royal residence ahead of the committal
                          service for his mother. Queen Elizabeth II will be laid to rest at the family's cemetery at St.
                          George's Chapel, on the Windsor Castle grounds. Queen Elizabeth II made her final procession
                          through London on Monday after the state funeral service was held for her at Westminster Abbey.
                          Throughout the process, her coffin was heavily decorated in regalia, all representing various
                          aspects of the queen's life and legacy. Royal contributor Tina Brown told CBS News that the items
                          that draped and sat on top of the queen's coffin added historic symbolism to this "moving moment.

  - Source              :
                          The Queen was interred with her husband, Prince Philip, in the King George VI Memorial Chapel later
                          that evening, in a private service attended only by her closest family. The state funeral was the
                          largest security operation ever mounted in the UK, and included dignitaries from around the world.
                          The funeral was designated as a public holiday in the UK and several Commonwealth states. The state
                          funeral was one of the United Kingdom's most watched special television broadcasts, surpassing the
                          wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton, the previous most watched royal event of the
                          21st century. The period of official mourning and the funeral was estimated to have cost the
                          government £162 million.[1] Queen Elizabeth II was in good health for most of her life; her health,
                          however, declined significantly after the death of her husband, Prince Philip, in April 2021.[2]
                          She began to use a walking stick for public engagements in October 2021.[3] On 20 October, the
                          Queen stayed overnight in King Edward VII's Hospital in central London, necessitating the
                          cancellation of scheduled visits to Northern Ireland and the COP26 summit in Glasgow. She suffered
                          a sprained back in November, which prevented her from attending the 2021 National Service of
                          Remembrance.[4][5][6][7] In February 2022, during the COVID-19 pandemic in England, the Queen was
                          one of several people at Windsor Castle to test positive for COVID-19.

                          Digital Replica Edition Trending: Three people died Saturday morning when two airplanes collided
                          over Boulder County and crashed, according to the sheriff’s office. Just before 9 a.m., emergency
                          responders received calls about two planes colliding in midair east of Niwot, the sheriff’s office
                          said in a news release. Two separate crash sites were found. Claire Brown, 22, of Longmont, was
                          working Saturday morning, feeding horses at a stable off of 95th Street and Niwot Road, when she
                          heard a loud noise. Brown looked into the sky and saw to planes close together. “At first, it
                          looked like they were under control, then they spiraled down,” Brown said. “I saw some debris
                          flying in the air too, I figured they had hit each other.” Brown heard one plane crash. She called

                          a moment, Brown said she heard sirens as responders raced to the scene. “It is definitely
                          unfortunate,” she said. “I knew those people were not alive after that. They weren’t terribly high,
                          but as they were spiraling down the nose of the plane was heading straight down, pointing straight
                          at the ground. You could tell that they had no control and that it was a bad crash. It happened so
                          fast.

                          Giorgia Meloni has been named Italy’s first female prime minister at the head of a right-wing
                          government, after holding talks with the country’s president. After a week of infighting which
                          overshadowed the negotiations, Meloni’s warring coalition put forward a united front, backing
                          Meloni to lead the country during formal talks with President Sergio Mattarella, on Friday. Later
                          on Friday Mattarella asked Meloni to form a government. Meloni, after arriving for talks in a Fiat
                          500, accepted unconditionally, a spokesman for the president’s office said. The right-wing
                          coalition emerged triumphant from the election, with 44 percent of the vote, led by Meloni’s
                          Brothers of Italy party, which took 26 percent. But even before a government could be cobbled
                          together, rivalry emerged inside the coalition, with allies arguing over Meloni’s unwillingness to
                          accommodate Silvio Berlusconi’s preferred nominations in her cabinet. At the opening of the new
                          parliament, Berlusconi, leader of the Forza Italia party, said in a note left in public view that
                          he found Meloni “overbearing … domineering … arrogant … offensive.

                          announced that they’d boycott the HFPA until there was more meaningful change. On May 10, NBC
                          released a statement saying it would not be airing the 2022 Golden Globes. “We continue to believe
                          that the HFPA is committed to meaningful reform,” it read. “However, change of this magnitude takes
                          time and work, and we feel strongly that the HFPA needs time to do it right. Assuming the
                          organization executes on its plan, we are hopeful we will be in a position to air the show in
                          January 2023.” Yes, but not in the usual format. On January 4, 2022, Variety reported that the HFPA
                          had failed to secure any celebrity presenters for the upcoming ceremony. Hours later, the outlet
                          revealed that the 2022 Golden Globes would be “very stripped down [and] will center on announcing
                          this year’s winners while also focusing on the HFPA’s philanthropy work. There will not be an
                          audience, only select HFPA members and philanthropy grantees will be in the room. There will be no
                          red carpet and media credential requests for the event will not be accepted.

                          Planning and producing the Golden Globes ceremony annually will remain a focus, too. Earlier this
                          year, the HFPA disclosed that the voting body for the 2024 competition will be comprised of 310
                          journalists from outside the US, a group which will include the organization’s 95 current members.
                          In a statement, Dick Clark Productions’s CEO Jay Penske said: “As stewards of the Golden Globe
                          Awards, our mission is to continue creating the most dynamic awards ceremony on live television
                          viewed across the world. We have a great team in place to grow this iconic brand and captivate new
                          and existing audiences to celebrate the very best in television and motion pictures.” The ceremony
                          is currently scheduled for January 7, though there is not yet a broadcast partner for the awards
                          show. It could feasibly end up on a major network or a streaming platform, as was the case for the
                          SAG Awards, which aired live on Netflix’s YouTube page earlier this year. On February 21, 2021, a
                          Los Angeles Times investigation accused the HFPA of “self-dealing” and highlighted potential
                          conflicts of interest. Among them was the fact that 30 HFPA members had been flown to France to
                          visit the set of Emily in Paris in 2019. Two years later, the series was nominated for two Golden
                          Globes, while more critically lauded shows like I May Destroy You were snubbed.

                          Here’s how it works Home / Features / Google Pixel Watch 2: the features we want from a smartwatch
                          successor The first Pixel Watch was a solid start - but there's room for improvement Android fans
                          had a lot to like about the Google Pixel Watch when it landed in October 2022: a minimal design,
                          slick Fitbit integration, and the best version of the firm’s Wear OS software to date. Google’s
                          first wearable effort wasn’t perfect, though. Battery life was a real downer, and the “one size
                          fits all” approach was off-kilter with the rest of the smartwatch world. That leaves plenty of
                          areas for a Pixel Watch 2 to improve upon. At the time of writing there’s still a fairly long wait
                          before a successor is set to turn up – but that doesn’t mean we can’t look to the future, or come
                          up with a laundry list of things we’d like to see make the cut by the time it does. Google hasn’t
                          said anything official about a second Pixel Watch. At the annual I/O event in May 2023, it quickly
                          breezed over WearOS to leave more time to focus on AI, coding and other upcoming hardware like the
                          Pixel Fold smartphone. The only info we have to go on right now is a single tweet from prolific
                          phone leaker EVleaks.

                          Shinzo Abe, the former prime minister of Japan and a serving member of the House of
                          Representatives, was assassinated on 8 July 2022 while speaking at a political event outside
                          Yamato-Saidaiji Station in Nara City, Nara Prefecture, Japan.[3][4][5] While delivering a campaign
                          speech for a Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) candidate, he was shot from behind at close range by a
                          man with an improvised firearm.[1] Abe was transported by a medical helicopter to Nara Medical
                          University Hospital in Kashihara, where he was pronounced dead.[6] Leaders from many nations
                          expressed shock and dismay at Abe's assassination,[7] which was the first of a former Japanese
                          prime minister since Saitō Makoto and Takahashi Korekiyo during the February 26 incident in
                          1936.[8] Prime Minister Kishida decided to hold a state funeral for Abe on 27 September.[9] The
                          suspect, 41-year-old Tetsuya Yamagami (Japanese: 山上 徹也), was arrested at the scene for attempted
                          murder; the charge was later upgraded to murder after Abe was pronounced dead. Yamagami told
                          investigators that he had shot Abe in relation to a grudge he held against the Unification Church
                          (UC), to which Abe and his family had political ties, over his mother's bankruptcy in 2002.

                          was widely shared online by conspiracy theorists as a proof of Abe's death by sniper rifle, instead
                          of Yamagami's homemade gun, from the roof of the nearby shopping mall Sanwa City Saidaiji. The

                          and that tent was used as a hideout by the sniper. The management company of Sanwa City Saidaiji

                          protesters opposed to the state-funded funeral of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe lined
                          the streets near parliament in Tokyo on Tuesday, as helicopters whizzed above and dignitaries from
                          all over the world paid their respects to the slain leader. U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, who
                          was among those who came Tokyo's famed Budokan arena on Tuesday, said she came out of respect for
                          the slain leader's legacy and that Abe was a great friend to the United States. Japan's government
                          said about 3,600 people from Japan and about 700 from overseas would come to the state funeral.
                          Abe's critics said he was a divisive, lackluster leader who trampled on Japan's democratic
                          principles. Local polls show that opposition to the state funeral was far greater than the support.
                          "Even though he's gone, he still somehow manages to obfuscate the truth," Kazuma, a man in his
                          seventies in attendance at a large protest, told ABC News. "How can we have a state funeral if the
                          taxpayers don't approve?" Mihoko Inagaki, a woman from Tokyo in her thirties, said, "There has to
                          be some debate over whether or not they should use taxpayer money for this. They can't just use it
                          without discussion or debate. It's a serious threat to our democracy.

                          27, 2022 for Shinzo Abe, the former prime minister who was assassinated in July, has split Japan.
                          (Kyodo News via AP) TOKYO (AP) — A rare state funeral for Shinzo Abe, the former prime minister who
                          was assassinated in July, has split Japan. The hawkish Abe was one of the nation’s most divisive
                          postwar leaders, but it is the ruling party’s cozy ties with the ultra-conservative Unification
                          Church that has fired up much of the opposition to the funeral. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is
                          battling a near-continuous political fallout from his handling of both the links to the church
                          among his party’s lawmakers and the state funeral he says Abe deserves. A look at some of the
                          reasons why the state funeral on Tuesday is causing so much anger: The tradition has roots in a
                          ceremony performed by the emperor to honor those who made exceptional contributions to the country.
                          The emperor before World War II was revered as a god, and public mourning for those honored with
                          state funerals was compulsory. Most state funerals were for members of the imperial family, but
                          political and military leaders were also honored, including Isoroku Yamamoto, who commanded Japan’s
                          Pearl Harbor attack and died in 1943. The state funeral law was scrapped after the war.

                          George R.R. Martin outlined the major events in House Targaryen's history, which means there's very
                          little direct character dialogue. People like Queen Alicent are quoted every now and then in
                          "testimony" from people at court, and this line is one of those times. As is revealed over the
                          course of episode six, Alicent has grown up and taken charge as queen — but few people seem to want
                          to openly discuss the growing evidence that Rhaenyra is having children with a man who is not her
                          husband. "Do keep trying, Ser Laenor," Alicent says to Rhaenyra's husband. "Sooner or late you
                          might get one that looks like you." Virtually everyone else at court besides Ser Criston Cole and
                          Queen Alicent seem content to feign ignorance about this flouncing of societal duties and customs.
                          By including this line in the episode, the "House of the Dragon" writers are emphasizing how
                          Alicent's direct barbs helped lead to Ser Harwin and Lyonel Strong's deaths in the final minutes of
                          the episode. Back in episode five, little Prince Aegon Targaryen II was a toddler. Now Aegon is a
                          teenager around 14 years old, the same age his mother Alicent and his half-sister Rhaenyra were in
                          the pilot episode. He's played by Ty Tennant (son of "Doctor Who" actor David Tennant).

                          Nicola took to Insta to post a cute Polaroid selfie with co-star Louisa Harland, who plays Orla
                          McCool on the show. She placed two rainbow pin badges next to the sweet pic, in what appears to be
                          a heartfelt reference to lesbian character Claire. The actress went on to add the caption, "Goodbye
                          Derry Girls, it’s been quite a ride 🌈," seeming to confirm that filming has indeed finished. We're
                          not crying, you're crying. Filming for Derry Girls season 3 was originally supposed to start in
                          June 2020, but was delayed due to the pandemic. However, on 1 November 2021, Nicola shared another
                          Instagram post featuring a behind-the-scenes snap from set, appearing to make the start of
                          production. Posting a very close-up selfie complete with her character Claire's signature fringe
                          and scrunchie pigtails, Nicola wrote, "Guess who’s back in the house #ReturnOfTheWeeLesbian" - in
                          reference to the season 1 episode which saw Claire come out as a lesbian. While it wasn't 100%
                          clear whether filming had properly started, Nicola certainly seemed to be in costume (hey, maybe
                          she just likes to dress up at home to get into character). While Nicola Coughlan has confirmed that
                          she's returning as Claire, the rest of the main cast will remain the same too.

                          The remainder of the company would form a so-called "New Fox", maintaining control of assets such
                          as Fox's television network and broadcast stations (which Disney, already owning ABC, would be
                          legally unable to own due to an FCC policy known as the "dual network rule", which prohibits
                          mergers between the top broadcast networks), Fox News, the national operations of Fox Sports, and
                          the 20th Century Fox studio lot, which would be leased to Disney for seven years. Fox's regional
                          sports networks were also included in the sale, but were later divested by order of the Department
                          of Justice, on the grounds that the Fox regional networks' combination with Disney's 80% ownership
                          of ESPN would make Disney too dominant in the cable sports market.[14][15][16][17][18] In May 2018
                          it was confirmed that Lachlan Murdoch, rather than James Murdoch, would take charge of the New Fox
                          company.[3] In mid-2018 NBCUniversal's parent company Comcast instigated bidding wars over both the
                          Fox assets Disney planned to purchase, and the British broadcaster Sky plc (a company which 21st
                          Century Fox held a stake in, and was planning to acquire the remainder). In July 2018, Fox agreed
                          to an increase of Disney's offer to $71.3 billion to fend off Comcast's counter-bid.[19][20]
                          British regulators ordered that a blind auction be held for Sky's assets, which was won by

Question 181              : Who won the Japanese Grand Prix 2022?
Correct Answers         :  
                          Max Verstappen

  - Source              :
                          The 2022 Japanese Grand Prix (officially known as the Formula 1 Honda Japanese Grand Prix 2022) was
                          a Formula One motor race held on 9 October 2022 at the Suzuka International Racing Course in
                          Suzuka, Japan. Max Verstappen secured his second World Championship title after finishing first, in
                          front of Sergio Pérez and Charles Leclerc. Despite only 28 of the scheduled 53 laps being
                          completed, full points were awarded due to a loophole in the regulations regarding how points
                          should be allocated, with the rules stating that reduced points should only be awarded in shortened
                          races that end under red flag conditions. As this race ended under green flag conditions, this
                          system was not applied. The wording of the sporting regulations was subsequently amended for 2023,
                          so races that do not reach the 75 percent distance are awarded shortened race points regardless of
                          whether a race finishes under red or green flag conditions. The event was held across the weekend
                          of the 7–9 October. It was the eighteenth round of the 2022 Formula One World Championship and the
                          first time the event had been held since 2019, with the 2020 and 2021 races cancelled due to the
                          COVID-19 pandemic. Valtteri Bottas entered as the defending race winner.

                          national anthem.[12] The race started at 14:00 local time on 9 October 2022 under torrential rain
                          (which was the reason for so many incidents in the race) and was red-flagged on lap 2 after Ferrari
                          driver Carlos Sainz Jr. lost control into the hairpin of the opening lap and aquaplaned into the
                          barriers. A recovery vehicle was immediately dispatched, with several drivers passing the tractor
                          at speed under double-yellow flags on the second lap.[13] Alex Albon also retired due a collision
                          with Kevin Magnussen which caused damage to his radiator.[14] The race resumed at 16:15 local time
                          behind the safety car. Only twenty-eight laps were completed before the race was curtailed due to
                          it passing the three-hour time limit, with Verstappen taking his twelfth victory of the season.
                          Leclerc, who finished second on track, was given a five-second penalty for cutting the final
                          chicane whist defending from Pérez in third, which demoted him to third behind Pérez. The win meant
                          that Verstappen took the Championship title, leading Pérez by 113 points, with 112 points still
                          available.

                          wife.. and much more. Adrianna Tomaz, DC comics’ beloved superhero embodiment of the Egyptian

                          Dwayne Johnson-starring Black Adam. Ahead of the much-awaited film, here’s a look at Isis’

                          shaped the character, all in accordance with the original comic books’ lore. Initially known as

                          Black Adam, Ruler of Kahndaq, by the tech-savvy organized crime syndicate, Intergang. Lionhearted
                          in her courage, she waits until Adam has slain her captors before letting her outspoken personality
                          shine through. She confidently presents to him her steadfastly-held opinions on how he, a dictator,
                          should get to altering his various tyrannical ways in order to most effectively govern his own
                          homeland!

                          ends horrifically. Like, I don’t even want to describe it. Let’s just say that cannibalism is the
                          least triggering of the atrocities that ensue and leave it at that, okay? Isis had a relatively
                          small role in the 2011 New 52 reboot, but a new version of her returned to television in 2017, in
                          Seasons 3-7 of Legends of Tomorrow. Zari Tomaz (played by Tala Ashe) is a Muslim hacktivist from a
                          dystopian near-future, with no connection to the Shazam family; she does have a hereditary magic
                          amulet, but it gives her wind powers and not the other suite of powers her comics counterpart has.

Question 184              : What is the price of RTX 4090 GPU?
Correct Answers         :

                          Searching for an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 to buy? Don’t worry. We’ve got your covered, by searching
                          through the best loot spots for you to get this beast of a GPU. The RTX 4090, Nvidia’s shining
                          star, is certainly one of the best graphics cards on the market right now. With jaw-dropping
                          performance metrics, it’s no wonder it carries a steep price tag of $1599. Since its introduction
                          on October 12, 2022, the Nvidia RTX 4090 has been going off the shelf rapidly. While retailers have
                          finally managed to get plenty of these powerful GPUs on their shelves, the Founders Edition is
                          always snatched up like hotcakes. As the speediest GPU in the 40-series, the RTX 4090 is far beyond
                          the capabilities of every other commercially available gaming GPU. If the hype around the RTX 4090
                          is anything to go by, we might see the RTX 4090 Ti drop sooner as a surprise patch update. Looking
                          back at previous releases, the RTX 4080 hit the scene in November, with the RTX 4070 Ti hot on its
                          heels in early January 2023, and the standard RTX 4070 was the latest to join the party. Even the
                          4060 Ti also debuted just over a month ago.

                          It’s barely worth it to resell these cards right now, and with only 281 GPUs sold in 3 weeks, the
                          demand is scarce. The average sale price has also been gradually trending lower ever since launch.
                          Nvidia’s flagship RTX 4090 can be found at various online retailers, such as and , but the cards
                          priced near MSRP are all sold out. Meanwhile, or near it, and there are plenty of cards . Some
                          models are just $50 shy of hitting the recommended list price of the 4090 — by default, without any
                          scalper tax. It almost feels like people would just rather buy the RTX 4090 instead. Having looked
                          at the eBay sales numbers for both GPUs, I can tell you one thing — the RTX 4090 doesn’t seem to
                          have slowed down just because the RTX 4080 launched. On the contrary, it benefited from the
                          release. While the RTX 4080 appears to be selling at a snail’s pace and scalpers are desperate to
                          get rid of it, the 4090 thrives, and it’s still a catch at MSRP. Considering the vast chasm of
                          performance between the two, the 4090 remains a better deal if caught at the recommended price of
                          $1,600, however expensive that might be.

                          In short — the RTX 4080 seems to have done the 4090 a favor. It made an overpriced GPU suddenly
                          appear much more desirable than it ever should have been. Now, the question is, was this Nvidia’s
                          plan all along, or did it simply overestimate the enthusiasm people would have for the 4080?
                          Considering the fact that Nvidia is planning to strategically cut the MSRP of the RTX 4080 soon, it
                          might be that it never intended for the 4080 to serve as a crutch for the sales of the 4090. Nvidia
                          also has some serious competition on the horizon. AMD will soon be launching the next-gen Radeon RX
                          7900 XTX and 7900 XT, both of which are supposed to rival the RTX 4080, but at more reasonable
                          prices — $999 and $899, respectively. With the upcoming price cut, the RTX 4080 might become a more
                          worthwhile contender. For now, if you manage to spot the 4090 for $1,600, it is a better deal — but
                          only if you can make use of it. If you’re a casual gamer, save your money and get the 4080 without
                          worrying about benchmarks and comparisons. Personally, I’m still waiting for the 7900 XTX, and
                          judging by the performance per dollar of the RTX 4080, I really have no regrets.

                          Telling the true story of one of the NBA greats, 'Sweetwater' is just around the corner. Sports
                          biopics have a long illustrious history within cinema, and in recent years they have taken our
                          screens by storm. Some standout favorites include the likes of Craig Gillespie's I, Tonya starring
                          Margot Robbie, the recent Netflix biopic The Swimmers, and the highly-praised Ford v Ferrari. The
                          hunger for more sports biopics is great, and the eyes of the world constantly await the next
                          offering. Well, one such offering is just around the corner, in the form of Martin Guigui's
                          Sweetwater (2023). Telling the tale of Nat Clifton, an NBA Hall of Famer, the film itself has been
                          in the works since 2007 and is finally being released this year. Of course, we know that the movie
                          will be about the life of Nat Clifton, but a film cannot simply show every aspect of a person's
                          life, and will often choose a specific period of importance. The official plot synopsis of
                          Sweetwater reads: "The film follows Clifton, who is the star attraction of the Harlem
                          Globetrotters, led by owner/coach Abe Saperstein.

                          features a rounded design with a 3D glass dome. This raised effect distracts from the display's
                          thick bezel, but doesn't change the fact that a good chunk of the display is unusable. Perhaps my
                          prior experience with Samsung watches is to blame? I can't help but think it's a missed opportunity
                          to incorporate in digital rotating bezel in that space. It seems like no mistake that the Pixel
                          Watch is a "dark mode" device. The interface and all of Google's watch faces have black backgrounds
                          to further conceal the bezel.

                          Prospect Park Alliance and NYC Parks announced today that longtime… January 18, 2023 Morgan Monaco,
                          the new Prospect Park Alliance President and Park Administrator has a long history in the parks
                          world and a storied record of leadership in support of her community. Most recently, Monaco served
                          as Executive Director of the Red Hook Initiative, a youth and community development nonprofit
                          impacting the 6,500 residents of the Red Hook Houses, Brooklyn’s largest public housing
                          development. Earlier in her career, Monaco served two tenures at the New York City Department of
                          Parks and Recreation, first as Director of the MillionTreesNYC Initiative and later as Director of
                          Stewardship for Forestry, Horticulture and Natural Resources. Monaco began her career at
                          StoryCorps, a national oral history project designed to build connections between people and share
                          the stories of Americans from all backgrounds and beliefs. Monaco currently lives in Windsor
                          Terrace, Brooklyn and her family is an avid user of Prospect Park. As she begins the new role and
                          leads Brooklyn’s Backyard into its next chapter, we chatted with Monaco about her vision for the
                          future of the park, favorite spots and more. What are you most looking forward to as you begin your
                          role? I am most looking forward to learning more about everything the Prospect Park team, both NYC
                          Parks and Alliance staff, does to maintain and sustain Brooklyn’s Backyard.

                          February 4, 2022 A message from Prospect Park Alliance President Sue Donoghue: I am writing to you
                          today with exciting news: Mayor Eric Adams has announced my appointment as the next New York City
                          Parks Commissioner. Serving as the President of Prospect Park Alliance and Park Administrator has
                          been one of the great honors of my career. I’ve been so lucky to work alongside so many dedicated
                          people, from Alliance and NYC Parks staff, to our incredibly hardworking volunteers and community
                          advocates, and a devoted Board of Directors that has provided the Alliance exceptional guidance and
                          leadership. I’m honored to be taking on a citywide leadership role in caring for New York City’s
                          most essential resource, its parks and open spaces, and I will continue to cherish and support
                          Prospect Park as a neighbor and park advocate. It has been a great privilege to steward this
                          breathtakingly beautiful space, and serve as only the third president of this thriving,
                          35-years-young organization. During this time we’ve advanced the park in numerous ways: rebounding
                          from the challenges of the pandemic through our Re:New Prospect Park initiative; restoring the
                          Flatbush Avenue perimeter and creating the first new entrances of the park since the 1940s;
                          revitalizing and expanding the park’s woodlands and natural areas; bringing back to the public the
                          exquisitely restored Endale Arch and Concert Grove Pavilion; and securing funds for our next great
                          phase of restoration, the 26-acre Vale in the park’s northeast corner.

                          By Jess Weatherbed, a news writer focused on creative industries, computing, and internet culture.
                          Jess started her career at TechRadar, covering news and hardware reviews. Video game developer and
                          publisher Riot Games has announced its acquisition of Wargaming Sydney, a gaming software
                          development studio that’s part of Cyprus-based Wargaming, the publisher behind titles such as World
                          of Tanks and World of Warships. Riot did not disclose the price of the purchase. Wargaming Sydney
                          is one of the largest games studios in Australia, formed under its original name of BigWorld back
                          in 2002. It was by Wargaming in 2012. The studio has created game development tools and other
                          software architecture required to develop online games such as MMOs. After the acquisition by Riot,
                          Wargaming Sydney will be renamed Riot Sydney and will assist in the development of Riot games such
                          as Valorant and League of Legends. Wargaming will maintain ownership of BigWorld Technology
                          Wargaming Sydney is the only operation being acquired by Riot Games, with other studios under the
                          Wargaming name unaffected by the purchase. Wargaming will also maintain ownership of BigWorld
                          technology’s gaming software architecture for its existing products. Riot says the newly branded
                          Riot Sydney will be a key contributor to its network of development studios.

                          5][20] In March 2016, Riot Games acquired Radiant Entertainment, another developer who was working
                          on Rising Thunder and Stonehearth at the time.[21] Rising Thunder was effectively canceled
                          following the acquisition, with the game's team allocated to a new project.[22] On October 13,
                          2017, Beck and Merrill announced that they were returning their focus to developing games, aiming
                          to create new experiences for video game and esports players.[23] Beck and Merrill handed over the
                          day-to-day operations and overall management of the League of Legends team to three longtime
                          employees: Dylan Jadeja, Scott Gelb, and Nicolo Laurent, who previously served as chief financial
                          officer (CFO), chief technology officer (CTO) and president, respectively.[23] Subsequently, Gelb
                          and Laurent assumed roles as chief operating officer (COO) and chief executive officer (CEO),

                          Riot Games employed 2,500 people,[25] operating 24 offices around the world.[26] In October 2019,
                          Riot Games announced several new games: a version of League of Legends for mobile devices and
                          consoles called League of Legends: Wild Rift, a standalone mobile version of the Teamfight Tactics
                          mode from League of Legends, and the digital collectible card game titled Legends of Runeterra,
                          with all three scheduled for a 2020 release.

                          note 1] The company also teased further games — Project A, a tactical shooter; Project L, a
                          fighting game with League of Legends characters; and Project F, a multiplayer game set in Runeterra
                          – that were not detailed outside of genre descriptions and brief gameplay clips.[28][29] Project A
                          was later revealed to be Valorant, which entered closed beta on April 7, 2020[30] and was
                          officially released on June 2, 2020.[31] In December 2019, Riot Games announced Riot Forge, a
                          publishing label headed by Leanne Loombe. The label partners with smaller game development studios
                          for the creation of League of Legends games, with some games of this type already being in
                          development.[32] Two titles from Riot Forge were announced at The Game Awards 2019: Ruined King: A
                          League of Legends Story by Airship Syndicate, and Convergence: A League of Legends Story by Double
                          Stallion Games.[33] Another division, Riot Tabletop, was announced in January 2020, to producing
                          tabletop games; the first was Tellstones: King's Gambit, released in 2020.[34] Riot acquired
                          Hypixel Studios in April 2020, which they had been investing in over the previous eighteen months
                          to help them publish Hytale, a voxel-based sandbox game.[35] Also in April, Riot announced plans to
                          establish a Singapore office later that year.

                          Here's Gowrappan's memo to Yahoo staff: Team - We've entered a new chapter in our history, and I am
                          tremendously proud of all that we have accomplished together over the past three years. Like the
                          start of any next chapter, this is a natural moment for transition. I've made the decision to take
                          on a new role as a senior advisor to Apollo. This role will enable me to support our next phase of
                          growth and continued investment in the company. As such, I am excited to welcome Jim Lanzone as the
                          new CEO of Yahoo effective September 27, 2021. Jim is a veteran technology and media leader with
                          two decades of leadership experience and a deep track record of growth, innovation and an
                          entrepreneurial spirit. I have every confidence he will be a terrific leader for the new Yahoo. Jim
                          and I will work together to ensure a seamless transition, and I'm confident he will build on our
                          successes and lead us into our future. What an incredible journey this has been. I joined the
                          company three years ago as part of Verizon. Today, we're a standalone company with significant
                          potential to grow beyond what we have accomplished thus far. We have the best team, with the right
                          products, content and technology to shape the future of Yahoo. To reiterate what's been said many
                          times over the past few months – this next chapter is a testament to the great work you've
                          delivered against a focused strategy.

                          job. The position has been open since Bob Biesterfeld was let go at the beginning of the year.
                          During its most recent analyst call, Robinson said a decision would be made and announced by the

Question 191              : What is the subscriber growth of Netflix in Q3 2022?
Correct Answers         :  
                          2.41 million
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prediction (only positive):
  - Answer              : +4.5 percent
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :

                          Enterprise and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply. Netflix added 2.41 million
                          global subscribers in the third quarter of 2022, bringing its grand total to 223.09 million (73.39
                          million from the U.S. and Canada), a gain of +4.5 percent over the prior year’s comparable quarter.
                          Q3 was the first quarter of 2022 when Netflix didn’t lose subs. According to Tuesday’s shareholder
                          letter, executives at Netflix believe they’ll add 4.50 million subs globally in the final quarter
                          of 2022. The streamer added 4.38 million subs in the year-ago quarter, which at the time
                          represented 9.4 percent growth. So we’re not there — but we are well above the company’s tempered
                          expectations; at the end of Q2, Netflix forecasted that it would add 1 million global subscribers
                          in Q3. Clearly, it bested that — the same goes for its financial forecasts. Netflix earned $3.10
                          per share in the third quarter on $7.926 billion in revenue; its net income was $1.398 billion.
                          Wall Street forecasted earnings of $2.13 per share on $7.84 billion in revenue. Back on July 19,
                          Netflix itself estimated Q3 earnings per share of $2.

                          to stay. “We don’t make these decisions lightly, and we realize how hard this may be for our
                          members,” YouTube spokesperson Marni Greenberg said in a statement. “This new price reflects the
                          complete value of YouTube Premium and will allow us to develop even more Premium features and
                          continue to support the creators and artists our members watch and listen to on YouTube.” The cost
                          of an individual YouTube Premium plan remains unchanged at $11.99 per month. YouTube doesn’t have
                          anything to share today about changes to other plans, Greenberg said, but noted that the company
                          will notify users by email at least 30 days in advance before changing the price. Update October

                          Batwheels, announcing today the DC Super-Villain voice cast lineup. Gina Rodriguez (Jane the

                          SquarePants) as Crash lead the talented cast voicing some of Batman’s most iconic adversaries in
                          the upcoming preschool action-adventure animated comedy. The villains will go bumper-to-bumper
                          against the heroes of Batwheels voiced by the previously-announced cast led by Ethan Hawke (as
                          Batman), Jacob Bertrand (as Bam the Batmobile), and AJ Hudson (as Duke Thomas/Robin). Produced by
                          Warner Bros. Animation, the series will race onto Cartoonito on HBO Max and Cartoon Network this
                          fall. The evil counterpart to the heroic Batwheels, the Legion of Zoom is a team of sentient
                          vehicles brought to computerized life by Badcomputer, the new ultimate computer of the DC Universe.
                          They, like the Batwheels, are essentially kids with little to no life experience. However, unlike
                          the Batwheels, “The Zooms” are under Badcomputer’s malevolent guidance and often don’t make the
                          best decisions.

                          at someone’s expense than carrying out a plan. Alexandra Novelle as Jetstah – Harley Quinn’s

                          minister on 25 October 2022, after accepting King Charles III's invitation to form a
                          government.[114] He is both the first British Asian and the first Hindu prime minister of the
                          United Kingdom. In his first speech as prime minister, Sunak promised "integrity, professionalism
                          and accountability," and said that "we will create a future worthy of the sacrifices so many have
                          made and fill tomorrow, and everyday thereafter with hope."[115] Of his predecessor, Sunak said
                          that Truss "was not wrong" to want to improve growth, but admitted that "some mistakes were made",
                          and that he was elected prime minister in part to fix them. He promised to "place economic
                          stability and confidence at the heart of this government's agenda".[116] Sunak began to appoint his
                          cabinet on 25 October 2022.

                          the Conservative Party and prime minster of the United Kingdom in October 2022. Previously he
                          served as chancellor of the Exchequer (2020–22). Sunak was born into a family with immigrant roots.
                          His grandparents emigrated from Punjab, in northwestern India, to East Africa, where his mother and
                          father were born in Tanzania and Kenya, respectively. They met and married after their families

                          fund his education, Sunak was able to attend Winchester College, the exclusive private school that
                          has produced no fewer than six chancellors of the Exchequer.

                          In the photos, taken at Dunsfold Aerodrome, Elizabeth Debicki’s Diana sports the late royal’s
                          iconic coif, as well as a floral midi dress. On November 5, 2021, Debicki was photographed wearing
                          a recreation of Princess Diana’s famous “revenge dress,” which she wore to the 1994 Vanity Fair
                          dinner at the Serpentine Gallery in London. That evening coincided with the airing of a documentary
                          featuring an interview that Prince Charles had with Jonathan Dimbleby, in which he admitted to
                          being unfaithful to Diana with Camilla Parker. Diana had bought the dress in 1991, but didn’t dare
                          to wear it at the time—an off-the-shoulder dress is against Royal protocol. The dress was perceived
                          by some as a form of vengeance against Prince Charles and his family. Finally, mere weeks before

                          Seasons Resort Maui at Wailea. While the singular setting appears pretty purposeful when watching –
                          The White Lotus has been likened to an upper-class, American version of the British TV series,
                          Benidorm – the use of one primary setting is rooted in 2020’s Covid restrictions. Filmed from
                          October to December 2020, season one’s cast and crew were completely isolated during filming, with
                          a singular location used in order to avoid any cross contamination. Season 2 of The White Lotus was

                          filmed entirely in the hotel and its nearby beach. In season 2, spot the likes of Taormina, Noto,
                          Palermo, Cefalù, and this very beautiful villa.

                          While The White Lotus was originally intended to be a standalone miniseries, the overwhelmingly
                          positive reception and acclaim inspired White to utilize the anthology format to create another

                          While The White Lotus was originally intended to be a standalone miniseries, the overwhelmingly
                          positive reception and acclaim inspired White to utilize the anthology format to create another
                          installment. Amidst the buzz around Season 2, HBO confirmed that the series had been renewed for

                          election for Senate. Some states and some individual counties provide results broken down by type

                          Senate; with Kelly's victory in Arizona and a Democratic victory in Nevada, it was projected on
                          November 12 that the Democratic caucus would retain control of the Senate in the 118th United
                          States Congress.[6][7] Initially expected to be one of the most widely contested elections in the
                          nation, Kelly amassed a massive fundraising advantage over Masters, raising a record $75 million
                          dollars, compared to Masters's $12 million.[67] Due to the Supreme Court's ruling to overturn Roe
                          Vs. Wade, which gave states the right to ban abortion, Kelly spent heavily attacking Masters over
                          his anti abortion stance, which was seen as hurting Masters especially among women voters. He also
                          attacked Masters's support for privatizing social security, as Arizona has many retired seniors
                          whom use the program. Masters's belief that the 2020 presidential election was stolen also hurt him
                          among voters.[68] With the limited amount of money he had, Masters attempted to portray Kelly as
                          weak on illegal immigration, supportive of spending programs that caused inflation, and too
                          supportive of President Joe Biden. In the final weeks of the campaign, Republican groups began to
                          increase the amount of money they were spending on the race, and many news outlets moved the race
                          from Lean Democrat to tossup. However, in the end Kelly relatively easily defeated Masters, which
                          helped to allow Democrats to retain the Senate.[69] W Withdrawn Kelly won 5 out of 9 congressional
                          districts, including two that elected Republicans.[126]

  - Source              :
                          This projection was based on a variety of metrics, including generic ballot testing that favored a
                          Republican-led Congress as well as President Biden’s low approval rating, which hovers around 40%.
                          Super PACS and political party groups were spending money almost exclusively in districts that
                          President Biden won in 2020, indicating that Democrats were in a defensive crouch. Midterm
                          elections often benefit the opposition political party at the expense of the White House’s party.
                          1994 and 2010 were typical midterm elections, where Republicans made gains in the House at the
                          midpoint of Bill Clinton and Barack Obama’s first terms. Similarly, in 2018, Republican’s got
                          crushed in House elections but picked up two seats in the Senate. If a president’s approval ratings
                          are high, then the presiding party typically fares better in midterm House elections. For example,
                          in 1998, Bill Clinton’s approval rating was 66%, and Democrats retained control of the House. In
                          2002, George W. Bush polled at a 63%, and Republicans made gains. Currently, Biden’s approval
                          rating is 42%, which is similar to former president Barack Obama’s rating in 2010. That year,
                          Democrats lost control of the House, similar to what occurred during this year’s midterms. After
                          each census, congressional district lines are redrawn. This Nov. 8 election was the first general
                          election since the redistricting process concluded.

Question 203              : Who won the U.S. Senate race in Nevada in the 2022 midterm elections?
Correct Answers         :  
                          Catherine Cortez Masto
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prediction (only positive):

                          NevadaToday Nevada Election Survey Project poll finds 52% of Nevadans plan to vote for Cortez Masto
                          As Nevadans begin voting in the 2022 midterm election, a new University of Nevada, Reno poll of
                          likely voters released today finds Catherine Cortez Masto leading in the race for U.S. senator and
                          Steve Sisolak leading in the governor’s race. The governor’s race is within the margin of error,
                          but the senate race is not. The Nevada Election Survey Project 2022 general election poll, which
                          asked nearly 600 likely Nevada voters about their voting intentions and views on state and national
                          officials, found 52% of Nevadans plan to vote for Cortez Masto, 39% for Adam Laxalt and 5% remain
                          undecided. Cortez Masto’s large lead reflects less Republican voter enthusiasm for Laxalt’s
                          candidacy compared to Joe Lombardo and other Republican candidates. Among likely Republican voters,
                          74% said they planned to support Laxalt, compared to 83% for Lombardo and 88% for their Republican
                          House of Representatives candidate. More Republicans also plan to support Cortez Masto than other
                          Democrats on the ballot. Even if this sample of Nevadans is unusually supportive of the incumbent
                          senator, lower support among any likely Republican voters for Laxalt, in what others have polled as
                          a very tight race, is noteworthy.

                          "Lullaby" is a song by English rock band the Cure from their eighth studio album, Disintegration
                          (1989). Released as a single on 10 April 1989, the song is the band's highest-charting single in
                          their home country, reaching number five on the UK Singles Chart. It additionally reached number
                          three in West Germany and Ireland while becoming a top-10 hit in several other European countries
                          and New Zealand. The music video, directed by Tim Pope, won the British Video of the Year at the
                          1990 Brit Awards. The meaning of "Lullaby" has been speculated by fans, including as a metonymy for
                          addiction, depression, or sexual assault,[2] and Smith has offered multiple explanations as to its
                          theme or content, such as childhood nightmares or abuse.[2] One explanation by Smith follows that
                          the song is about the disturbing songs his father sung to him as a kid, and the horrible ending
                          they would always have.[3] Tim Pope, a long-time collaborator of the Cure on many of its music
                          videos, interprets "Lullaby" as an allegory for lead singer Robert Smith's drug-addled past.[4]
                          Upon its release, "Lullaby" became the Cure's highest-charting hit in their home country when it
                          reached number five on the UK Singles Chart. It remains their only single to reach the top five in
                          the United Kingdom.

                          Millie Gibson is set to star as the new companion on Doctor Who, but is she qualified and what does
                          her casting indicate about the new series? 2023 marks the 60th Anniversary of Doctor Who, and it is
                          expected to be a big celebration for the popular British television series. Not only is fan
                          favorite David Tennant returning to the franchise for a series of specials, but Ncuti Gatwa has
                          been cast as the Fifteenth Doctor, the first black actor to play the iconic hero. While little is
                          known about the new Doctor, the BBC did announce that Millie Gibson has been cast as Ruby Sunday,
                          the Doctor's new companion. Much attention has been paid to Tennant's return and Gatwa's casting,
                          but Gibson is an exciting choice for the franchise. The companion is just as important for Doctor
                          Who as the Doctor himself, so the person cast in the role takes on a big responsibility. At just 18
                          years old, she will be the youngest person to be cast as a companion and was only a one-year-old
                          when the series was revived in 2005. Is the young star ready for such a major role? Her casting
                          might be the key to understanding the new direction for the series. The Doctor's companion is an
                          important role in the series, but this is a performance on a television series. This is not the
                          same as an actual medical doctor or a firefighter where one does expect years of training and a
                          certain level of experience to be considered qualified.

                          but has an ethereal quality that creates something grand and a sense of importance in that moment.
                          For the rehearsal dinner, she’ll swap out the cape for the jacket, which is a more tailored,

                          After Argentina shockingly fell to Saudi Arabia 2-1 in their Group C opener in what goes down as
                          the biggest World Cup upset in history, they bounced back with consecutive 2-0 wins to claim top
                          spot in Group C. Poland also managed to squeeze into the knockout stages on goal difference with a
                          single goal keeping Mexico stuck in third spot. Despite stunning Argentina in their opening game,
                          Saudi Arabia ended up finishing bottom of the group after two straight losses. Argentina will now
                          face Australia in the Round of 16, while Poland will try to end France's title defence. WORLD CUP

                          one of the game’s greatest-ever players. Lionel Messi is now 35, and Qatar will be the last chance
                          for him to add the World Cup trophy to his already bulging cabinet and cap off a remarkable career,
                          after he confirmed it will be his last appearance at the tournament.

                          will be heading in a new direction. "The series never stopped evolving during its run, and we are

                          Paramount+," said Nicole Clemens, Paramount+'s President of Original Scripted Series. "Erica

                          text-to-speech feature has spoken — and she’s a Canadian local radio host. Kat Callaghan hosts The
                          Beat on 91.5 FM in Ontario. She also made a major reveal this month: She’s the voice of TikTok’s
                          text-to-speech feature. Iconic! Callaghan confessed in her very first TikTok video. For a long time
                          I didn’t say a word. But … yes it’s me and yes I have an ongoing awesome relationship with the

                          are putting out there using my voice. (Also oddly enough this is my first TikTok) “When you guys
                          have been asking me if I’m the voice on TikTok,” the text-to-speech caption said. “Finally I can
                          tell you guys: It is me,” Callaghan said in her authentic voice. In the caption, she explained that
                          she has an awesome ongoing relationship with TikTok. “The coolest part for me is watching the
                          creativity & awesome content that people are putting out there using my voice,” Callaghan wrote.
                          The video received over 29.4 million views. Some were in shock, but not everyone believed she was
                          the voice they had heard for so long.

                          Lautaro Martinez REUTERS/Hannah Mckay Dec 18 (Reuters) - Argentina won their third World Cup trophy
                          after the final in Qatar on Sunday. Here is what you need to know about their route to the title: *
                          The top two in each World Cup group advance to the last 16. The knockout rounds, which began on
                          Dec. 3, feature one-off matches, which can go to extra time and penalties to decide the winners. *
                          Argentina recovered from their shock defeat to Saudi Arabia with back-to-back wins over Mexico and
                          Poland to finish as winners of Group C. * Lionel Messi and Julian Alvarez scored in Argentina's 2-1
                          win over Australia in their Round of 16 tie. * Argentina beat the Netherlands 4-3 in a penalty
                          shootout in their quarter-final tie, after Nahuel Molina and Messi's goals were cancelled out by a
                          brace from Dutch substitute Wout Weghorst. * Argentina beat Croatia 3-0 in the semi-finals, with
                          Messi coolly putting away a spot kick in the 34th minute to open the scoring before Alvarez found
                          the net either side of halftime.

                          Brazil defeated Spain 1-0 in the first round of the group stage, but both teams progressed to the
                          round of 16, and both were eliminated in a penalty shootout in the quarter-finals that year. After
                          performing below expectations in the last two World Cups, Spain will be keen to eliminate Brazil,
                          but we’re mapping the route of the five-time world champions here, and Tite’s men will progress to
                          the semi-final stage, where they’ll face… The supercomputer projects another South American rival
                          will stand in the way of Brazil’s route to glory. According to the numbers, Brazil will face their
                          neighbours Argentina in the semi-finals. In Group C, Argentina have the highest chance of any side
                          to progress from the group stages (90.2%) according to our model. It’ll be a relief for them, as
                          the runners-up in that group likely face current champions France in the last 16. By topping their
                          group, Argentina would then face Denmark, the predicted runners-up in Group D. In the
                          quarter-finals, their battle would be against the Netherlands from Group A, who would have
                          eliminated the USA in the first round of the knockouts. USA are projected to finish second in Group
                          B, ahead of Wales and Iran. Argentina arrive at the World Cup on the back of a 35-game unbeaten run
                          (W24 D11), the longest in their history.

                          The 2014 World Cup winners have many young players in their squad. Hansi Flick’s arrival is
                          definitely an upgrade but the players are taking time to adapt to his style of play. Nonetheless,
                          it will be an interesting match because Germany have players like Sane, Gnabry, Muller and even
                          Gotze with them. Besides Argentina, Brazil are the most favoured candidates to win the 2022 FIFA
                          World Cup. It would not be surprising to see Brazil defeat Argentina as well. Brazil lost to
                          Argentina in the Copa America final and ever since then, they are unbeaten in 15 matches. Brazil
                          have failed to make it past three Quarter-Finals over the past four World Cups. Neymar, Brazil’s
                          star player is key for all of their fixtures. The PSG superstar is in great form and is arguably
                          the most essential player for Brazil in the 2022 FIFA World Cup. If Argentina do face Brazil in the
                          Semi-finals, surely Neymar and Messi will play a prominent role to win the match for their home
                          nation. This will surely be one of the best matches in the 2022 FIFA World Cup if it happens. For

                          It's quite possibly the most anticipated film of the year so far. Greta Gerwig's Barbie, starring
                          Margot Robbie as the eponymous doll and Ryan Gosling as Ken, finally arrives in theaters on July
                          21, 2023, after spending the better part of a decade in development. Gerwig's involvement was first
                          announced in 2019, marking the 60th anniversary of Barbie herself. Though Amy Schumer was
                          originally attached to develop Mattel's signature feature, the comedian left the project when it
                          was clear that executives at Mattel didn't see eye-to-eye with her feminist vision. "They
                          definitely didn't want to do it the way I wanted to do it, the only way I was interested in doing
                          it," she told Andy Cohen on an episode of Watch What Happens Live. Something must have changed
                          along the way because nearly everyone involved with the production of Barbie seems to agree that
                          Gerwig's interpretation of the iconic character is both feminist and funny. As we bide our time
                          until opening night, EW has compiled everything you need to know about the cast of Barbie.

  - Source              :
                          Barbie had originally been in the works in 2015 with Oscar-winning Juno screenwriter Diablo Cody
                          before it moved to Amy Schumer in 2016 who was set to star and co-write. She dropped out in 2017
                          and later said: “They definitely didn’t want to do it the way I wanted to do it, the only way I was
                          interested in doing it.” It was then set to star Anne Hathaway before it finally went to Robbie,
                          who asked Gerwig to get involved. The film is set to be followed by another Mattel adaptation, a
                          take on Polly Pocket written and directed by Lena Dunham and starring Lily Collins. Dunham
                          confirmed in October she is still working on the script. Other Mattel films in development include
                          Masters of the Universe and Hot Wheels. Gerwig made her directorial debut with Lady Bird, which
                          earned five Oscar nominations before she brought a new adaptation of Little Women in 2019, which
                          garnered six Oscar nods. Robbie’s latest film, Babylon, co-starring Brad Pitt, hits cinemas this
                          month and she will be next seen in Wes Anderson’s Asteroid City alongside Tom Hanks, Scarlett
                          Johansson and Tilda Swinton. Barbie is set to land in cinemas in July 2023.

                          Tyler Adams will captain the US men’s national team into the 2022 FIFA World Cup, head coach Gregg
                          Berhalter announced on the eve of Monday’s Group B opener vs. Wales (2 pm ET | FOX, Telemundo). The
                          Leeds United midfielder and New York Red Bulls homegrown product will be the USMNT’s youngest
                          captain since Walter Bahr at the 1950 World Cup. He’s already worn the armband nine times during 32
                          career international appearances. “We think he has great leadership capabilities,” Berhalter said
                          of the 23-year-old Wappingers Falls, New York native. “He leads by his actions and his words.” FIFA
                          requires teams to name a singular captain for the tournament; the USMNT were the last of 32
                          Qatar-qualified squads to complete that task. During Berhalter’s tenure, the USMNT have relied on a
                          leadership council and rotating armband responsibilities. Chelsea forward Christian Pulisic and
                          Nashville SC center back Walker Zimmerman were other leading candidates to be named captain. “A lot
                          of credit to my teammates,” Adams said, “because anyone throughout our leadership council can wear
                          that armband and represent us with pride and represent us in the right way." Adams debuted for the
                          Red Bulls in 2016 before moving to Europe in the winter of 2019, then to German Bundesliga side RB

                          workers and food processors. By Peter Baker WASHINGTON — President Biden announced Thursday that he
                          was investing $36 billion in federal funds to save the pensions of more than 350,000 union workers
                          and retirees, a demonstration of commitment to labor just a week after a rupture over an imposed
                          settlement of a threatened rail strike. Mr. Biden gathered top union leaders at the White House to
                          make the commitment, described by the White House as the largest ever award of federal financial
                          support for worker and retiree pension security. The money, coming from last year’s Covid-19 relief

                          they’ve provided for their families and their future, and it’s secure,” Mr. Biden said, joined by

                          NCAAF 47 USC quarterback Caleb Williams won the 2022 Maxwell Award on Thursday, given to the best
                          player in college football. Here’s what you need to know: Williams was the best quarterback in
                          America this season, so the Maxwell Award was deserved. Williams led USC’s turnaround from a
                          four-win team to a top-10 squad in 2022 and elevated the players around him. Now his sights turn to
                          Saturday night and the Heisman Trophy. — Morales Duggan’s story has been one of the best in college
                          football, starting TCU’s season as the backup quarterback before leading the Horned Frogs to a 12-0
                          start. His toughness and perseverance helped pull the Frogs out of multiple second-half deficits
                          and without his poise, leadership and production late in games, TCU wouldn’t be in the College
                          Football Playoff. Winning the O’Brien and being a Heisman finalist are both well-deserved honors

                          America this season, so the Maxwell Award was deserved. Williams led USC’s turnaround from a
                          four-win team to a top-10 squad in 2022 and elevated the players around him. Now his sights turn to
                          Saturday night and the Heisman Trophy. — Morales Duggan’s story has been one of the best in college
                          football, starting TCU’s season as the backup quarterback before leading the Horned Frogs to a 12-0
                          start. His toughness and perseverance helped pull the Frogs out of multiple second-half deficits
                          and without his poise, leadership and production late in games, TCU wouldn’t be in the College
                          Football Playoff. Winning the O’Brien and being a Heisman finalist are both well-deserved honors
                          for Duggan. — Khan Chuck Bednarik Award – Defensive Player of the Year Biletnikoff Award –

                          RAYYAN, Qatar, Dec 6 (Reuters) - Morocco rode a wave of passionate support and kept the World Cup
                          dreams of the Arab world alive as they eliminated fancied Spain in a penalty shootout on Tuesday to
                          reach the quarter-finals. In doing so, they became the first Arab nation to advance to the last
                          eight, ensuring a breakthrough for the region in the first global tournament in the Middle East,
                          and also became the fourth African side to go this far in World Cup history. Their victory will be
                          seen as not only a triumph for Morocco but vindication of the controversial FIFA decision to hand
                          Qatar the hosting rights, adding significant gloss to another Arab success at the tournament like
                          Saudi Arabia beating Argentina and Tunisia upsetting holders France in the group phase. Morocco,
                          who edged Spain 3-0 in the shootout after a 0-0 draw at the end of two hours of energy-sapping
                          action, now have a chance to become both the Arab world and Africa's first-ever semi-finalists if
                          they continue to use the overwhelming support that has backed them through an impressive array of
                          results.

                          In 2010, Ghana were the only one of six representatives to advance from the group stage in South
                          Africa. The Black Stars, combining the experience of their debut in 2006 with the promise of their
                          2009 under-20 World Cup winning team, played organised, disciplined football and, after wins over
                          Serbia and the USA, came within a handball of a place in the semi-finals. So, has all that promise
                          and hope disappeared? The inability of African teams to cross this rubicon is connected to the
                          continent’s economic disadvantages relative to Europe and South America. According to the World
                          Population Review, going by gross national income per capita (as of 2020), nine of the 10 poorest
                          countries in the world are in Africa. This creates a snowball effect that affects the continent’s
                          potential, restricting development, enabling corruption and impeding professionalism. Africa’s
                          World Cup outings have been littered with scandal, mostly about unpaid wages, that has led to
                          opprobrium and derailed focus. “The politics is too closely involved in the football,” former DR
                          Congo international Gabriel Zakuani told Al Jazeera. “With African countries, it plays such a big
                          part, especially for the local players who depend on those bonuses. If that doesn’t happen, the
                          focus shifts away from football. So that’s something that should be taken care of before you get to
                          the World Cup or a major tournament.

                          grinding poverty in rural Kenya. "I never forgot what it was like with my stomach churning because
                          of hunger at night," even though her mother "worked really hard to educate us," she said on CNN
                          Sunday. Online voters selected Cheboi as the top winner from a field of 10 heroes. On a full
                          scholarship at Augustana College in Illinois, she "fell in love" with computer science and knew she
                          had found her career path. It wasn't until she began working in the software industry, however,
                          that she realized that companies just throw away computers when it's time for an update. She said
                          she knew there were children in Kenya who had no idea what a computer was and so TechLit Africa was
                          born. TechLit Africa currently serves 10 schools and Cheboi hopes to be in 100 more within a year.
                          Her students attend daily classes in a variety of computer skills, including coding, and they also
                          have the opportunity to engage in remote learning. "They can go from doing a remote class with NASA
                          on education to music production," Cheboi said.

  - Source              :
                          13, 2022): Adam Sandler is set to receive the 2023 Mark Twain Prize for American Humor on March 19,
                          2023 in the Kennedy Center Concert Hall in Washington, D.C. Sandler, who was a cast member of NBC’s
                          Saturday Night Live from 1991 to 1995, is the seventh former cast member of that long-running show
                          to receive the honor, a sign of its profound influence on American comedy. He follows Billy
                          Crystal, Tina Fey, Will Ferrell, Eddie Murphy, Bill Murray and Julia Louis-Dreyfus. In addition,
                          Lorne Michaels, who created the show, received the honor in 2004. “Adam Sandler has entertained
                          audiences for over three decades with his films, music, and his tenure as a fan favorite cast
                          member on SNL,” Kennedy Center President Deborah F. Rutter said in a statement. “Adam has created
                          characters that have made us laugh, cry, and cry from laughing. I am looking forward to a
                          laughter-filled evening like no other as we celebrate his career at a ceremony that is sure to
                          bring together the best in comedy.” Over the past 30 years, Sandler has enjoyed success as a
                          comedian, actor, writer, producer, and musician. His films, including Grown Ups, Big Daddy, The
                          Longest Yard and The Waterboy, have grossed more than $3 billion worldwide.

                          Charlie Baker assumed the duties as the NCAA's sixth president on March 1, 2023. He was hired for
                          the position on Dec. 15, 2022, as he neared the conclusion of his term as the 72nd governor of
                          Massachusetts. A former collegiate athlete at Harvard, Baker is credited with bringing bipartisan
                          leadership to the state, successfully guiding Massachusetts through an exceptionally turbulent
                          period for government officials. In addition to his two terms as governor, he has brought decades
                          of experience spearheading transformations at high-profile institutions in the private and public
                          sectors. Baker has arrived at the NCAA at a moment of significant transformation. Legal shifts in
                          the environment surrounding college sports have challenged the NCAA's ability to serve as an
                          effective national regulator for college athletics, resulting in an untenable patchwork of
                          individual state laws. Partnering with federal policymakers to develop a consistent, sustainable
                          legal framework to address issues common to student-athletes and athletic departments across the
                          country is a top and immediate priority. A Republican governor serving a predominantly Democratic
                          state, Baker was re-elected to a second term in 2018 with 67 percent of the vote. After eight years
                          in office, he achieved approval ratings exceeding 75 percent, making him the highest-rated governor
                          in the United States and one of the highest-rated elected representatives in the nation. Baker
                          earned widespread support by taking on issues with significant real-world impacts, and approaching
                          them in substantive, innovative and bipartisan ways.

                          Mechelle Voepel: It took public embarrassment during the 2021 NCAA basketball tournaments for
                          Emmert to show interest in the women's event. The inequities between the men and women were obvious
                          and stark, which put the NCAA into damage-control mode. At that point, those in the women's
                          basketball world had to question if Emmert was very sincere in his concern, but there was a
                          "better-late-than-never" sentiment. And the NCAA's decision to commission the so-called Kaplan
                          report, which did a deep dive into inequities in all men's and women's NCAA championships, was an
                          important step because it didn't pull any punches about how significant those issues have been. The
                          report also said the NCAA has been selling women's sports short regarding potential television
                          revenue. When it's time to negotiate TV rights again, rather than selling multiple championships in
                          a bargain bundle, the NCAA needs to think bigger about the worth of each championship and how best
                          to maximize revenue from it. Also, the NCAA has to show more leadership regarding the inclusion of
                          transgender athletes in competition. As with so many things, the NCAA has been behind on this. Dave

                          controversial and unpredictable in the role since he bought the company for $44bn last October.
                          Musk indicated that he will still play a prominent role at Twitter, tweeting that Yaccarino will
                          focus on business operations while he will concentrate on product design and new technology. Before

                          company.[70] On October 4, 2022, it was reported that Musk offered to proceed with the deal at the
                          original offer price of $54.20 per share.[71][72] The deal closed on October 27, 2022, with the
                          merger between Twitter, Inc. and X Holdings II, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of X Holdings I,
                          Inc., wholly owned by Musk,[73] and Musk took control of the company,[74] paying $54.20 per share,
                          or about $44 billion.[75] By January 2023, Twitter only had around 2,300 employees left, according
                          to Musk, with only 550 working full-time.[76][77][78][79] By April, there were less than 1,500
                          active employees left[80] with 80% of Twitter's work force gone in a year.[81] On October 28,

                          Twitter's stock was suspended from trading prior to the New York Stock Exchange opening the next
                          day and was delisted on November 8.[83][84] On October 31, Musk announced in a security filing that
                          he had dissolved the board of directors and would serve as the CEO of the company.

                          and became a member of Twitter's board of directors, and promised to "help in any way [he

                          development. At that time, he split his schedule with Square (where he is CEO), whose offices are
                          within walking distance of Twitter's in San Francisco.[157] In September 2011, board members and
                          investors Fred Wilson and Bijan Sabet resigned from Twitter's board of directors.[159] In October

                          drops, top projects, and much more! BY Jolene Creighton • May 11, 2023 Daniel Alegre, CEO of Yuga
                          Labs, just made a splash in the NFT world. On May 10, 2023, he purchased a Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT
                          for 50 ETH on Blur. At the time, the purchase was equal to about $90,000. Why is this so notable?
                          When Alegre made his purchase, the floor price for Bored Ape NFTs was about 44 ETH (around
                          $78,000), according to CoinGecko. In short, Alegre used his own money to buy an NFT from his own
                          company — and he bought it for quite a bit more than he needed to. Through his purchase, Alegre
                          likely hoped to demonstrate his belief in the BAYC NFT project and, more broadly, Yuga Labs’
                          portfolio of intellectual properties. Currently, this portfolio includes nearly all of the most
                          widely known and valuable projects in the NFT space — Bored Ape Yacht Club, Otherside, Mutant Ape
                          Yacht Club, Bored Ape Kennel Club, CryptoPunks, and Meebits.

                          These allegations led to a lawsuit being filed by the California Department of Fair Employment and
                          Housing against Activision Blizzard in July 2021. The company has also faced criticism for its
                          handling of the situation and the toxic work environment that allegedly exists within the company.
                          This has resulted in significant public backlash, with some fans and employees calling for boycotts
                          and protests. Alegre’s departure from Activision to Yuga Labs may be seen as a positive move for
                          those who are critical of Activision’s leadership and culture. It’s worth noting that the gaming
                          industry and the NFT space have both been the subject of intense scrutiny and controversy in recent
                          years. The allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination at Activision Blizzard have been a
                          particularly significant source of controversy in the gaming industry. Meanwhile, the NFT space has
                          faced criticism for its environmental impact and the high levels of speculation and price
                          volatility surrounding some NFTs. Furthermore, the recent fake news surrounding Bored Ape Yacht
                          Club (BAYC) highlights the need for responsible and informed reporting in the NFT space. Given
                          these issues, the appointment of Alegre as Yuga Labs’ CEO marks an interesting new phase for the
                          company. As Yuga Labs continues to expand its presence in the NFT gaming space, it will be
                          important for the company to navigate these complex issues with transparency and responsibility.

                          come, similar to the first movie. “Historically James Cameron’s movies are about the long haul, not
                          the opening weekend,” said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. “‘Avatar’ is
                          going to develop its box office over time. It’s about where it will end up months from now.”
                          Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to
                          Comscore, with Wednesday through Sunday in parentheses. Final domestic figures will be released
                          Monday. 1. “Avatar: The Way of Water,” $134 million. 2. “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,” $5.4
                          million. 3. “Violent Night,” $5 million. 4. “Strange World,” $2.2 million. 5. “The Menu,” $1.7

                          Domestically, “Avatar: The Way of Water” was released in 4,202 theaters on over 12,000 screens, 400
                          of which were IMAX 3D. The studio and filmmakers bet big on the draw, and higher prices, of the 3D
                          format and premium large screens. By the end of Friday, “Avatar: The Way of Water” had already
                          earned $53 million in the U.S. and Canada and $180.1 million globally, aided by a China release —
                          the first major Hollywood release in the country since “Minions: The Rise of Gru” in August. It
                          blows “Avatar’s” $26.7 million first day in 2009 out of the water, though that didn’t include
                          Thursday previews. As with many ambitious Cameron projects, from “Titanic” to the first “Avatar,”
                          nerves were high for the costly sequel, one of the most expensive of all time, which began
                          production five years ago. It faced repeated delays and weathered The Walt Disney Co’s acquisition
                          of 21st Century Fox in 2019. It’s also one of four “Avatar” sequels Cameron had in mind. Filming on

                          Square Enix has confirmed that the Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters, which are essentially upgraded
                          versions of Final Fantasy 1-6, will be released on Nintendo Switch and PS4 on April 19, 2023. The
                          Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters are currently available on PC and mobile, and soon a new audience
                          will be able to experience much of the history of the Final Fantasy franchise in a new way. If that
                          wasn't exciting enough, these versions come with a new pixel font, which seems to address one of
                          the biggest issues fans had with the games when they first were released - the questionable choice
                          of font by Square Enix for these remasters that left many unhappy. There will also be a new option
                          to switch between the original and new background music whenever you so choose, and there are more
                          options to adjust encounter rate, EXP, Gil, and ABP. All six games will be available on April 19 at
                          8am PT/11am ET/4pm BST, and fans will be able to purchase them individually or as a complete
                          package. On the eShop, the games range from $11.99-$17.99 per game, and all six can be purchased
                          for $74.99. For more, check out seven things you probably didn't know about Final Fantasy 1-3 and

                          its remarkable run of accolades, from the Golden Globes to the Baftas. Del Toro has used the
                          platform afforded by his nominations to champion the medium of animation as true cinema,
                          proclaiming in his Bafta award speech: Animation is not a genre for kids. It’s a medium for art,
                          it’s a medium for film and I think animation should stay in the conversation. His rendition of
                          Pinocchio has certainly started a conversation, not least in gaining an impressive audience on
                          Netflix. His film demonstrates that in the right creative environment – and with an innovator at
                          the helm – a well-worn narrative, such as Pinocchio, can evolve. Such revitalisation of the
                          Pinocchio story was in part possible because – as he says himself – del Toro didn’t craft his
                          retelling solely with children in mind.

                          A new co-orbital asteroid for Earth? @AdrienCoffinet noticed that newly-discovered asteroid 2022 YG
                          has been circling Earth as a quasi asteroid since 1961 and will continue to do so until 2181. More
                          observations may refine this. pic.twitter.com/FJ5IkTotaV Visualizations of the orbital data for
                          2022 YG show it taking an odd path around our planet, stretching into an elongated ellipse in one
                          direction, then migrating back to a more circular orbit and stretching out again in the other
                          direction before the whole cycle repeats itself. Watching the asteroid's projected path over a
                          period of a few centuries is oddly hypnotic in this visualization posted to YouTube. Previous "mini
                          moons" included asteroids 2020 CD3 and 2006 RH120, but both only stayed for a relatively short
                          time. More observations are needed to refine the apparent orbit of 2022 YG to see if it truly will
                          be with us deep into the next century. There have been mini-moon false alarms in the recent past.
                          An apparent new tiny satellite spotted in 2020 turned out to be a big hunk of space junk from a
                          1960s rocket launch instead.

                          7:06 into the game. Jed Pietila fed Logan backdoor through traffic, and he corralled the pass and
                          flipped in his fifth goal of the season.

Question 237              : What is the price of Microsoft 365 Basic per month?
Correct Answers         :  
                          $1.99
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prediction (only positive):
  - Answer              : $1.99
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          The main difference between the $6.99 Personal subscription and this new $1.99 Basic one (other
                          than the amount of cloud storage) is that Microsoft 365 Basic doesn’t include access to the desktop
                          versions of Word, Excel, and PowerPoint apps. Basic subscribers will have to use the web or mobile
                          versions instead. “We know many people are using our services today, but some of them run out of
                          storage or want additional benefits that you don’t get with the free Microsoft 365 experience,”
                          says Oystryk. “We also designed this specifically with Windows users in mind.” The Microsoft 365
                          Basic package is aimed at Windows users that need extra storage but also feels like Microsoft’s way
                          of familiarizing people with its productivity subscriptions. “Is the Office brand going away
                          entirely? No.” Microsoft is also renaming its Office app on mobile and Windows to Microsoft 365
                          later this month. It reflects the branding changes Microsoft announced last year, where Microsoft
                          Office will largely be referred to as Microsoft 365 going forward. “Is the Office brand going away
                          entirely? No,” explains Oystryk. “We’ve really invested a lot in Microsoft 365 and it’s really
                          become our flagship productivity suite, so Office plays less of a role given that’s where our focus
                          is. You’ll still see Office show up in certain contexts.

                          Everything you need to know about Zack Snyder's new sci-fi movie franchise for Netflix. by Tigran
                          Asatryan Published on January 18th, 2023, 8:00 am EST Picture: Netflix Zack Snyder is teaming up
                          with Netflix to produce and direct two major sci-fi movies: Rebel Moon Part 1 and Part 2. The new
                          movie(s) is described as an epic sci-fi adventure compared with Star Wars in scope and scale.
                          Here’s an updated look at what we can expect from Rebel Moon which is now confirmed to arrive on
                          Netflix in December 2023. Zack Snyder will direct and co-write the film and will reunite with many
                          of his colleagues from past projects. The script for Rebel Moon will be co-written by Shay Hatten,
                          who co-wrote Army of the Dead, and Kurt Johnstad, who worked on 300 with Snyder. The Stone Quarry
                          is the main production company behind the movie with Grand Electric also listed, which is Eric
                          Newman’s production company that has an overall deal with Netflix. Snyder commented on the
                          inspiration for Rebel Moon in his THR interview: “This is me growing up as an Akira Kurosawa fan, a
                          Star Wars fan. It’s my love of sci-fi and a giant adventure.” @Netflix Let's go! https://t.

Question 241              : What was the annual GDP growth rate of the U.S. economy in 2022?
Correct Answers         :  
                          2.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prediction (only positive):
  - Answer              : 2.1 percent
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          7 percent in the third quarter. GDP for 2022 Real GDP increased 2.1 percent in 2022 (from the 2021
                          annual level to the 2022 annual level), compared with an increase of 5.9 percent in 2021 (table 1).
                          The increase in real GDP in 2022 primarily reflected increases in consumer spending, exports,
                          private inventory investment, and nonresidential fixed investment that were partly offset by
                          decreases in residential fixed investment and federal government spending. Imports increased (table
                          2). The increase in consumer spending reflected an increase in services that was partly offset by a
                          decrease in goods. Within services, the increase was led by "other" services (mainly international
                          travel), food services and accommodations, and health care. The decrease in goods primarily
                          reflected decreases in food and beverages as well as motor vehicles and parts that were partly
                          offset by increases in recreational goods and vehicles and "other" nondurable goods (mainly
                          pharmaceuticals). The increase in exports reflected increases in both goods and services. The
                          increase in private inventory investment primarily reflected increases in manufacturing, wholesale
                          trade, and retail trade industries. The increase in nonresidential fixed investment reflected
                          increases in intellectual property products (led by software) and in equipment (led by information
                          processing equipment) that were partly offset by a decrease in structures (led by commercial and
                          health care as well as power and communication structures).

                          nonresidential fixed investment that were partly offset by decreases in residential fixed

                          (table 2). The increase in private inventory investment was led by manufacturing (mainly petroleum
                          and coal products as well as chemicals) as well as mining, utilities, and construction industries
                          (led by utilities). The increase in consumer spending reflected increases in both services and
                          goods. Within services, the increase was led by health care, housing and utilities, and "other"
                          services (notably, personal care services). Within goods, the leading contributor was motor

                          sticks to the comic book formula that the first movie poked fun at, despite another strong comedic
                          performance from star Zachary Levi and some sporadic yuks throughout. It’s schtickier and less
                          assured than the first “Shazam!” but these leftovers still reheat well enough.

                          102][103] This World Cup was the most compact since the inaugural edition in 1930, with 24 of the
                          32 teams being within a 10 km radius of each other, and are concentrated within the Doha area. It
                          was the first Cup since 1930 in which players did not need to take flights to matches and could
                          remain at the same training base throughout the entire tournament.[104][105] FIFA's six continental
                          confederations organised their own qualifying competitions. All 211 FIFA member associations were
                          eligible to enter qualification. The Qatari national team, as hosts, qualified automatically for
                          the tournament. However, the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) obliged Qatar to participate in the
                          Asian qualifying stage as the first two rounds also act as qualification for the 2023 AFC Asian
                          Cup.[106] Since Qatar reached the final stage as winners in their group, Lebanon, the fifth-best
                          second place team, advanced instead.[107] France, the reigning World Cup champions also went
                          through qualifying stages as normal.[108] Saint Lucia initially entered CONCACAF qualification but
                          withdrew from it before their first match. North Korea withdrew from the AFC qualifying round due
                          to safety concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Both American Samoa and Samoa withdrew before
                          the OFC qualification draw.[109] Tonga withdrew after the 2022 Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha'apai eruption
                          and tsunami.

                          channel called Nothing, Forever has been streaming a live, endless AI-generated Seinfeld episode
                          that features pixelated cartoon versions of characters from the TV show. On Monday, Twitch gave the
                          channel a 14-day ban after language model tools from OpenAI went haywire and generated transphobic
                          content that violated community guidelines. Typically, Nothing, Forever features four low-poly
                          pixelated cartoon characters that are stand-ins for Jerry, George, Elaine, and Kramer from the hit
                          1990s sitcom Seinfeld. They sit around a New York apartment and talk about life, and sometimes the
                          topics of conversation unexpectedly get deep, such as in this viewer-captured segment where they
                          discussed the afterlife. Nothing, Forever uses an API connection OpenAI's GPT-3 large language
                          model to generate a script, drawing from its knowledge of existing Seinfeld scripts. Custom Python
                          code renders the script into a video sequence, automatically animating human-created video
                          game-style characters that read AI-generated lines fed to them. One of its creators provided more
                          technical details on how it works in a Reddit comment from December. As a new media experiment, the
                          faux-Seinfeld stream often feels awkward and unfunny, but it's still interesting because viewers
                          never know what the characters will talk about next.

                          “In addition to the third party services we’ve used, we have a lot of proprietary generative
                          algorithms that cause the show to be ‘formed’, so to be speak. We collectively call this logic the
                          ‘director,’ as it is largely responsible for making sure all the individual pieces come together
                          into a whole,” Hartle said via email. “It’s worth mentioning that we don’t generate the artwork or
                          the laugh track — those are precanned assets, but we have ideas on how to do that in the future.”
                          Hartle told Polygon that the look mimicked the era of ’90s point-and-click games that came out
                          around the same time as Seinfeld. “We thought it worked well with the overall vibe of the show and
                          lended itself to the strange/eeriness, too, but the big goal was to have it be thematically
                          relevant,” Hartle said over email. This AI-generated version of Seinfeld doesn’t really compare to
                          the original, but you can definitely see the influence of the original show in snippets of this
                          version. In one part of the stream I watched, the characters started talking about creating a place
                          where they could make their own pizza crust, which appears to be connected to a bit in Seinfeld
                          where Kramer gets a business idea to open a pizzeria where guests make their own pizzas. One
                          popular clip actually has decent dialogue. It’s titled, “Elaine goes out with a guy who hates fruit.

Question 247              : What is the voucher amount per student in the Students First Act?

                          Iowa's public schools are the foundation of our education system. For most families, they are the
                          option of choice – and they should be. But public schools aren’t the only choice, and for some
                          families, a different educational path may be better for their children. Governor Reynolds believes
                          Iowa’s investment in education should support the success of all students, including those whose
                          families choose to enroll them in an accredited private school rather than a public school.
                          Students First Act signed into law On January 24, 2023, Governor Reynolds signed the Students First
                          Act into law, just two weeks after introducing it in her annual Condition of the State address. The
                          bill makes state education funding available for K-12 students who choose to attend private
                          schools. It also provides public schools with additional categorical funding for students who live
                          in their district but attend private schools, and allows public school districts to use unspent
                          money from some categorical funds to supplement teacher salaries. Education Savings Accounts With
                          the passage of the Students First Act, parents who enroll their eligible children in an accredited
                          private school will receive an amount equal to the per pupil funds allocated by the state to all
                          public school districts each year. The funds are estimated at $7,598 per pupil for the 2023-2024
                          school year and will be deposited into an education savings account (ESA) to be used for tuition,
                          fees, and other qualified education expenses.

                          ChatGPT’s meteoric rise in popularity has reportedly prompted Google’s management to declare a
                          “code red” situation for its search product. On Wednesday, Google held an event in its Paris office
                          where the tech giant detailed plans to use AI technology to radically change how people search for
                          information online. Google’s event came one day after rival Microsoft announced a revamped version
                          of Bing powered by a more advanced version of the AI used by ChatGPT. (Microsoft is investing
                          billions in OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT.) In the presentation Wednesday, a Google executive
                          teased plans to use this technology to offer more complex and conversational responses to queries,
                          including providing bullet points ticking off the best times of year to see various constellations
                          and also offering pros and cons for buying an electric vehicle. The executive said AI technology
                          would pave the way for the “next frontier of our information products.” — Anna Cooban in London

                          David Holz discussed the philosophy of Midjourney. Midjourney – an "artistic" AI-powered
                          text-to-image tool – is getting more popular every day, with the community creating awesome (and
                          often really weird) pictures on Discord. But what is Midjourney from the creator's standpoint? The
                          tool's founder David Holz answered this question in a recent interview with The Verge, talking
                          about Midjourney's art style, copyright issues, and what AI is. Midjourney creators see their tool
                          "as an engine for the imagination," "a very positive and humanistic thing." Holz answered the most
                          popular question asked by artists when they deal with such technology: won't AI replace human art
                          one day? "What does it mean when computers are better at visual imagination than 99 percent of
                          humans? That doesn’t mean we will stop imagining. Cars are faster than humans, but that doesn’t
                          mean we stopped walking. When we’re moving huge amounts of stuff over huge distances, we need
                          engines, whether that’s airplanes or boats or cars." Moreover, Midjourney is a social product with
                          its huge Discord server created because "people really like imagining together." This social
                          aspect, however, could potentially cause problems for the AI due to copyright, and while you can’t
                          copyright AI-generated art, some artists might not be happy about technology taking their unique
                          style to train on.

                          He ran the company for twelve years, and when he left it employed about 100 people. Midjourney, he
                          said, is pretty small right now. "We're like about 10 people," he explained. "We're self-funded. We
                          have no investors. We're not really financially motivated. We're just sort of here to work on
                          things we're passionate about and have fun. And we were working on a lot of different projects."
                          Holz said the technological aspect of AI and the extent to which it will improve is fairly easy to
                          foresee. "But the human ramifications of that are so hard to imagine," he said. "There's something
                          here that's at the intersection of humanity and technology. In order to really figure out what this
                          is and what it should be, we really need to do a lot of experiments." The unsettled nature of AI
                          image technology is evident in the difference between tools like Midjourney and a downloadable open
                          source graphics application like Blender, or a locally installed commercial application like Adobe
                          Photoshop (before it became a cloud service). Midjourney exists in a social context. Its front-end
                          is the chat service Discord. New users log in to Discord's Midjourney server and can then submit
                          text prompts to generate images alongside numerous other users in any of the various newbie
                          channels. The resulting images for all the users in that channel surface in about a minute, which
                          helps reinforce the notion of community.

Question 251              : What technology has Microsoft incorporated into the new Bing?

                          questions. Microsoft’s model is clearly far more up-to-date compared to what ChatGPT currently

                          On July 29, 2009, Microsoft and Yahoo! announced that they had made a ten-year deal in which the
                          Yahoo! search engine would be replaced by Bing, retaining the Yahoo! user interface. Yahoo! got to
                          keep 88% of the revenue from all search ad sales on its site for the first five years of the deal,
                          and have the right to sell advertising on some Microsoft sites.[24][25] All Yahoo! Search global
                          customers and partners made the transition by early 2012.[6] On July 31, 2009, The Laptop Company,
                          Inc. stated in a press release that it would challenge Bing's trademark application, alleging that
                          Bing may cause confusion in the marketplace as Bing and their product BongoBing both do online
                          product search.[26] Software company TeraByte Unlimited, which has a product called BootIt Next
                          Generation (abbreviated to BING), also contended the trademark application on similar grounds, as
                          did a Missouri-based design company called Bing! Information Design.[27] Microsoft contended that
                          claims challenging its trademark were without merit because these companies filed for U.S. federal
                          trademark applications only after Microsoft filed for the Bing trademark in March 2009.[28] In
                          October 2011, Microsoft stated that they were working on new back-end search infrastructure with
                          the goal of delivering faster and slightly more relevant search results for users.

                          Pikmin 4 is so close to lanching on the Nintendo Switch, and here's when fans can expect to jump
                          into the digital version. Pikmin 4 is set to launch for the Nintendo Switch on July 21 and marks
                          the newest numbered entry in the real-time strategy series in over ten years, making its release
                          quite the big deal for hardcore fans. Instead of playing as Captain Olimar (who most people know
                          from Super Smash Bros. at this point) or any of his space explorer comrades, gamers will get to
                          customize their own character (a series first). There are not too many options available, but it's
                          still a step forward in terms of a character creator in a Nintendo first-party title. Pikmin 4
                          comes out in a couple of days and retails for $59.99, the same price as most other major games on
                          the Switch. People who decided to pre-order the game digitally via the Switch eShop are probably
                          wondering just when they'll be able to actually boot the game and start playing --that's where this
                          guide comes into play. RELATED: Pikmin 4 Fans Are Paying for Ads of the Game to Appear Over Time
                          Square Before we get into it, it's worth pointing out that this is the expected release time for
                          Pikmin 4 --it has not been officially confirmed by Nintendo just yet.

                          necessarily know the denominator. At the end of the year, Meta had roughly 86,000 employees. Most
                          of those who are being laid off - the 11,000 from last fall - were still on the payroll, the
                          company said.

                          The company’s headcount ballooned during the pandemic from 48,000 on March 31, 2020 to 87,000
                          before layoffs started in November. “We should prepare ourselves for the possibility that this new
                          economic reality will continue for many years.” During Meta’s last earnings call in February,
                          Zuckerberg declared this the “year of efficiency,” even as he continues to spend billions to build
                          out his vision of the metaverse. Since November’s layoffs, he has been focused on reducing layers
                          of management, telling employees in January, “I don’t think you want a management structure that’s
                          just managers managing managers, managing managers, managing managers, managing the people who are
                          doing the work.” In his memo announcing more layoffs, Zuckerberg said that it no longer makes sense
                          for managers to have only “a few” direct reports and confirmed that many of them will be asked to
                          become individual contributors throughout the company. “A leaner org will execute its highest
                          priorities faster,” he wrote. “People will be more productive, and their work will be more fun and
                          fulfilling.” He said Meta will continue canceling low-priority projects throughout the company and
                          that he had “underestimated the indirect costs” of running them. Just yesterday, Meta said it would
                          end work to facilitate the sharing of NFTs on Facebook and Instagram, and a standalone product
                          group for creating new social apps called New Product Experimentation was quietly canned last week.

  - Source              :
                          Super Bowl LVII was an American football game played to determine the champion of the National
                          Football League (NFL) for the 2022 season. The American Football Conference (AFC) champion Kansas
                          City Chiefs defeated the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Philadelphia Eagles, 38–35.
                          The game was played on February 12, 2023, at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. It was the
                          fourth Super Bowl hosted by the Phoenix metropolitan area, and the third at this venue, with the
                          most recent previously being Super Bowl XLIX in 2015 (then known as University of Phoenix
                          Stadium).[6] Both teams finished the regular season with a league-best 14–3 record. This was the
                          Eagles fourth Super Bowl appearance overall and the second in the last six seasons, having
                          previously won Super Bowl LII; the Eagles previously lost Super Bowls XV and XXXIX. This was the
                          Chiefs' fifth Super Bowl appearance overall and third in the last four seasons, having previously
                          won Super Bowls IV and LIV, and losses in Super Bowls I and LV. After the Eagles went into halftime
                          up 24–14, the Chiefs mounted a comeback to win the game 38–35 with a game-winning field goal kicked
                          by Harrison Butker. Butker's game winning kick was set up by a pivotal and controversial defensive
                          holding call on Philadelphia cornerback James Bradberry, which was criticized by some observers but
                          supported by others.

                          Super Bowl LII and losses in Super Bowls XV and XXXIX. The Eagles also won three pre-Super Bowl NFL
                          championships in 1948, 1949, and 1960.[45] The Chiefs entered the playoffs as the No. 1 seed in the
                          AFC. They defeated the Jacksonville Jaguars, 27–20, in the AFC Divisional round. In a tightly
                          contested game, the Chiefs held off a late fourth-quarter rally by the Jaguars. Chiefs quarterback
                          Patrick Mahomes went down early in the game with a high right ankle sprain injury which forced him
                          out of the game for a drive, but he was able to return shortly after leaving.

  - Source              :
                          Given my background as a senior value engineer, I made the obvious leap: Could what they do to
                          train these llamas help us provide a better, more reliable patient experience? After we got home, I
                          called the owner of Wilderness Ridge Llamas to learn how the llamas were trained. The boss told me:
                          If you can’t do it right, don’t do it at all. If you can’t spend all the time training, it won’t be
                          worth it. These were the key principles they used to train the llamas. And while humans may be a
                          long way from llamas in the phylogenetic tree, the principles might work for us, too. Whether
                          llamas or people, you get a reliable experience by training right: Apply these principles to your
                          learners: Every person—and every llama—is different. My llama needed a firmer hand than my son’s.
                          When they train the llamas, they take that into account. They train baby llamas differently than
                          older llamas. They provide a different level of attention and set lower expectations. We can apply
                          that to people, too. Not everyone has the same knowledge or the same skill set. That’s why I like
                          to find out who’s going to be in a class I am teaching. We need to understand people’s backgrounds
                          and where they are coming from so we can present material in the appropriate way. Is the audience
                          medical students or physicians?

                          cloud DVR (no other streaming service compares in terms of DVR storage except for Philo, which
                          offers a niche channel lineup). Like we said, we still really like Hulu + Live TV for its on-demand

                          package—until you notice the lack of filler. There’s no cable-package bloat like audio-only music
                          or shopping networks (except for QVC), just a tight lineup of popular channels like Comedy Central,

                          The twenty-third season of the American reality television series The Voice premiered on March 6,
                          2023, on NBC.[1][2] The season is presented by Carson Daly, who returned for his twenty-third
                          season as host. The panel of coaches for the season consists of Blake Shelton, who returned for his
                          twenty-third and final season as a coach; returning coach Kelly Clarkson, who returned for her
                          ninth season after a one-season hiatus; and debuting coaches Chance the Rapper and Niall Horan.[3]
                          Gina Miles was named as the winner of the season, with the closest margin to-date, on the season
                          finale that aired on May 23, 2023. Her victory marks Niall Horan's first win as a coach, with Horan
                          becoming the third new coach, after Clarkson and John Legend, to win on his debut season, as well
                          as the youngest coach to win a season. On October 11, 2022, NBC announced that the show would be
                          returning for a twenty-third season to be aired in spring 2023.[4][5] Previously, it was announced
                          that, beginning with the 2021–22 United States network television schedule, only one season would
                          be produced per cyclical year,[6] though it was reported that this decision was reversed upon the
                          announcement of the season.[7] Later, it was announced that the season would air on March 6.

                          at their church in Pakistan, handed her a microphone. But then, at 12, Tasha and her family left
                          Pakistan and immigrated to Thailand to escape religious persecution. It was a huge culture shock
                          and forced music into the backseat until they found a church community where Tasha became involved
                          in the worship team. In 2016, Tasha met her now-husband, Maverek, who had been a missionary for

  - Source              :
                          Twitter owner Elon Musk has founded a new artificial intelligence company named X.AI, according to
                          a Nevada business filing from last month. The filing, dated March 9, lists Musk as the company’s
                          sole director and Jared Birchall, who manages Musk’s family office, as its secretary. Musk has been
                          publicly skeptical of the future of artificial intelligence in the past and has even called for a
                          complete AI development pause, citing “risks to society” he says the technology poses. “Recent
                          months have seen AI labs locked in an out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful
                          digital minds that no one – not even their creators – can understand, predict, or reliably
                          control,” a group of tech experts including Musk said in an open letter calling for the development
                          pause last month. In an interview with Fox News’s Tucker Carlson that will air next week, Musk
                          warned that “AI is more dangerous than, say, mismanaged aircraft design or production maintenance
                          or bad car production.” “In the sense that it has the potential — however small one may regard that
                          probability, but it is non-trivial — it has the potential of civilization destruction,” he said.
                          Musk was a co-founder of OpenAI, one of the leading artificial intelligence firms, but left the
                          company in 2018 after a reported internal power struggle. He has reportedly sought to build a rival
                          to OpenAI, recruiting artificial intelligence engineers for a new venture for months.

                          was dissolved as a company this week and was replaced by a new company Musk calls X. The move is
                          seen as an attempt to build a social media platform that also allows payments, turning it into “the
                          everything app,” akin to how apps like WeChat work in China. Twitter announced this week it was
                          partnering with eToro to allow users to be able to trade stocks and crypto. It should be pretty
                          clear by now that Musk’s call for a six-month pause was purely out of self interest in the AI arms
                          race, as I wrote at the time. ChatGPT has become a fascinating tool for people who want to
                          experiment with large language models (LLMs) that answer questions posed in natural language. But
                          there are still a lot of kinks to be worked out, as ChatGPT will often give confident answers, even
                          when it’s wrong. AI is largely a magic trick at this point, sometimes spouting nonsense that users
                          may not know enough about to fact-check. But it’s an interesting magic trick and it’s something
                          that will improved upon as more people in the world of tech become involved. Musk must know he’s
                          behind in the most exciting development on the web since social media went mainstream in the late
                          2000s. But the billionaire clearly doesn’t intend to stay behind for long.

                          big campus celebration events was the Spring Football Game. There were lots of things to look at
                          and analyze but for now, here are some shots and comments from the game. GO HOKIES!!! The crowd was
                          easily over 20,000 people. Hokie Hi weekend featured Friday and Saturday celebrations with an
                          evening tribute to the fallen 32 from April 16th 2007. The morning on Saturday was the 3.2 mile Run
                          and Walk for Remembrance, and the crowd there was estimated to be 15,000 or so. The weather in
                          Blacksburg not only cooperated, it assisted by being comfortably warm, without being hot, and a
                          light breeze was blowing. It was a magnificent way to honor the fallen and celebrate their memories
                          as Hokies. The Maroon Squad Offense was obviously mostly #1s int he depth chart, with Grant Wells
                          starting at Maroon Squad QB. He’d remain there for the first half. We’ll talk about the various
                          observations in a coming article, but overall, he did well and seemed like he was much more
                          comfortable than he was last season. We’ll take that as a major plus, for now.

                          the Year. The 10th to 12th-grade teacher was selected out of five finalists by the Council of Chief
                          State School Officers (CCSSO), a nonprofit organization. "I'm so grateful to represent this
                          incredibly powerful profession," Peterson said Wednesday on "CBS Mornings." Along with teaching,

                          was: I started looking for the good every day, and I started writing fun, good things every day,"

                          State Superintendent of Public Instruction Catherine Truitt said that Jones exemplifies the
                          qualities of teacher leadership that are the bedrock of schools that set high expectations for
                          students while providing the critical support they need to succeed. “Every school needs a Mrs.
                          Jones,” Truitt said. “It’s obvious that students thrive in her classes, and that she makes things
                          happen for the better in her school. I look forward to the contributions she’ll be making across
                          North Carolina as state Teacher of the Year.” Jones succeeds the 2022 Teacher of the Year, Leah
                          Carper, an English teacher at Northern Guilford High School. The N.C. Burroughs Wellcome Teacher of
                          the Year is chosen by a committee of professional educators as well as business and community
                          leaders. The state selection committee members are chosen based on their active public record in
                          support of education. Dr. Lou Muglia, president and CEO of the Burroughs Wellcome Fund, said the
                          foundation continues to be proud to support the North Carolina Teacher of the Year Award.
                          “Congratulations to the Burroughs Wellcome Fund Teacher of the Year – an inspiration to students
                          and a voice for educators,” Muglia said. “The passion, dedication, and unwavering commitment to
                          students' success is a testament to the profound impact that great teachers have on shaping our
                          future generations. We look forward to collaborating with the 2023 North Carolina Teacher of the
                          Year and the regional finalists.

                          In August 2015, Apple revamped the online storefront, removing the dedicated "Store" tab and making
                          the entire website a retail experience.[66][67] Jobs believed the Apple retail program needed to
                          fundamentally change the relationship to the customer, and provide more control over the
                          presentation of Apple products and the Apple brand message. Jobs recognized the limitations of
                          third-party retailing and began investigating options to change the model.[4] In 1999, Jobs
                          personally recruited Millard Drexler, former CEO of Gap Inc., to serve on Apple's board of
                          directors.[4][68][69] In 2000, Jobs hired Ron Johnson from Target. The retail and development teams
                          headed by Allen Moyer from The Walt Disney Company then began a series of mock-ups for the Apple
                          Store inside a warehouse near the company's Cupertino headquarters.[4] On May 15, 2001, Jobs hosted
                          a press event at Apple's first store, located at the Tysons Corner Center mall in Tysons, Virginia,
                          near Washington, D.C.[70] The store officially opened on May 19, along with another store in
                          Glendale Galleria in Glendale, California.[70][4][71] More than 7,700 people visited Apple's first
                          two stores in the opening weekend, spending a total of US$599,000.[72] Several publications and
                          analysts predicted the failure of Apple Stores.

                          Sundar Pichai received $226 million in total compensation in 2022, most of which came through stock
                          awards, according to a securities report filed by the company on Friday. Pichai was awarded $218
                          million in equities last year through a triennial stock grant. His annual salary was $2 million
                          from 2020 to 2022, the filing stated. The CEO's compensation package also included almost $6
                          million for personal security in 2022. Other Alphabet and Google principal executives made
                          approximately $22 million to $35 million in annual stock awards, according to the filing. The
                          report comes as Alphabet is initiating cost restructuring measures, including layoffs in January
                          that eliminated 12,000 workers, or 6% of its workforce.

                          So, so much AI Google I/O 2023 was held on May 10. While many of the talks and presentations at I/O
                          are developer focused, the event started, as always, with a flashy keynote address to let us all
                          know what Google's been up to lately. This year, that includes both hardware and software — and, as
                          you might imagine, lots and lots of talk about AI. Here's everything you need to know. At I/O,
                          Google not only fully revealed its next midrange phone, the Pixel 7a, but also surprise-announced
                          that the phone is available to purchase — not preorder — right now, for $499. The phone shares a
                          lot of DNA with the $600 Pixel 7, including its Tensor G2 chipset, eight gigs of RAM, and design,
                          which is nearly indistinguishable from its more expensive cousin. If you're interested to learn
                          more, we've got a full review for you to check out. Interestingly, the Pixel 6a will remain on
                          offer at a lower price point: $350. As anticipated, Google showed off its first foldable at I/O
                          this year. The Pixel Fold's got a refreshingly normal-looking 5.8" screen on the outside and a 7.6"
                          display (with some pretty substantial bezels) on the inside.

                          The company unveiled the much-rumored Pixel Fold and Pixel 7a at the May 2023 event and revealed an
                          update to the previously announced Pixel Tablet. The Google Pixel Tablet features Google Tensor G2,
                          a chip that uses AI to provide you with a personalized experience; it comes as a package with a
                          charging speaker dock. Google Pixel Fold, which has a 7.6-inch display when unfolded, is also
                          outfitted with Google Tensor G2 and adapts to how you want to use it. The 2023 Google I/O event
                          also focused heavily on integrating generative AI into Google's existing products and LLM-driven
                          new apps and functionalities. In addition to Smart Reply and Smart Compose, Gmail will have a Help
                          Me Write feature that helps you write complete emails in just a few seconds. Google Maps now
                          includes an immersive view for route previews by bike, car, or on foot. Google Photos offers a
                          Magic Editor with advanced editing capabilities to remove unwanted objects from images, change
                          backgrounds, and even center out-of-frame images. Now that Google has ended the wait list for its
                          LLM, Bard is freely available. Google has improved Bard with new features that let you export text
                          to Gmail, Google Docs, and Google Sheets. In addition, Google will add tools to Bard, including
                          services and extensions to enhance the user experience. For example, you can describe an image, and
                          Bard will generate a series of pictures.

                          assassin Villanelle on the television show “Killing Eve.” By Sarah Bahr The leading actress in a
                          play category this year was a face-off of extremes: Jodie Comer, who delivers a physically and
                          emotionally exhausting performance in Suzie Miller’s one-woman legal thriller “Prima Facie,” versus
                          Jessica Chastain, who scarcely stirs from her chair during the entirety of “A Doll’s House.” In the
                          end, it was Comer who triumphed, for her tour-de-force solo turn as a lawyer who defends men
                          accused of sexual assault. Jesse Green, the chief theater critic for The New York Times, described
                          it as “a performance of tremendous skill and improbable stamina.” It was a remarkable win for the
                          30-year-old English actress, who is best known for playing the assassin Villanelle on the
                          television show “Killing Eve.” She not only took home her first Tony Award on her first try; she
                          won it for her first performance on a major stage. “It kind of felt unattainable,” she told The
                          Times in April of the prospect of doing theater. On Sunday night, Comer thanked Suzie Miller, the
                          writer of “Prima Facie,” which won many awards in Australia and Britain.

                          Dating apps, meanwhile, still require a level of manual work (swiping, messaging, responding) that
                          can become cumbersome and exhausting. That is what drove Dmitri Mirakyan, 28, a data scientist in
                          New York, to develop YourMove.ai, an AI dating tool that helps users begin and respond to messages.
                          “This past summer, I got really tired of sifting through and trying to come up with responses on
                          dating apps,” he said. “So I tried to see if GPT3 could flirt. It turns out it could. A month
                          later, I built the first version [of the platform] on a Saturday.” Unlike Rizz and a similar app
                          called Keys, Your Move does not yet plug into a user’s keyboard, and you must enter messages
                          manually and it will generate a response. However, Mirakyan says a keyboard update is coming soon.
                          Mirakyan said that he has always struggled with social interaction and reading social cues, and
                          that he built the app for those like him who need help making digital communication seamless.
                          “There’s such a gap currently in what people like myself want to communicate and how it comes
                          across,” he said. “Just trying to be honest or communicate a point [can mean] not reading the room
                          or stumbling over ourselves.” Users across the country are embracing the app’s ability to generate
                          responses to romantic messages. Mario Pennetti, a 24-year-old in the Daytona Beach, Fla.

                          Mirakyan's interest in an app like his, however, seems to go deeper than Lloyd's term paper
                          comparison. Speaking to WaPo, he explained that he's always had a difficult time reading social
                          cues — a dating stressor that a tool like YourMove.ai helps to alleviate. "There's such a gap
                          currently," he told the newspaper, "in what people like myself want to communicate and how it comes
                          across." That's sympathetic, in a sense, and we could see how AI assistance might benefit folks who
                          have a tough time socially. At the same time, however, balance is definitely still needed here.
                          Romance is one of the most human things out there, and the digital dating world is robotic enough
                          as it is. Do we really want everyone on the apps just passing AI-generated quips and complements
                          back and forth for eternity? That's starting to sound like The Sims — and as humans, maybe we
                          should shoot a little higher. More on post-AI online dating: Man "Sure" His AI Girlfriend Will save

                          much about it yet. New U.S. Soccer Federation’s sporting director Matt Crocker clearly knows a lot

                          He is driven, he’s creative, and committed to building relationships at every level of the game.”
                          Crocker, who succeeds Earnie Stewart in the role, also isn’t entirely new to America. Seated

                          Games, she will also manage the overall technical plan for the Women’s National Team program, which

                          it made for something of a perfect present. But while seeing himself in a game didn’t faze the

                          playing it, and it would be really weird,” he tells StarWars.com, laughing. As a joke, Monaghan
                          would sit near friends, echoing the game’s dialogue or Cal’s grunts and screams as they happened
                          on-screen. “I remember my friends being really tripped out. ‘What’s happening?!’” In Jedi: Fallen
                          Order, set during the age of the Empire and Jedi-hunting Inquisitors, Cal was just looking to lay
                          low and exist until fate intervened. Though his training was incomplete, he was thrust back into
                          the fight and the ways of the Jedi; the rest is gaming history.

                          Fallen Order arrived in November 2019, Cameron Monaghan had an easy holiday gift for family and
                          friends. Monaghan had played the game’s protagonist, Cal Kestis, a Padawan survivor of Order 66, so
                          it made for something of a perfect present. But while seeing himself in a game didn’t faze the
                          actor, the same can’t be said for his loved ones. “I’d go over [to] their house and they’d be
                          playing it, and it would be really weird,” he tells StarWars.com, laughing. As a joke, Monaghan
                          would sit near friends, echoing the game’s dialogue or Cal’s grunts and screams as they happened
                          on-screen. “I remember my friends being really tripped out. ‘What’s happening?!’” In Jedi: Fallen
                          Order, set during the age of the Empire and Jedi-hunting Inquisitors, Cal was just looking to lay
                          low and exist until fate intervened. Though his training was incomplete, he was thrust back into
                          the fight and the ways of the Jedi; the rest is gaming history.

  - Answer              : Tamara Jenkins
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          Manzoor lists directors Mira Nair (The Namesake) and Deepa Mehta (Elements trilogy) as two people
                          who inspire her, since they feature South Asian women in their projects. "It made me believe that
                          our stories are worth being told," Manzoor says, noting that she also looks up to Pedro Almodóvar.
                          "He centered women in a way that I hadn't experienced before." Tamara Jenkins' 1998 debut film
                          Slums of Beverly Hills, which is about a teenage girl struggling to grow up in a lower-middle-class
                          nomadic Jewish family that relocates every few months, made Manzoor feel seen as a teenager. "Each
                          of her movies expresses a real truth of womanhood and there's a rawness to her work that I
                          gravitate to," she explains. In addition to Slums of Beverly Hills, Jenkins directed The Savages
                          and Private Life. Since Manzoor is focused on telling women-centric tales, it makes sense that Jane
                          Austen's works have always resonated with her. "There's something in the way she explores the
                          pressure of society and being a woman who wants to strike out on her own," she says. Polite Society
                          is in theaters now.

                          The Chinese city of Chengdu will be the host city for The World Games 2025. On Thursday 9 May, in
                          Gold Coast, Australia, the Mayor of Chengdu, Mr Luo Qiang, signed the Organiser Agreement for the

                          of the International World Games Association. This was preceded by ratification of the contract by

                          Convention in Gold Coast. Chengdu follows the city of Birmingham, Alabama as host. The 11th edition

                          in China, we have signalled our arrival as a major power in international sport.” The IWGA
                          President added: ”Following our 2021 event in another great country, the USA, we are excited now to
                          start work with our Chinese partners on plans for 2025.” Chengdu Mayor, Mr Luo Qiang, said:
                          "Chengdu highly appreciates the concept of the IWGA and believe that it is in line with Chengdu's
                          development philosophy.

                          competes for the title of Ultimate Firefighter at the World Police and Fire Games. The
                          international competition is set to come to Birmingham in 2025. The Magic City will host the World
                          Police and Fire Games (WPFG), an event featuring more than 10,000 first responders competing in
                          1,600 medal events, from June 27 to July 6, 2025. The city’s successful bid for the event was
                          announced in May by local officials and The World Police and Fire Games Federation. “From the
                          beginning, we were impressed by all that Birmingham has to offer,” said LC Collins, president of
                          the WPFG. “We believe that this city is the whole package – from its venues, infrastructure and
                          history of hosting major events, to its entertainment, dining and attractions." The decision comes
                          following a presentation to the Federation’s Board of Directors by the Birmingham Bid Committee,
                          which was led by the Greater Birmingham Convention and Visitors Bureau, the city of Birmingham and
                          Jefferson County. The games are “expected to have an economic impact of $75 million on the
                          Birmingham region and will showcase our home to over 150,000 people between athletes, supporters
                          and spectators,” said Jefferson County Commissioner Steve Ammons. Events will be hosted at more
                          than 35 venues around the city and will be free and open for all spectators.

Question 287              : When was Pixel Fold announced?
Correct Answers         :

                          For charging, the Pixel Fold supports 21W wired speeds. However, you’ll have to purchase Google’s
                          30W power adapter ($25 at Google Store) separately. The phone also supports wireless charging at up
                          to 7.5W and will work with any Qi wireless charger. No. Furthermore, the Google Pixel does not
                          support pen/stylus input. The Pixel Fold’s inner display is protected by Ultra Thin Glass, complete
                          with a protective plastic layer applied. Gorilla Glass Victus protects the external display. Yes.
                          The Google Pixel Fold has an IPX8 certification, which means it can be submerged in up to 1.5
                          meters of freshwater for up to 30 minutes. No, Google no longer includes chargers with its
                          smartphones. You’ll have to buy a compatible charger that supports USB Power Delivery PPS. The
                          Google Pixel Fold supports dual SIMs. One is a nano-SIM slot, and the second is via eSIM. The Pixel
                          Fold was announced on May 10, 2023. General availability of the phone will commence in June 2023.
                          Folding phones are great for those who want a large-screen device but don’t want the size penalty
                          of carrying a tablet. Based on our hands-on experience, the Pixel Fold should also be a great
                          traditional handset when folded. There’s no indication that Google is working on a second, smaller
                          flip phone to partner the Pixel Fold or challenge the Galaxy Z Flip series.

                          Google's first foldable phone isn't coming for a few more weeks. The Google Pixel Fold is on
                          preorder at AT&T and Verizon. Google's Pixel Fold is nearing its release, but there may be a bit of
                          a delay. After being announced at Google I/O in May, Google's first foldable is just now getting
                          some release updates, this time from AT&T and Verizon. On Tuesday, AT&T announced that it will
                          begin its own preorders for the Pixel Fold and introduced a deal that offered new and existing AT&T
                          users the Pixel Fold for $25 per month without needing to trade in a device. To get that discount
                          you will need to be on an unlimited plan and commit to a 36-month installment plan. All told, the
                          carrier is willing to cover $900, or half of the Pixel Fold's regular $1,799 starting price for the
                          256GB model (not including taxes). Oddly, purchasing the 256GB model outright from the carrier is
                          $1,880, or $81more than the unlocked version you could buy directly from Google. Verizon previously
                          said it would begin accepting preorders for the foldable on June 20, and said the device would go
                          on sale on June 27.

                          budget-friendly Pixel 7a, Google’s first folding handset is finally here. The highly-anticipated
                          Pixel Fold will compete for your attention in a quickly crowding foldable phones market of which
                          Samsung is currently king. Here’s everything you need to know about the Google Pixel Fold. Google
                          officially unveiled the Pixel Fold at Google I/O on March 10, 2023. It comes in two colors —
                          Obsidian and Porcelain. You can also choose between three official Pixel Fold cases that come in
                          Hazel, Porcelain, and Bay colors (pictured above). Google is charging a similar price to the rival
                          Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4. The 256GB variant of the Pixel Fold will cost you a whopping $1,799. The
                          512GB version is even more expensive at $1,919, which seems costly for Google’s first attempt at a
                          foldable phone. Google hopes you buy the foldable Pixel for its thin form factor, “true pocket
                          size,” loaded camera features, “all-day battery,” multi-tasking skills, and long-lasting software
                          support. However, we’ll only know if it justifies that price when we review the device. As for
                          availability, Google is not casting a very wide net for the Pixel Fold. The handset will only sell
                          in the US, UK, Germany, and Japan, at least to start with.

Question 288              : What is the name of Google's foldable smartphone?
Correct Answers         :  
                          Pixel Fold
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prediction (only positive):
  - Answer              : Pixel Fold
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          Google (GOOG, GOOGL) debuted its Pixel Fold smartphone at its annual I/O developers conference in
                          Mountain View, CA. on Wednesday. The phone, which—hold your breath—will cost $1,799, is Google’s
                          first foldable handset, and its first ultra premium device. The company also revealed its low-cost
                          Pixel 7A at the show. Like Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 4, the Pixel Fold opens up like a book, allowing
                          users to take advantage of its front display, or its larger tablet-like inner screen. Google says
                          the Pixel Fold’s 5.8-inch external display should feel just like a standard smartphone screen
                          whether surfing the web or checking TikTok. That would be a sharp contrast from Samsung’s Z Fold,
                          which uses a larger, though thinner 6.2-inch outer screen that can feel cramped while doing things
                          like typing messages. Inside, the Pixel Fold gets a 7.6-inch panel that folds directly down its
                          center line. The Z Fold packs a similar internal display, though it looks as though Samsung’s
                          offering has thinner bezels around its inner screen. Google also claims that the Pixel Fold is the
                          thinnest foldable on the market whether folded or unfolded. That should come as a relief to
                          consumers who’ve balked at Samsung’s bulky Z Fold’s design.

                          Google is also banking on two more conventional devices as it attempts again to make headway in the
                          hardware market. The Pixel 7a looks like last year’s Pixel 7, but uses more basic components and
                          trims back the list of features. Its screen is 25% brighter than the preceding model and has a
                          faster, 90-hertz refresh rate. There’s also face unlock, enhanced camera zoom, and a 64-megapixel
                          rear camera, making it one of the more compelling low-end smartphones. A year after announcing the
                          product, Google shared more details about its tablet. The device’s specifications — including the
                          company’s G2 processor, 128GB of storage, 8MP front and rear cameras and hardware design — are by
                          this point dated compared with rival devices. Its price — $499 — also eclipses some iPad models,
                          though the Google device includes a home dock to stand it upright. While docked, the device will be
                          geared toward video watching, controlling appliances and viewing photo slideshows. © 2023 Fortune

                          Pixel 7A at the show. Like Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 4, the Pixel Fold opens up like a book, allowing
                          users to take advantage of its front display, or its larger tablet-like inner screen. Google says
                          the Pixel Fold’s 5.8-inch external display should feel just like a standard smartphone screen
                          whether surfing the web or checking TikTok. That would be a sharp contrast from Samsung’s Z Fold,
                          which uses a larger, though thinner 6.2-inch outer screen that can feel cramped while doing things
                          like typing messages. Inside, the Pixel Fold gets a 7.6-inch panel that folds directly down its
                          center line. The Z Fold packs a similar internal display, though it looks as though Samsung’s
                          offering has thinner bezels around its inner screen. Google also claims that the Pixel Fold is the
                          thinnest foldable on the market whether folded or unfolded. That should come as a relief to
                          consumers who’ve balked at Samsung’s bulky Z Fold’s design.

                          market remains red hot. That's great for workers, but it's bound to reinforce concerns about high
                          inflation. Hiring surged last month as U.S. employers added 339,000 jobs, far above expectations,
                          according to a report from the Labor Department on Friday. The job gains for March and April were
                          also stronger than previously reported. The April jobs figure was revised up by 41,000, while the
                          March number was revised up by 52,000. The strong jobs numbers indicate the U.S. jobs engine
                          continues to chug along, with substantial hiring in business services, health care and hospitality.
                          Construction companies added 25,000 jobs last month even as high interest rates have weighed on the
                          housing market. The unemployment rate, which is compiled from a separate survey, paints a less rosy
                          picture. Unemployment, which been at a half century low, inched up in May to 3.7%.

                          Unemployment remains low and hiring eases as more workers enter the labor force. Key points:
                          There’s good news for every audience in this jobs report. Workers will be happy that unemployment
                          remains low, and those out of work are still able to find jobs quickly. Employers will be pleased
                          that labor force participation continues to grow, particularly for prime-age workers. And
                          policymakers at the Federal Reserve will be comforted by the gradual cooldown in the pace of
                          hiring. The US labor market is on a smooth trajectory, but turmoil in the financial market could
                          cause turbulence. This labor market continues to work for workers. Unemployment is very low, but
                          the continued progress in enticing people into the workforce is perhaps more encouraging. The labor
                          force participation rate for workers ages 25 to 54 hit a level previously seen in March 2008, and
                          the last time the employment rate for these workers was this high was May 2001. The number of
                          workers who were unemployed because they had recently lost a job dropped in April, reversing a
                          concerning rise seen in recent months. Payroll job gains continued to moderate, with the
                          three-month moving average ticking down to 222,000 in April, less than half of what it was a year
                          ago. The slowing job gains might concern some people, but this rate of growth is well above the
                          level needed to keep the unemployment rate steady. Furthermore, the slowdown in hiring will
                          encourage monetary policymakers that the labor market continues to shift into a better balance.

                          May 11, 2023, marks the end of the federal COVID-19 PHE declaration. After this date, CDC’s
                          authorizations to collect certain types of public health data will expire. The United States has
                          mobilized and sustained a historic response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a nation, we now find
                          ourselves at a different point in the pandemic – with more tools and resources than ever before to
                          better protect ourselves and our communities. CDC has been working for many months to fold the
                          agency’s COVID-19 emergency response activities into its existing structure and programs, as part
                          of an ongoing transition to sustainable public health practice. The agency has also been working
                          with partners, including states and local territories, to prepare for the end of the PHE
                          declaration and communicate updated reporting requirements and cadences. While reporting frequency
                          and source data for some metrics will shift when the PHE declaration ends, CDC will continue to
                          report valuable data to inform individual and community public health actions to protect those at
                          highest risk of severe COVID-19. Our priority remains providing the information necessary to
                          protect the nation’s public health. Most tools, like vaccines, treatments, and testing, will remain
                          available. But, some tools, like certain data sources and reporting, will change. Access to
                          COVID-19 vaccines will generally not be affected for now. The U.S. government is currently
                          distributing free COVID-19 vaccines for all adults and children.

                          vaccination are set to end on October 1, 2024. These rules allowed, for example, pharmacy interns,
                          healthcare providers with recently expired licenses and those licensed to work only in one state to
                          give COVID-19 vaccines. There is ongoing deliberation at the federal level and in the courts in
                          this area. For more information on Healthcare Provider Flexibilities, visit the Public Health

                          According to Alan Cooper, the "Father of Visual Basic", the concept of Clippit was based on a
                          "tragic misunderstanding" of research conducted at Stanford University, showing that the same part
                          of the brain in use while using a mouse or keyboard was also responsible for emotional reactions
                          while interacting with other human beings and thus is the reason people yell at their computer
                          monitors.[11] Microsoft concluded that if humans reacted to computers the same way they react to
                          other humans, it would be beneficial to include a human-like face in their software.[11] As people
                          already related to computers directly as they do with humans, the added human-like face emerged as
                          an annoying interloper distracting the user from the primary conversation.[11] First introduced in
                          Microsoft Office 97,[12] the Office Assistant was codenamed TFC during development.[13] It appeared
                          when the program determined the user could be assisted by using Office wizards, searching help, or
                          advising users on using Office features more effectively. It also presented tips and keyboard
                          shortcuts. For example, typing an address followed by "Dear" would cause the Assistant to appear
                          with the message, "It looks like you're writing a letter. Would you like help?" Microsoft turned
                          off the feature by default in Office XP.[14] The feature was removed altogether in Office 2007 and
                          Office 2008 for Mac.

Question 292              : What is the name of Google's AI image editing tool?
Correct Answers         :  
                          Magic Editor
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prediction (only positive):
  - Answer              : Magic Editor
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          By Jay Peters, a news editor who writes about technology, video games, and virtual worlds. He’s
                          submitted several accepted emoji proposals to the Unicode Consortium. Google’s latest Photos trick
                          is a feature it’s calling Magic Editor, which uses generative AI to let you make major edits to a
                          photo without professional tools. The company revealed the feature at Google I/O 2023. Google
                          shared a couple examples of Magic Editor in action that are both pretty cool. In one, a photo of a
                          person in front of a waterfall, Google entirely moves the person further to the side of the photo,
                          erases people in the background, and makes the sky a prettier blue. Watch this GIF to see it all
                          happen: In another photo, Magic Editor scoots a child on a bench closer to the middle of the photo,
                          which generates “new” parts of the bench and balloons to the left to fill in the space. In this
                          example, Google again makes the sky more vibrant. Check it out in this GIF: It’s impressive stuff —
                          and a logical next step from photo features like Photo Unblur and Magic Eraser. It’s also not quite
                          perfect given leftover artifacts like creases from the bag strap in the waterfall photo and a
                          misplaced shadow under the bench in the second.

  - Source              :
                          The draft is conducted under the eligibility rules established in the league's 2017 collective
                          bargaining agreement (CBA) with its players' union, with special modifications agreed to by both
                          parties due to disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The previous CBA that ended the 2011
                          lockout instituted no immediate changes to the draft, but it called for a committee of owners and
                          players to discuss further charges. Players who were not automatically eligible had to declare
                          their eligibility for the draft by notifying the NBA offices in writing no later than at least 60
                          days before the event. For the 2023 draft, the date fell on April 23. Under the CBA a player may
                          withdraw his name from consideration from the draft at any time before the final declaration
                          deadline, which usually falls 10 days before the draft at 5:00 pm EDT (2100 UTC). Under current
                          NCAA rules, players usually have until 10 days after the draft combine to withdraw from the draft
                          and retain college eligibility. They must have withdrawn on or before May 31, 22 days prior to this
                          draft.[70] A player who has hired an agent retains his remaining college eligibility regardless of
                          whether he is drafted after an evaluation from the NBA Undergraduate Advisory Committee. Players
                          who declare for the NBA draft and are not selected have the opportunity to return to their school
                          for at least another year only after terminating all agreements with their agents, who must have
                          been certified.[73]

Question 296              : What is the name of Apple's headset?
Correct Answers         :  
                          Vision Pro
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prediction (only positive):
  - Answer              : Apple Vision Pro
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          Design wise, Apple Vision Pro is not unlike a pair of ski goggles, featuring a singular piece of
                          laminated glass for the front that melds into an aluminum alloy frame. A soft, fitted Light Seal
                          attaches magnetically to the frame and conforms to your face to block out light. Two Audio Straps
                          with built-in speakers are positioned at the sides of the headset, delivering Spatial Audio that
                          blends what you're hearing on the headset with what's going on in the real world. The Audio Straps
                          connect to a 3D knitted headband that holds the Vision Pro in place. Apple designed it to be
                          breathable, cushiony, and stretchy for comfort, and a Fit Dial ensures the headset fits tight
                          against your head. Apple plans to offer Light Seals and headbands in multiple sizes, and these
                          components are swappable. Inside the frame, there are two micro-OLED displays that deliver over 4K
                          resolution to each eye for a total of 23 million pixels. There's also an external display called
                          EyeSight that projects an image of your eyes so people can tell whether you're using the headset in
                          an immersive mode or if you can see what's going on around you. For glasses wearers, there are
                          custom prescription Zeiss Optical Inserts that can be attached magnetically to the headset's
                          lenses. playSubscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel for more videos.

                          According to Kuo, the lenses will bring electronics from the era of "visible computing" to
                          "invisible computing." There is "no visibility" for the contact lenses at the current time, and
                          it's not a guaranteed product that Apple will develop. Apple was also developing augmented reality
                          "Apple Glasses" that were supposed to launch a year or so after the headset, but the project has
                          been placed on hold so the company can instead focus on a cheaper version of the AR/VR headset.
                          Apple Glasses are expected to launch in 2027 at the earliest. A future version of the AR/VR headset
                          could have accessibility settings that are designed to help people who suffer from eye diseases and
                          visual issues. MacRumors attracts a broad audience of both consumers and professionals interested

                          Katherine "Kate" Ryder is an American entrepreneur and advocate for improving women's and family
                          healthcare.[2] She is the founder and CEO of digital health company Maven Clinic.[3] Ryder was born
                          in Minnesota.[1] She attended the University of Michigan as part of the LSA Honors program, where
                          she double majored in English and Political Science. She obtained a bachelor's degree.[4] After
                          graduating, Ryder moved to Spain to teach English in the public school system.[1] She later
                          attended the London School of Economics and earned a master's degree in anthropology.[2] Ryder
                          later wrote for The Economist from Southeast Asia, New York and London, and also for The New Yorker
                          and The Wall Street Journal.[1][5] In 2009, she also helped former U.S. Treasury Secretary Hank
                          Paulson write his memoirs, On The Brink.[6][7] She moved to London from Singapore in 2011.[4][1] In
                          2012, Ryder left the field of journalism and joined Index Ventures, a venture capital firm.[8][9]
                          For two years, she worked with venture capital across Europe and the US, and focused early-stage
                          investments, including digital health.[4] Seeing her friends struggle with building a family and
                          child rearing while balancing careers gave her the idea of a startup to improve healthcare for
                          women and families.[8]

                          request an invitation to score some (so-called) exclusive deals on items that are expected to sell
                          out. We’re waiting to see what these deals entail, but we anticipate seeing discounts on everything
                          from robot vacuums and smart TVs to exercise equipment and small appliances.
