                          Taylor: Just Call Out My Name will premiere on CNN in 2022, while domestic streaming and
                          international distribution rights will go to HBO Max. Directed and produced by Frank Marshall—who
                          released the acclaimed The Bee Gees: How Can You Mend a Broken Heart in 2020—Carole King & James
                          Taylor: Just Call Out My Name dives into one of the most famed friendships in music history. “I’ve
                          been listening to and playing their music my whole life, so it’s especially meaningful to me and
                          such an honor to be able to put together (a film about) this special reunion concert by these two
                          extraordinarily gifted friends,” Marshall said in a statement, reported by Variety. The film title
                          is derived from a lyric in King’s “You’ve Got A Friend.” The two often shared songs and ensuing
                          success, but this particular track is a signature of both of their individual solo careers, penned
                          and released as part of King’s 1971 album Tapestry. She notes that the song is a response to
                          Taylor’s “Fire and Rain.” Taylor’s cover from Mud Slide Slim and the Blue Horizon in 1971 hit No.1
                          and both versions went on to win Grammys.

                          documentary, Carole King & James Taylor: Just Call Out My Name, to kick off 2022. The documentary
                          opens with a montage featuring the late night hosts. This is before the film gets into the main
                          focus: the 2010 Troubadour Reunion Tour featuring the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame members
                          (Taylor-2000, King-1990 and 2021). The Troubadour shows took place over a series of days in
                          November 2007 with the international concert tour following in 2010. Marshall is privy to exclusive
                          footage from the tour. Both King and Taylor reminisce on their 50-year relationship during
                          exclusive interviews. They also discuss the history behind the songs. Taylor even mentions wanting
                          King to be apart of his band. Music history would have definitely changed, for better or worse.
                          Peter Asher talks about introducing drummer Ross Kunkel to Taylor. Danny “Kootch” Kortchmar is one
                          of Taylor’s oldest friends. Leland Sklar, another friend of Taylor, joined the band and played
                          bass. Asher had met Carole King and invited her to play piano on Taylor’s sophomore album, Sweet
                          Baby James.

                          Kinglsey family who underwrites the funding for the hospital. As the hospital's new head of
                          finance, he also serves as a love interest for Sam, who is just getting over a previous
                          relationship. Sam's team of doctors (Skye P. Marshall, Omar Maskati, Davi Santos, Michael
                          Stahl-David) round out the secondary characters, most notably Marshall, who plays Dr. Lex Trulie,
                          her best friend hiding a huge secret. Overall, Good Sam riffs on what CBS is known for --
                          comforting problem-of-the-week dramas -- and adds a new level of spice and interest to the
                          proceedings. Fans of the genre will undoubtedly want to go on the ride Good Sam has in store for

                          demonstrate great leadership? How does Sam provide compassion and empathy to her patients and
                          fellow doctors? Why does Sam feel unappreciated? How did she prove herself in the show? How should
                          Sam's father, Dr. Rob Griffith, treat his daughter? Research shows a connection between kids'

                          The 2022 Citrus Bowl was a college football bowl game played on January 1, 2022, with kickoff at
                          1:00 p.m. EST and televised on ABC.[4] It was the 76th edition of the Citrus Bowl, and was one of
                          the 2021–22 bowl games concluding the 2021 FBS football season. Sponsored by Vrbo, a vacation
                          rental marketplace owned by the HomeAway division of Expedia, the game was officially known as the
                          VRBO Citrus Bowl. In the first meeting between the two programs, the game featured the Kentucky
                          Wildcats of the Southeastern Conference (SEC) and the Iowa Hawkeyes of the Big Ten Conference. Both
                          teams received and accepted invitations on Sunday, December 5.[5] The Wildcats entered the Citrus
                          Bowl with a 9–3 record (5–3 SEC) and a No. 22 ranking in the final CFP poll. Kentucky made its
                          second Citrus Bowl appearance (2019). The Hawkeyes, winners of the Big Ten West Division, entered
                          the Citrus Bowl with a 10–3 record (7–2 B1G) and a No. 15 ranking in the final CFP poll. Iowa also

                          The Aggies opened the season 1-5 before closing out the year by winning six of seven to finish 7-6.
                          NMSU won a combined eight games in its previous four seasons, so Kill has executed an incredible
                          turnaround in his first year on the job. Diego Pavia was the star of the bowl win. Pavia threw for
                          167 yards and two touchdowns and added 65 rushing yards in the win. He picked up several key
                          third-down conversions with his legs in the second half to help his team secure the win. Southern

                          rushing record was 317 yards, but Gore surged past that with a 55-yard touchdown run in the final
                          minutes. Southern Miss won a combined six games in 2020 and 2021, but the bowl win over Rice gave
                          the Golden Eagles seven wins for the 2022 season. And with Gore and a significant chunk of this
                          team’s core expected to return, Southern Miss could be a team on the rise in the Sun Belt next
                          season. Eastern Michigan: With a win over San Jose State in the Potato Bowl, EMU notched its first

                          The 2022 Vrbo Citrus Bowl was a heck of a great game, with momentum swings and thrilling,
                          crunch-time drives from either team. But that matters very little to the Hawkeyes and their fans,
                          who will fly back to Iowa with a 20-17 loss to Mark Stoops and the SEC's Kentucky. The Hawkeyes had
                          their destiny in their own hands, with the ball and a timeout, starting at their 25, down 20-17,
                          with 1:48 left to win the game. And the drive started with promise. Iowa advanced to the Kentucky
                          40 with 48 seconds left. But then, Spencer Petras threw an errant pass into the diving arms of
                          DeAndre Square at the Wildcats' 26. Game over. Here's how it happened. That was just a heck of a
                          drive by Kentucky, highlighted by Wan'Dale Robinson's 52-yard catch-and-run to give him 17 catches
                          for 170 yards so far today. Chris Rodriguez Jr. finished off the eight-play, 80-yard drive with a
                          6-yard rushing score. Now, can Iowa's much-maligned offense, which has performed considerably
                          better in the second half than it did the first, win the game for this defense? Also: Tyler
                          Linderbaum is back in the game. Iowa went three-and-out. It tried to draw Kentucky offside on a
                          fourth-and-1 but it didn't work so Tory Taylor punted.

Question 4              : What position did Jason Semore hold at Valdosta State before returning to Georgia Tech?

  - Source              :
                          Semore has gone by “Boogie” ever since. It probably says something about him that he was willing to
                          embrace a nickname that wasn’t even his to begin with and given to him because it was convenient.
                          The origin story likely wouldn’t surprise Gary Goff, who was coach at Valdosta State last year when
                          he hired Semore from Tech (where he was defensive analyst) to be his defensive coordinator. The
                          Blazers reached the Division II title game, earning Goff the head job at FCS McNeese State and
                          helped bring Semore back to Tech, this time as linebackers coach. “Here’s what I love about
                          Semore,” Goff said. “He’s a great person, but he’s in this profession for the right reason, and
                          that’s to change lives through the sport. He doesn’t have an ego. It’s always the players and the
                          team first, and I really appreciate that.” His coaching acumen, his readiness and selflessness made
                          him Key’s only choice to be his new special-teams coordinator. “He’s a ball coach,” Key said. “And
                          I can’t give him any higher compliment than that.” Relying on help from fellow assistant coaches,
                          Semore taught the new punt-protection scheme on the fly, switching out seven players from the
                          former punting unit. Semore recognized that it was a highly inopportune time to change scheme,
                          given Pitt’s aggressive approach.

                          helped bring Semore back to Tech, this time as linebackers coach. “Here’s what I love about
                          Semore,” Goff said. “He’s a great person, but he’s in this profession for the right reason, and
                          that’s to change lives through the sport. He doesn’t have an ego. It’s always the players and the
                          team first, and I really appreciate that.” His coaching acumen, his readiness and selflessness made
                          him Key’s only choice to be his new special-teams coordinator. “He’s a ball coach,” Key said. “And
                          I can’t give him any higher compliment than that.” Relying on help from fellow assistant coaches,
                          Semore taught the new punt-protection scheme on the fly, switching out seven players from the
                          former punting unit. Semore recognized that it was a highly inopportune time to change scheme,

Question 5              : How many vehicles did Tesla deliver in 2021?
Correct Answers         :  
                          936,172, 936172
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prediction (only positive):
  - Answer              :  936,172
  - Threshold           : 0.8

                          Microchip shortage? What microchip shortage? EV maker Tesla, which it should be pointed out
                          produces its own chips in-house, seems not to have been bothered by supply-chain issues all that
                          much in 2021, delivering 936,172 vehicles in the year just ended, according to a report by finance
                          news outlet Finbold. That represents a healthy 87 percent increase over 2020, when the company
                          handed over 499,550 Teslas to customers. Even better for the company, it ended the year with a
                          bang, racking up a record number of sales in the last quarter of 2021, or 308,600 units. Most of
                          that total consisted of Model 3 and Model Y models, no surprise. It’s the sixth consecutive quarter
                          that it breaks its record for sales. In 2019, the automaker delivered 367,500 units, so annual
                          sales growth, while not exponential, is clearly accelerating. The company has said in the past that
                          one its main goals is to attain 50 percent sales growth year after year. Once upon a time, Tesla
                          struggled mightily to hit its delivery targets, but no more. There’s also no sign of that growth
                          slowing down any time soon, even as all-electric rivals join the market by the month. Projections
                          made by Finbold put estimated sales for 2022 at over 1.5 million units, for an increase of close to
                          65 percent. Shopicar.

                          Football League (NFL) for the 2021 season. The National Football Conference (NFC) champion Los
                          Angeles Rams defeated the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Cincinnati Bengals, 23–20.
                          The game was played on February 13, 2022, at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, the home

                          playing and winning in its home stadium.[13][14][15][16] The Rams' victory was their second, first

                          the Detroit Lions. The Bengals, who finished with a 10–7 record, were seeking their first Super
                          Bowl title following several decades of losing seasons and playoff struggles. They won their first
                          playoff game since 1990, ending the longest drought in the four major North American sports, en
                          route to their third Super Bowl appearance and first since 1988's Super Bowl XXIII.

                          Trump company.[25] The DWAC chief executive Patrick Orlando, a Florida-based financier and former

                          their primary operations in Asia."[30] An additional backer of the Trump social media venture,
                          becoming the CFO of Digital World Acquisition, was Brazilian parliamentarian Luiz Philippe of

                          a document outlining the Truth Social platform, citing a poll saying one-third of the U.S.
                          population polled had stated they would use a social media platform endorsed by Trump.[32] On

Question 9              : What won best drama at 79th Golden Globes?
Correct Answers         :  
                          The Power of the Dog
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prediction (only positive):
  - Answer              :  HBO's drama Succession
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          The 79th Golden Globe Awards honored the best in film and American television of 2021, as chosen by
                          the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA). The ceremony took place privately on January 9,
                          2022.[1] The nominees were announced on December 13, 2021, by rapper Snoop Dogg and HFPA president
                          Helen Hoehne.[1][2] For the first time since 2008, there was no traditional, televised ceremony. In
                          support of boycotts of the HFPA by various media companies, actors, and other creatives over its
                          lack of action to increase the membership diversity of the organization, the Golden Globes' regular
                          broadcaster NBC declined to televise the 79th Golden Globe Awards. The HFPA ultimately chose to
                          hold the presentation privately, with attendance limited to the organization's beneficiaries, and
                          results announced via press release and highlighted on the Golden Globe Awards' social media pages.
                          The films Belfast and The Power of the Dog were tied for the most nominations, at seven each. The
                          latter tied with Steven Spielberg's West Side Story and HBO's drama Succession with the most awards
                          of the night, with three each. These included the awards for Best Drama Film, Best Musical or
                          Comedy Film and Best Drama Series, respectively.

  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          On Tuesday night, the Golden Globes were held for the 80th time in history, though this year's
                          ceremony was notable for a bigger reason. The awards show that is supposed to honor excellence in
                          film and TV has been trying to recover from a racial exclusion scandal after a 2021 Los Angeles
                          Times story revealed that none of the 87 Hollywood Foreign Press members was Black. Tom Cruise
                          subsequently gave back his Globes, NBC opted not to air the ceremony last year, and reform in the
                          form of inclusivity began to take shape. After Jerrod Carmichael explained to the audience at the
                          Beverly Hilton how he wound up as the host (spoiler: "I'm here because I'm Black," he quipped
                          before launching into a detailed and honest account of his decision-making process), the trophy
                          distribution began. The Banshees of Inisherin, which led all movies with eight nominations, struck
                          up a meaningful friendship with Globes voters over the evening: The Irish-island-set tragicomedy
                          took home the best comedy film trophy, while Colin Farrell triumphed in the acting category and
                          writer-director Martin McDonagh won for best screenplay. The Fablemans also came into frame by
                          winning best drama film honors and best director (Steven Spielberg). Meanwhile, Everything
                          Everywhere All at Once prevailed in two dimensions, as Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan netted acting
                          trophies.

  - Source              :
                          On the TV side, ABC comedy Abbott Elementary — which boasted the most nominations of any show with
                          five — built off of its Emmy momentum and went to the head of the class, winning best comedy honors
                          and Golden Globes for Quinta Brunson and Tyler James Williams. An even bigger Emmy magnet, HBO's
                          The White Lotus, enjoyed the privilege of converting its four nominations into two awards, one for
                          best limited series and another for Jennifer Coolidge (who also delivered the funniest speech of
                          the night). And then Game of Thrones prequel House of the Dragon added some surprise to the night
                          by claiming the best drama award. Elsewhere, Tár's Cate Blanchett, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever's
                          Angela Bassett, and Elvis' Austin Butler scored trophies, along with The Bear's Jeremy Allen White,
                          Euphoria's Zendaya, and Yellowstone's Kevin Costner. In addition, Murphys were honored: Five-time
                          Globe winner Ryan Murphy was given the Carol Burnett Award and Eddie Murphy was handed the Cecil B.
                          DeMille Award. Find out who else had a Golden night by checking out our complete list of winners.

                          The snow season lasted for five months from November, during which Chongli has hosted thirty-six
                          competitions and activities, such as Far East Cup and Children Skiing International Festival. A
                          total of twenty-three skiing camps have also been set up, attracting the participation of 3,800
                          youths. All the venues construction started in November 2016 and was finished by the end of 2020 to
                          enable the city to hold test events.[30][needs update] The design for the Games' medals was
                          unveiled on 26 October 2021. The concept is based on the 2008 Summer Olympics medals and Chinese
                          astronomy and astrology as the games were held coinciding with the Chinese New Year

                          billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard — the biggest deal of its kind the gaming industry has
                          ever seen. Amid concerns about its effect on competition in the industry — particularly in the
                          nascent cloud gaming market — and in the face of ardent lobbying against the deal by competitor
                          Sony, the U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority first decided to block the acquisition, then
                          agreed to further talks with Microsoft and Activision. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has
                          withdrawn its attempt block the deal legally after a federal judge ruled in favor of Microsoft
                          being allowed to close the deal. The European Union, meanwhile, has given the deal its seal of
                          approval. Here’s the latest on Microsoft’s plans to snap up Activision Blizzard. According to
                          Reuters and Bloomberg, the Federal Trade Commission has withdrawn its administrative case against
                          Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard, which was due to go before an in-house judge in
                          August. Microsoft and Activision had requested the case be withdrawn after the FTC lost its case
                          arguing for a block on the deal in district court, and was denied an extension of a temporary block
                          by an appeals court. The move means Microsoft and Activision can now try to persuade the U.S.
                          antitrust regulator to accept a settlement.

                          A federal judge has handed Microsoft a major victory by declining to block its looming $69 billion
                          takeover of video game company Activision Blizzard. Regulators are seeking to ax the deal because
                          they say it will hurt competition. U.S. District Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley said in a ruling
                          that the “FTC has not shown a likelihood it will prevail on its claim this particular vertical
                          merger in this specific industry may substantially lessen competition. To the contrary, the record
                          evidence points to more consumer access to Call of Duty and other Activision content.” Microsoft
                          appeared to have the upper hand in a 5-day San Francisco court hearing that ended late last month.
                          The proceeding showcased testimony by Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella and longtime
                          Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick, who both pledged to keep Activision’s blockbuster game Call

                          5% on the ruling.

                          30-second spot. The Super Bowl regularly ranks as the most-watched event in the United States
                          year-to-year, which means the channel hosting the contest gets to charge a premium for advertising.
                          And if this year’s host was worried that businesses still suffered lingering effects from pandemic
                          lockdowns and a shrinking economy, those worries have evaporated: NBC sold out all of its Super

                          Google’s augmented reality eyewear is coming to disrupt your face and your business model. If you
                          don’t even have to pull your phone out to take a photo, get directions, or message with friends,
                          why would you need to buy the latest iPhone or spend so much time on Facebook? It could be a year
                          before Google eyewear reaches stores, but that’s why these and other tech companies need to
                          strategize now. If they wait to see if the device is a hit, the world could be seeing through
                          Google-tinted glasses by the time they adapt. Apple and Facebook’s bet might be to team up… If you
                          haven’t heard, Google today announced it is beginning public tests of augmented reality glasses
                          with the codename Project Glass. A mouthwatering mock-up video of what the device might eventually
                          be capable of shows someone using voice commands to send messages, take photos, share to Google+,
                          see the locations of friends, view maps, get directions, set calendar reminders, and more. Cramming
                          all the functionality into a sleek set of glasses is going to take time and effort, but the
                          Google(x) skunklabs is on it. There’s a dozen ways the product could flop, most obviously if the
                          glasses are awkward and unstylish, but also if they’re too heavy, expensive, fragile, or the world
                          is just not quite ready. Let’s forget those for a second.

                          Meta Today we’re introducing the AI Research SuperCluster (RSC), which we believe is among the
                          fastest AI supercomputers running today and will be the fastest in the world once fully built out
                          in mid-2022. AI can currently perform tasks like translating text between languages and helping
                          identify potentially harmful content, but developing the next generation of AI will require
                          powerful supercomputers capable of quintillions of operations per second. RSC will help Meta’s AI
                          researchers build better AI models that can learn from trillions of examples; work across hundreds
                          of different languages; seamlessly analyze text, images and video together; develop new augmented
                          reality tools and more. Ultimately, the work done with RSC will pave the way toward building
                          technologies for the next major computing platform — the metaverse, where AI-driven applications
                          and products will play an important role. Since 2013, we have been making significant strides in
                          AI, including self-supervised learning, where algorithms can learn from vast numbers of unlabeled
                          examples and transformers, which allow AI models to reason more effectively by focusing on certain
                          areas of their input. To fully realize the benefits of advanced AI, various domains, whether
                          vision, speech, language, will require training increasingly large and complex models, especially
                          for critical use cases like identifying harmful content. In early 2020, we decided the best way to
                          accelerate progress was to design a new computing infrastructure — RSC.

                          Meta pulled the plug on a large-scale rollout of the custom chip, which was planned for 2022, and
                          instead placed orders for billions of dollars’ worth of Nvidia GPUs that required major redesigns
                          of several of its data centers. In an effort to turn things around, Meta made plans to start
                          developing a more ambitious in-house chip, due out in 2025, capable of both training AI models and
                          running them. And that was the main topic of today’s presentation. Meta calls the new chip the Meta
                          Training and Inference Accelerator, or MTIA for short, and describes it as a part of a “family” of
                          chips for accelerating AI training and inferencing workloads. (“Inferencing” refers to running a
                          trained model.) The MTIA is an ASIC, a kind of chip that combines different circuits on one board,
                          allowing it to be programmed to carry out one or many tasks in parallel. An AI chip Meta

                          of different languages; seamlessly analyze text, images and video together; develop new augmented
                          reality tools and more. Ultimately, the work done with RSC will pave the way toward building
                          technologies for the next major computing platform — the metaverse, where AI-driven applications
                          and products will play an important role. Since 2013, we have been making significant strides in
                          AI, including self-supervised learning, where algorithms can learn from vast numbers of unlabeled
                          examples and transformers, which allow AI models to reason more effectively by focusing on certain
                          areas of their input. To fully realize the benefits of advanced AI, various domains, whether
                          vision, speech, language, will require training increasingly large and complex models, especially
                          for critical use cases like identifying harmful content. In early 2020, we decided the best way to
                          accelerate progress was to design a new computing infrastructure — RSC.

                          Board New York — College Board announced today that the SAT® Suite of Assessments will be delivered
                          digitally. In November 2021, College Board piloted the digital SAT in the U.S. and internationally;
                          80% of students responded that they found it to be less stressful and 100% of educators reported
                          having a positive experience. While the transition to digital will bring a number of student- and
                          educator-friendly changes, many important features of the SAT Suite (SAT, PSAT/NMSQT®, PSAT™ 10,
                          PSAT™ 8/9) will stay the same. The SAT Suite will continue to measure the knowledge and skills that
                          students are learning in high school and that matter most for college and career readiness. The SAT
                          will still be scored on a 1600 scale, and educators and students can continue to track growth
                          across the SAT Suite of Assessments over time. The assessments will continue to be administered in
                          a school or in a test center with a proctor present—not at home. Students will still have access to
                          free practice resources on Khan Academy. And students taking the SAT Suite will continue to connect
                          to scholarships and the College Board National Recognition Programs.

                          Super Bowl 56 is now the only game left in the 2022 NFL playoffs. The AFC and NFC champions have
                          been crowned, and the Bengals will now face the Rams to determine the NFL champion for the 2021 NFL
                          season. The 2022 NFL playoffs proved as unpredictable as the regular season. Wild-card weekend
                          largely went as expected, but after that, chaos reigned. Both of the No. 1 seeds, the Packers and
                          Titans, lost their first game in the divisional round, as all but one of the underdogs won
                          outright. The lone exception was the favored Chiefs, who mounted a game-tying drive with 13 seconds
                          left before winning in overtime. The conference championship games were wild in their own right.
                          Both the Bengals and Rams trailed by double digits in the second half of their wins over the Chiefs
                          and 49ers. They mounted comebacks and as a result, the Bengals will have a chance to win their
                          first Super Bowl in franchise history in their first appearance since 1989. Meanwhile, the Rams
                          will have a chance to avenge their loss against the Patriots in the big game just three years ago.
                          As unpredictable as the playoffs have been, the Super Bowl broadcast, location and date are set in
                          stone. Here's everything you need to know about the big game in 2022, including when Super Bowl 56

                          Lost Ark was fully released in South Korea on December 4, 2019, and in North American, South
                          American, and European regions on February 11, 2022, with Amazon Games serving as the global
                          publisher.[16] Users that pre-purchased one of four founder's packs could play 3 days early on
                          February 8, 2022.[17][18][19][20] The game was initially unavailable in Belgium and the Netherlands
                          due to the countries' stringent loot box regulations,[21] with the latter later reversing its
                          decision.[22] Within twenty-four hours of its release, Lost Ark became the second most played game
                          on Steam.[23][24] In 2021, there were plans between Smilegate and game publisher HappyTuk [zh] to
                          launch Lost Ark in Taiwan.[25] It was announced in 2023 that the release of Taiwanese servers has
                          been delayed but not canceled.[26] Lost Ark received "generally favorable" reviews according to
                          review aggregator Metacritic.[27] PC Magazine praised Lost Ark's combat, writing, "Abilities look
                          good, sound sufficiently powerful, and feel great to use. You can’t help but feel like a combat god
                          when you divekick a crowd, and blast fodder monsters into bloody chunks.

                          once it leaves Early Access and becomes a publically available free-to-play title? Well, the good
                          news is that you’ll soon have a chance to do just that. Ad Ad – content continues below Lost Ark is
                          set to be publically released via Steam as a free-to-play title on February 11th. You can pre-load
                          the game via that platform starting right now (its download size checks in at about 70 GB), but
                          unless you’re willing to buy a Founder’s Pack between now and then, you will need to wait for the
                          title to be fully unlocked before you’ll be able to launch it. As for the release time…well, that’s
                          a little tricky. Ideally, the free-to-play version of Lost Ark will launch via Steam on February 11
                          at the following times: 9 AM PST 12 PM EST5 PM GMT6 PM CETThe reason I say “ideally” in regards to
                          Lost Ark‘s free-to-play launch time is that we already saw players struggle to join Lost Ark in
                          time for its exact Early Access debut. Between congested servers and a few technical issues, many
                          fans found themselves waiting at least a little longer to actually start playing the MMO. Given
                          that the game is being opened up to a significantly larger player base on Friday, it’s likely that
                          you’ll have to navigate similar server issues at that time.

                          Update 2/16/2022: Amazon Games and Smilegate have announced some updated numbers for Lost Ark's big
                          opening weekend, including a peak of over 1.2 million concurrent viewers on Twitch and over 59.9
                          million hours watched cumulatively during launch week. Additionally, in the first three days of its
                          launch, Lost Ark gained over 4.7 million new registered players in the West. Original story:
                          Following its official free-to-play launch on February 11, Lost Ark has already become Steam's
                          second most-played game of all time by concurrent players with an all-time peak of 1,325,305
                          people. As revealed by SteamDB, Lost Ark passed Counter-Strike: Global Offensive's all-time peak of
                          1,308,963 players to secure the #2 spot. Considering these all-time peaks tend to happen around a
                          game's release, it may be quite an uphill battle to take down PUBG's record of 3,257,248 players at
                          one time. That aside, it's an impressive feat for the MMO that is developed by Smilegate and Tripod
                          Studio and published by Amazon Game Studios. This accomplishment shouldn't come as too much of a
                          surprise as Lost Ark had already become one of Steam's biggest-ever games before it even went

                          The show centered on a professional thief named Mickey O’Neil (played by the dashing Dougray
                          Scott), the man who was orchestrating probably one of the biggest heists that Los Angeles – and
                          maybe even the world – had ever seen. Mickey put together a handpicked team of experts to
                          simultaneously rob three big jewelry stores along Rodeo Drive during the Academy Awards when
                          everyone was too distracted by the glitz and glamor of Hollywood’s elite to notice the elaborate
                          heist unfold. NBC’s newest foray into the heist TV drama genre is The Endgame which just recently
                          premiered on the network. Starring Morena Baccarin and Ryan Michelle Bathé, The Endgame follows
                          Elena Federova, an international arms dealer and criminal mastermind who was recently captured by
                          the FBI. Elena has orchestrated a number of bank heists all across New York and nobody knows why.
                          But FBI agent Val Turner gets put on the case and might just be able to foil Elena’s ambitious plan
                          and discover what her endgame is. The only thing better than watching a heist unfold on a scripted
                          TV show is watching it unfold knowing it’s completely based on real-life events. That’s exactly the
                          case with ITV’s four-part miniseries titled Hatton Garden (also known as The Heist at Hatton
                          Garden), which is based on the real-life burglary of a safety deposit vault in the eponymous Hatton
                          Garden, London.

                          Those who enjoy the cat and mouse thriller The Endgame will be glad to know that there are a number
                          of other similar television shows. The thriller genre is one that has been experiencing a bit of a
                          golden age, and it seems that almost every network wants to have one of its own. It’s actually easy

                          The Best Re-Watch Value More than almost any other genre, it aims to keep the audience on the edge

                          will ultimately be resolved. The Endgame is the newest thriller to grace NBC, and it joins a large
                          number of similar series, both on that network and elsewhere. There is much about The Blacklist
                          that will appeal to those who also enjoyed The Endgame. Most notably, there is the central conflict
                          between its two main characters, Raymond Reddington and Elizabeth Keene. It’s a densely woven
                          series, with a number of enigmas and mysteries that it constantly keeps in the air. There’s no
                          denying, though, that a major part of its appeal stems from James Spader’s scenery-chewing
                          performance as the enigmatic yet compelling Reddington, and it remains one of his best roles.
                          American popular culture has an enduring fascination with the figure of the drug lord, and there
                          are few drug lords who are as renowned as Pablo Escobar.

                          "Nazism is Russia-phobia to them. So the Ukrainians are Nazis because they're anti-Russian." Putin
                          also promotes this Nazi idea to win support in the West, where people have always been
                          "susceptible" to the argument that Ukraine has a Nazi problem, Hall said. He said Putin's strategy
                          is partly "throw things at the wall and see what sticks." According to Graham, there is no evidence
                          that Putin was under public pressure to invade Ukraine, which suggests at least some of his
                          reasoning was personal. All three experts said Putin's desire to be revered in history books likely
                          motivated him to attack. Hall said Putin's anxiety is around "am I going to be a footnote in
                          Russian history or are they going to write books about me like they do Peter the Great, Catherine
                          the Great, Stalin." Taylor agrees, saying that Putin sees himself as "a great historic Russian
                          leader restoring Russian lands, and he was thinking about his legacy as he turned 70." "What have
                          the great Czars done? They've expanded Russian territory," Graham said. Even with all of the above,
                          why the invasion happened when it did is an intriguing question. Experts pointed to multiple
                          reasons why Russia invaded in February 2022. One was the arrival of Zelenskyy, who came to power in
                          2019 after a career as a comedian and actor. Putin believed that in Zelenskyy "he had someone he
                          could manipulate in Ukraine," Hall said.

                          Witcher 3, and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild as design influences for Elden Ring. He also
                          credited the table-top RPG RuneQuest, and the novels The Lord of the Rings and The Eternal Champion
                          as inspirations for the game's story.[34][35] Tsukasa Saitoh, Shoi Miyazawa, Tai Tomisawa, Yuka
                          Kitamura, and Yoshimi Kudo composed Elden Ring's original soundtrack.[36] Elden Ring was revealed
                          during an Xbox games conference at E3 2019.[37][38] Some information about the game had previously
                          been leaked online due to a vulnerability of the servers at Bandai Namco Entertainment.[39] Elden
                          Ring was widely anticipated on announcement but no further material was released until a trailer
                          was shown in June 2021.

                          Filed under: FromSoftware and George R.R. Martin’s long-awaited game arrives in 2022 Elden Ring,
                          the long-awaited new game from Dark Souls developer FromSoftware, has finally come out of hiding.
                          Publisher Bandai Namco gave fans a new look at the epic fantasy role-playing game during Thursday’s
                          Summer Game Fest Kickoff Live stream. The new trailer for Elden Ring showed gameplay for the first
                          time, gameplay that will look very familiar to fans of Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and Sekiro: Shadows
                          Die Twice. We also got a release date — Jan. 21, 2022 — and platforms. Elden Ring is coming to
                          current-gen and last-gen consoles, as well as PC. Elden Ring appears to have many elements familiar
                          to Dark Souls players: swords and sorcery, summonable allies, and giant mythical monsters to
                          battle. But it also has something fans of FromSoftware aren’t accustomed to: horses! Check out new
                          4K images of Elden Ring in the gallery below. The last time we heard anything about Elden Ring was
                          in June 2019, when Bandai Namco and FromSoftware officially revealed the game.

Question 30              : Who did Iga Swiatek defeat to win the Qatar Open 2022?
Correct Answers         :  
                          Anett Kontaveit

                          11] As of January 2022, Świątek has reached the second week of a Grand Slam at six consecutive
                          majors, beginning with her 2020 French Open title, setting a record for the longest streak of
                          second-week progressions.[12] In the quarterfinal she defeated Kaia Kanepi in a match at three
                          hours and one minute before losing to Danielle Collins in the semifinal the following day.[13][14]
                          In February, Świątek entered into the Qatar Open, where she was seeded seventh. She defeated
                          Viktorija Golubic and Daria Kasatkina in the second and third rounds, respectively. In the
                          quarterfinals, she defeated top seeded Aryna Sabalenka before advancing to the semifinals where she
                          played against Maria Sakkari, winning in straight sets. In the final, she won against fourth-seeded
                          Anett Kontaveit, losing only two games, to claim her second WTA 1000 championship title.[15] At
                          Indian Wells, Świątek reached her third WTA 1000 final, where, as the third seed, she defeated
                          Anhelina Kalinina, Clara Tauson and Angelique Kerber in three sets, and Madison Keys and Simona
                          Halep, in straight sets. She defeated sixth seed Maria Sakkari, in straight sets, to win her fifth
                          title. With the back-to-back Masters wins, Świątek reached a career-high ranking of world No. 2.[16]

                          The second set was entirely different from the first. While Jabeur again didn't win a game until
                          Swiatek was up 3-0, she finally found her gear. Her excellent slice finally began to appear and she
                          began going to the net more, helping her win four of the next five games. Swiatek appeared to have
                          finally wrestled the momentum of the match back to her side, breaking a 5-5 tie to get within one
                          game of the title, but she couldn't close and Jabeur tied it up once again. The tiebreak was close,
                          and it looked like Jabeur could run away with it at any moment, but an unforced error from Jabeur
                          ended the tiebreak and gave Swiatek her first US Open championship and her third career Grand Slam
                          trophy. When it was all over, Swiatek and Jabeur shared a heartfelt embrace, and then Swiatek
                          immediately burst into happy tears. She'd earned it. This victory puts an exclamation point on the
                          best year of Swiatek's young career — or the best year of anyone’s career, really. She started 2022
                          by falling just short of the finals at the Australian Open (she was knocked out in the semis by
                          Danielle Collins), but she rebounded to produce one of the most dominant stretches of tennis we’ve
                          seen in decades. Swiatek beat Annet Kontaveit to win the Qatar Open.

                          The 2022 Winter Olympics, officially known as the XXIV Olympic Winter Games, was a winter
                          multi-sport event held in Beijing, China, from 4 to 20 February. A total of 2,871 athletes from 91
                          nations participated in 109 events in seven sports across 15 disciplines.[1][2] Overall 29 nations
                          received at least one medal, and 23 of them won at least one gold medal. Athletes from Norway won
                          the most medals overall, with 37, and the most gold medals, with 16. The latter record was the
                          highest gold medal tally at a single Winter Games.[3] Host nation China won nine gold medals
                          surpassing its gold medal tally of five during the 2010 winter edition.[4] Athletes from that
                          nation also won 15 medals overall, which eclipsed its record of 11 at both the 2006 and 2010 winter

                          and cross-country skier Alexander Bolshunov won the most total medals at the games with five
                          each.[6] Bø also earned the most gold medals with four.[7] Snowboarder Zoi Sadowski-Synnott of New
                          Zealand won the first Winter Olympic gold medal for that nation.

                          When the CMA Awards celebrated their inaugural year in 1967, two of the most coveted awards of the
                          night were Male and Female Vocalist of the Year. Nearly 55 years later, that sentiment has not
                          changed. Awarded to artists who have had an exemplary prior year, the awards for Male and Female
                          Vocalist of the Year are honors to receive, not just in recognition of a single musical work, but
                          in recognition of a year spent contributing to the country music genre as a whole. George Strait,
                          Vince Gill and Blake Shelton are all currently tied for the most Male Vocalist of the Year wins
                          (they each have five), while Miranda Lambert has cleaned up in the Female Vocalist of the Year
                          category, with a record-setting seven awards. Other repeat Male and Female Vocalist of the Year
                          winners include Keith Urban, Brad Paisley and Ronnie Milsap, all of whom have three, as well as
                          Carrie Underwood and Loretta Lynn, who have five wins apiece. And while it may be surprising that
                          big names such as Willie Nelson and Garth Brooks have never taken home the honor, it may be even
                          more surprising to find that Olivia Newton-John has! She won in 1974 and remains the only
                          non-American Female Vocalist of the Year winner in CMA Awards history.

                          By Jonas Pope IV The suspense surrounding the rare UNC-N.C. State ACC baseball title game matchup
                          ended when Vance Honeycutt’s first home run landed on West 4th Street. When his second home run
                          landed in almost the same spot, it was celebration time for the Tar Heels, sadness for the
                          Wolfpack. North Carolina defeated N.C. State, 9-5, to win the 2022 ACC tournament title Sunday, the
                          eighth title in school history and first for the Tar Heels since 2019. Carolina won three straight
                          ACC tournament titles from 1982-84 and won it again in 1990 before adding championships in 2007 and
                          2019. Scott Forbes, the Tar Heels’ second-year skipper, won a championship in his first attempt.
                          The title still eludes N.C. State head coach Elliott Avent, in his 26th season. “ACC champs,”
                          Forbes said, tossing his hands in the air. “Our whole approach was we wanted to win an ACC
                          championship for the University of North Carolina, we just happened to be playing N.C. State.” N.C.
                          State hasn’t won an ACC title since 1992. They are 0-8 in title games since then. Sunday’s showdown
                          was the first time since 1990 that the Tar Heels and Wolfpack played in a title game. Carolina won
                          that contest, 5-0.

                          iPhone 14 and October 7 for the iPhone 14 Plus.[22] The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus have an
                          identical design to the iPhone 13, although the US models lack a physical SIM tray. The iPhone 14
                          and iPhone 14 Plus are available in six colors: Blue, Purple, Midnight, Starlight, Yellow, and
                          Product Red.[24] Purple is a new color replacing Pink used on the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini. The
                          yellow option was added on March 7, 2023.[25] iPhone 14 and 14 Plus are available in three internal
                          storage configurations: 128, 256, and 512 GB. Both models have 6 GB of RAM, an increase over the

                          rating for dust and water resistance as their predecessors.[6] The iPhone 14 and 14 Plus use a
                          5-nanometer Apple-designed system on a chip, the A15 Bionic, while the iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max
                          have a faster A16 Bionic.[26][27] The iPhone 14's A15 chip has a 6-core CPU, 5-core GPU, and a
                          16-core Neural Engine.

                          will kick off with Sundar Pichai’s “Google I/O keynote” at 10 AM. This will be the main attraction
                          for the general population as the main event tends to be more consumer-focused. While the event’s
                          description doesn’t provide specifics, expect to see announcements for popular Google services,
                          Workspace, privacy, health, and Google’s other new projects and endeavors. Also, keep an eye out

                          superhero cinematic universe. The “Anchorman” and “Big Short” director will be working with Tommy
                          Wirkola (“Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters”), who is writing the screenplay. In the comics,
                          “Irredeemable” follows superhero-turned-villain, the Plutonian, as he goes on a killing rampage.
                          It’s up to the superhero group The Paradigm to stop him.

                          was highly acclaimed and absolutely stole the spotlight. In The Lost City, Bowen Yang has a small
                          role as Ray, the moderator of Loretta Sage's press conference. In recent years, Yang gained
                          notoriety for his appearances on Saturday Night Live, Girls5Eva and the rom-coms Fire Island and
                          Bros. However, a little-known fact about this actor and writer is that his career could have gone
                          in a completely different direction: when he was younger, Bowen enrolled at New York University to
                          study chemistry, intending to become a doctor inspired by his favorite fictional character:
                          Cristina Yang from Grey's Anatomy. But as years went by, he came to realize that he was influenced
                          not by Cristina, but by Sandra Oh, the actress who portrayed her, and eventually discovered that
                          acting was his true passion.

Question 42              : When did Apple M2 chip?

                          When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it
                          works. The M2 chip is here, ushering in the second generation of Apple's bespoke silicon The Apple
                          M2 chip was unveiled at Apple's WWDC 2022 keynote on June 6, and it's the inaugural chip in Apple's
                          second generation of bespoke silicon. This is significant because the M2 is an evolution of the
                          remarkable M1 chip that debuted in 2020, and it powers Apple's new 13-inch MacBook Air 2022 and
                          MacBook Pro 2022. These are successors to two of the best MacBooks on the market, so it's exciting
                          to see what an M2 injection can do. The new Apple M2 chip debuted in two new laptops: the 13-inch
                          MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, which launched in the Summer of 2022. The M2 chip is available in
                          either the 13-inch MacBook Air 2022 (starting price: $1,199) or the MacBook Pro 2022 ($1,299), so
                          you'll need to pay over $1k to get yourself an M2-powered MacBook. It's also available in the Mac
                          mini M2, a cheaper and more powerful version of Apple's pint-sized Mac. Apple's new M2 chip is
                          configurable with an 8-core CPU and up to a 10-core GPU.

  - Source              :
                          Apple in June 2022 unveiled the M2, its next-generation Apple silicon chip that followed the M1
                          chip. This guide highlights everything you need to know about the M2 chip, from performance
                          improvements to extra features. The M2 is Apple's next-generation System on a Chip (SoC) developed
                          for use in Macs and iPads. It marks Apple's continued work to transition away from the Intel chips
                          that were used in Macs up until 2020. As a "System on a Chip," the M2 integrates several different
                          components, including the CPU, GPU, unified memory architecture (RAM), Neural Engine, Secure
                          Enclave, SSD controller, image signal processor, encode/decode engines, Thunderbolt controller with
                          USB 4 support, and more, all of which power the different features in the Mac. Before Apple
                          silicon, Macs used multiple chips for CPU, I/O, and security, but Apple's effort to integrate these
                          chips is the reason why the M2 is much faster and more efficient than Intel chips. The unified
                          memory architecture that Apple has included is also a major factor because all of the technologies
                          in the M2 are able to access the same data without having to swap between multiple pools of memory.
                          Built into the M2 chip, the unified memory architecture means the CPU, GPU, and other processor
                          components don't need to copy data between one another, and are able to access the same data pool.

                          the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro with M2 Pro and M2 Max chips. Battery life is longer. Prices
                          for the 14-inch model still start at $1,999 in the U.S. where in the U.K. the price is up from
                          £1,899 to £2,149. The entry level 14-inch model offers a 10-Core CPU and 16-Core GPU and 16GB
                          memory. While the maximum M2 Max offers 12-Core CPU, 30-Core GPU and up to 96GB of unified memory.
                          The new models include support for Wi-Fi 6E, advanced HDMI, that supports 8K displays for the first

                          and accommodations for disabilities, the Academy offered a live feed of American Sign Language
                          (ASL) interpretation for the ceremony through the Academy Awards' YouTube channel.[40] In June
                          2020, the Academy announced that, starting with the 94th awards, a fixed number of ten films would
                          once again be nominated for Best Picture.[41] According to The Hollywood Reporter, this rule change
                          was initiated in order "to maximize the diversity of the films that are nominated for the Academy's
                          highest honor" as part of the organization's Academy Aperture 2025 equity and inclusion
                          initiative.[42] Previously, AMPAS had experimented with a ten-film Best Picture slate for two years
                          beginning with the 82nd ceremony in 2010 before changing the rules two years later so that a
                          fluctuating number of films would be nominated depending on the nomination voting results.[43]

                          Yes, a big win here for 19-year-old Olivia Rodrigo would be a win for vivid teenage emotions
                          rendered in attentive melodic detail. But it would also be a para-victory for Eilish (who swept the
                          top four Grammy categories in 2020) and Swift (a three-time album of the year winner), as well as a
                          potential embarrassment for the Recording Academy, which too often reduces artists to types — in
                          this case, the precocious songwriter-dynamo type whose hit singles live at the top of the charts.
                          For Rodrigo, that hit was “Drivers License,” a power ballad fueled by adolescent confusion and the
                          desire to accelerate into an unwritten future. If Rodrigo takes home the night’s biggest trophy, it
                          should be for her musical imagination, not the Grammy electorate’s lack of one. Unfettered thoughts
                          that appeared in the mind of a 42-year-old White man upon hearing the debut full-length from Lil
                          Nas X, a 22-year-old Black man, the day it dropped, Sept. 17, 2021: Why isn’t this weird? Why make
                          such freaky-deaky music videos for such normy sounding pop songs? Does Lil Nas X want to be normal?
                          I grew up being made to feel I was normal, which made me want to be weird, made me want to get
                          weird haircuts, like weird music and have a bad attitude about all of it without anyone giving me
                          too much of a hard time.

                          2022. Investors were rattled by the rebates, sending the stock plunging 37% in December alone.
                          Tesla thanked customers and employees for helping the company “achieve a great 2022 in light of
                          significant Covid and supply chain related challenges throughout the year,” according to a
                          statement released on Monday. The company also said it was proud of its growth and progress. “We
                          continued to transition towards a more even regional mix of vehicle builds which again led to a
                          further increase in cars in transit at the end of the quarter,” the statement read. Tesla said it
                          delivered 1.25 million of its less-expensive Model 3 and Model Y electric cars, and nearly 67,000
                          of its higher-end Model X and Model X lines. Most stock quote data provided by BATS. US market

                          completed his acquisition of Twitter last month — layoffs of thousands of employees, firings of
                          engineers critical of him and an impersonation of an official Eli Lilly account that caused the
                          pharmaceutical company's stock to drop. It's all part of the chaotic saga that began this spring,
                          when Musk first put in motion a plan to take control of the social media platform. Here’s a
                          complete timeline of what’s happened so far. On April 5, Musk discloses he has purchased more than
                          9% of Twitter's shares on the open market. At first, he is offered a board seat. That plan quickly
                          falls through — and Twitter decides to adopt a poison-pill strategy to fend off a hostile takeover
                          from Musk. Musk subsequently makes an offer to buy Twitter for $54.20 a share, or about $44 billion
                          — a price well above the company's stock price at the time. He says his goal is to apply free
                          speech principles to the platform, which he claimed had been mismanaged. "The company will neither
                          thrive nor serve this societal imperative in its current form," he writes. "Twitter needs to be
                          transformed as a private company." "Twitter has extraordinary potential. I will unlock it," he
                          adds. Musk says he would fund the deal through a combination of cash and borrowing.

                          At least one of the executives who was fired was escorted out of Twitter’s office, they said. Mr.
                          Musk, who is one of Twitter’s most active users and has more than 109 million followers, began
                          accumulating shares in the company this year. In April, he struck the deal to buy the company for
                          $44 billion and said he would lift Twitter’s content moderation policies, eliminate spam, add new
                          features and provide more transparency about the algorithms used to promote content. “Twitter has
                          tremendous potential — I look forward to working with the company and the community of users to
                          unlock it,” he said in a statement in April. But, within weeks, he began questioning the deal. Mr.
                          Musk lashed out at the Twitter executives responsible for content decisions and accused the company
                          of failing to accurately count the spam accounts on its platform. When Parag Agrawal, Twitter’s
                          chief executive, tried debunking Mr. Musk’s claims, Mr. Musk responded by tweeting a poop emoji. By
                          July, Mr. Musk had decided that he no longer wanted to own Twitter, arguing that he had been misled
                          about the amount of spam on the platform. He announced his intent to abandon the acquisition.
                          Twitter sued Mr. Musk to force him to carry out the agreement. The company accused Mr. Musk of
                          trying to back out of the deal because the economic downturn had caused a decline in his personal
                          wealth. Mr. Musk had agreed to personally provide roughly $33 billion of the $44 billion deal.

  - Source              :
                          Business magnate Elon Musk initiated an acquisition of American social media company Twitter, Inc.
                          on April 14, 2022, and concluded it on October 27, 2022. Musk had begun buying shares of the
                          company in January 2022, becoming its largest shareholder by April with a 9.1 percent ownership
                          stake. Twitter invited Musk to join its board of directors, an offer he initially accepted before
                          declining. On April 14, Musk made an unsolicited offer to purchase the company, to which Twitter's
                          board initially responded with a "poison pill" strategy to resist a hostile takeover, before
                          unanimously accepting Musk's buyout offer of $44 billion on April 25. Musk stated that he planned
                          to introduce new features to the platform, make its algorithms open-source, combat spambot
                          accounts, and promote free speech. In July, Musk announced his intention to terminate the
                          agreement, asserting that Twitter had breached their agreement by refusing to crack down on spambot
                          accounts. The company filed a lawsuit against Musk in the Delaware Court of Chancery shortly
                          thereafter, with a trial scheduled for the week of October 17. Weeks before the trial was set to
                          begin, Musk reversed course, announcing that he would move forward with the acquisition. The deal
                          was closed on October 27, with Musk immediately becoming Twitter's new owner and CEO. Twitter was
                          taken private and merged into a new parent company named X Corp.

                          McIlroy posted an 8-under 64, matching the lowest Sunday round in Masters history, to take the
                          clubhouse lead at 7 under for the tournament. Smith finished 1 over for the day and 5 under for the
                          tournament. Scheffler would not be deterred. He was nails down the stretch with consecutive birdies
                          on Nos. 14-15 to push his lead to five and remove any doubt that he would claim this Masters -- and
                          the 2022 golf season -- for himself. While his confidence never wavered, nerves undoubtedly
                          affected him on the 18th green as Scheffler ran makable 7-foot par and 5-foot bogey putts past the
                          hole. Scheffler took a breath, listened to the patrons lifting him up with chants of "Sco-ttie,
                          Sco-ttie" and sank his 3-foot double bogey putt to finish 1 under for the round, 10 under for the
                          tournament and as the latest man to be sized for a green jacket in Augusta. Rick Gehman, Kyle

                          holes 10 and 11. At the par-5 13th, Im hit his approach shot to 12 feet and made the putt for eagle
                          before also birdieing the par-5 15th to take sole possession of the lead.[20][21] Cameron Smith,
                          who finished tied for second with Im in 2020, opened with a double-bogey at the first hole.
                          Beginning with a chip-in for birdie at the fifth, however, Smith went eight-under-par over a span
                          of 14 holes. At the par-3 16th, Smith hit his tee shot to five feet and made the putt to get to
                          six-under for the round before another double-bogey on the 18th dropped him back to four-under and
                          a round of 68.[22]

Question 52              : Who won the women's singles Australian Open 2022?
Correct Answers         :  
                          Ashleigh Barty
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                          The 2022 Australian Open was a Grand Slam tennis tournament that took place at Melbourne Park,
                          Australia from 17 to 30 January 2022.[2] It was the 110th edition of the Australian Open, the 54th
                          in the Open Era, and the first Grand Slam of the year. The tournament consisted of events for
                          professional players in singles, doubles and mixed doubles. Junior and wheelchair players competed
                          in singles and doubles tournaments. As in previous years, the tournament's main sponsor was Kia.
                          The men's singles title was won by Rafael Nadal, and was Nadal's 21st major title, and his second
                          Australian Open. He defeated second seed Daniil Medvedev in the final, winning in five sets after
                          being two sets down. In winning the title, Nadal broke the record for all-time men's major singles
                          title - it was previously tied at 20 between himself, Novak Djokovic, and Roger Federer. The
                          women's singles title was won by Ashleigh Barty, who won her first Australian Open title and third
                          major title. She defeated 27th seed Danielle Collins in straight sets. Barty was the first
                          Australian to win the title since Chris O'Neil won the title in 1978. The final would also prove to
                          be Barty's last professional match, with Barty announcing her retirement in March 2022.

                          first U.S. Open singles title. It is her third Grand Slam title and first on a surface other than
                          clay. By Matthew Futterman The 2022 U.S. Open will always be remembered — outside of Poland, at
                          least — for its farewell to Serena Williams, long the queen of tennis and the greatest women’s
                          player ever. Beware, though, after Poland’s Iga Swiatek won the women’s singles title Saturday,
                          beating Ons Jabeur of Tunisia Saturday afternoon at Arthur Ashe Stadium, the sport may have a new
                          ruler on its hands. Swiatek, the world No. 1, lived up to her billing and beat Jabeur, 6-2, 7-6(5),
                          to capture her first U.S. Open singles title. It was the third Grand Slam title of Swiatek’s brief
                          career and her first on a surface other than clay. When Jabeur’s last forehand sailed long, Swiatek
                          collapsed on her back after a 1 hour, 51 minute duel that got dangerously close as the afternoon
                          wore on.

                          of the guard. While Iga Swiatek entered the final with a Grand Slam title in her trophy case
                          already -- and on a 34-match winning streak -- the 21-year-old is still just coming into her own as
                          one of the world's great players. She staked a dominant claim to that as she cruised to victory
                          over Coco Gauff with a 6-1, 6-3 win in the final at Roland Garros in a match where she was almost
                          never seriously challenged. Swiatek won the fall edition of the French Open in 2020 after it was

                          basically I was living kind of in a bubble for two weeks," said Swiatek, the only Polish player to

                          This was the first Grand Slam tournament since the international governing bodies of tennis allowed
                          players from Russia and Belarus to continue to participate in tennis events, but not compete under
                          the name or flags of Russia and Belarus until further notice, due to the 2022 Russian invasion of
                          Ukraine.[3][4] The men's singles title was won for the 14th time by Rafael Nadal, who won his 22nd
                          Grand Slam title. He defeated eighth seed Casper Ruud, who was playing his first grand slam final,
                          in straight sets. In winning the title, Nadal extended his record of most titles per tournament at
                          the French Open, and also extended his all-time men's record of major singles titles to 22. The
                          women's singles title was won by Iga Świątek, who won her second French Open and second grand slam
                          title, having won her first at the 2020 French Open. She defeated 18th seed Coco Gauff, who was
                          also playing her first grand slam final, in straight sets. In winning the title, Świątek became the
                          youngest winner of multiple majors since Maria Sharapova's win at the 2006 US Open. As a Grand Slam
                          tournament, the points for the French Open are the highest of all ATP and WTA tournaments.[5] These
                          points determine the world ATP and WTA rankings for men's and women's competition, respectively.

                          The 2022 French Open was a Grand Slam tennis tournament played on outdoor clay courts. It was held
                          at the Stade Roland Garros in Paris, France, from 22 May to 5 June 2022, comprising singles,
                          doubles and mixed doubles play. Junior and wheelchair tournaments are also scheduled. Novak
                          Djokovic was the defending champion in men's singles, and Barbora Krejčíková was the defending
                          champion in the women's singles.[1] Neither successfully defended their title, with Djokovic losing
                          in the quarter-finals to Rafael Nadal, and Krejčíková losing in the first round to Diane Parry. The
                          event returned to its full spectator capacity after the last two editions due to COVID-19
                          restrictions in France. It was the 126th edition of the French Open and the second Grand Slam event
                          of 2022. The main singles draws included 16 qualifiers for men and 16 for women out of 128 players
                          in each draw. It was part of the 2022 ATP Tour and the 2022 WTA Tour. It was also the first edition
                          of the tournament to feature a super tie break in the final set where the player would win first to
                          ten points as rules are now applied in Wimbledon and US Open.[2]

                          7–6(7–3) to win the gentlemen's singles tennis title at the 2022 Wimbledon Championships. It was
                          his seventh Wimbledon title and 21st major singles title overall.[1] Djokovic became the fifth man
                          in the Open Era to record a streak of at least four consecutive titles at one major.[2] By reaching
                          his 32nd men's singles major final, he surpassed the all-time record he had jointly held with Roger
                          Federer.[3] Djokovic also became the first player (male or female) to win 80 matches at all four
                          majors with his first-round win over Kwon Soon-woo.[4] Because no ranking points were awarded for
                          the tournament in response to its banning of Russian and Belarusian players, Djokovic dropped out
                          of the top five in ATP rankings after the tournament.[5] Kyrgios became the first unseeded man to
                          reach a major final since Jo-Wilfried Tsonga at the 2008 Australian Open, the first Australian man
                          to reach a major final since Lleyton Hewitt at the 2005 Australian Open, and the first unseeded or
                          Australian man to reach the Wimbledon final since Mark Philippoussis in 2003.[6]

                          Federer.[3] Djokovic also became the first player (male or female) to win 80 matches at all four
                          majors with his first-round win over Kwon Soon-woo.[4] Because no ranking points were awarded for
                          the tournament in response to its banning of Russian and Belarusian players, Djokovic dropped out
                          of the top five in ATP rankings after the tournament.[5] Kyrgios became the first unseeded man to
                          reach a major final since Jo-Wilfried Tsonga at the 2008 Australian Open, the first Australian man
                          to reach a major final since Lleyton Hewitt at the 2005 Australian Open, and the first unseeded or
                          Australian man to reach the Wimbledon final since Mark Philippoussis in 2003.[6]

                          the French Open semifinal last month when Djokovic came out victorious in four sets. Alcaraz had
                          struggled with cramps at Roland-Garros, but the 20-year-old stayed solid at the All England Club to

                          final last year. He announced on July 2 that he was withdrawing from this year's tournament due to
                          a torn ligament in his wrist. "I tried everything to be able to play and I am disappointed to say

                          Find out how the trophy was won and all the other results from Saturday 10th September at the
                          fourth and final grand slam of the year. World No1 Iga Swiatek won the women's title at the 2022 US
                          Open tennis grand slam on Saturday (10 September), defeating Ons Jabeur 6-2, 7-6 [7-5]. With her
                          victory at Flushing Meadows in New York, the fourth and final grand slam of the year, Swiatek
                          claimed her third Grand Slam trophy after she won the 2020 and 2022 French Open. The Polish
                          superstar raced to a dominant first-set win on the hard courts of the USTA Billie Jean King
                          National Tennis Center. However, Jabeur made things complicated for the 21-year-old in a marathon
                          second set. The title, which Great Britain's Emma Raducanu won in 2021, was the first time a No1
                          seed won the US Open final since Serena Williams in 2014. The men's final takes place on Sunday as
                          Carlos Alcaraz (ESP) will take on Casper Ruud (NOR). Swiatek became the first woman to win seven
                          titles in one year since Serena Williams in 2014. "You have to be mentally strong throughout the
                          whole tournament," Swiatek told ESPN. "It wasn't easy. I know I didn't play perfectly. Sometimes
                          you have to accept that.

                          Norway's Casper Ruud in four sets to win the men's singles final at the U.S. Open, his first
                          tournament win at Flushing-Meadows. Alcaraz, 19, is the first male teenager to win a Grand Slam
                          since Rafael Nadal won the French Open in 2005. Alcaraz will now take over as world No. 1, becoming
                          the youngest player to ever be the world's top-ranked player. Alcaraz took the first set but lost
                          the second to Ruud, the No. 5 seed. Ruud led 6-5 in a marathon third set that lasted more than 70
                          minutes and ended with Alcaraz tying it up after a dramatic 15-minute game. Alcaraz then easily
                          took the tiebreaker 7-1. Alcaraz won the fourth and final set 6-3. Alcaraz won the quarter-final
                          round in five sets against American Frances Tiafoe, who had defeated Rafael Nadal. He was serenaded
                          by choruses of "Olé, Olé, Olé! Carlos!" that reverberated off the closed roof at Arthur Ashe
                          Stadium — and Alcaraz often motioned to the supportive spectators to get louder.

                          quarterfinals at all four majors since Novak Djokovic in 2008.[14] Nadal was vying for a

                          since Rafael Nadal won the French Open in 2005. Alcaraz will now take over as world No. 1, becoming
                          the youngest player to ever be the world's top-ranked player. Alcaraz took the first set but lost
                          the second to Ruud, the No. 5 seed. Ruud led 6-5 in a marathon third set that lasted more than 70
                          minutes and ended with Alcaraz tying it up after a dramatic 15-minute game. Alcaraz then easily
                          took the tiebreaker 7-1. Alcaraz won the fourth and final set 6-3. Alcaraz won the quarter-final
                          round in five sets against American Frances Tiafoe, who had defeated Rafael Nadal. He was serenaded
                          by choruses of "Olé, Olé, Olé! Carlos!" that reverberated off the closed roof at Arthur Ashe
                          Stadium — and Alcaraz often motioned to the supportive spectators to get louder.

Question 68              : Who is the new head coach of the Virginia Tech football team in 2022?
Correct Answers         :  
                          Brent Pry
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prediction (only positive):

  - Source              :
                          The starting point was the 2007-2010 recruiting runs that couldn’t net a replacement for Tyrod
                          Taylor behind center. There were flashes of good but the best post-Taylor Quarterback, Michael
                          Brewer was handicapped by injury, and a team in decline as the running game evaporated, and the
                          offensive line recruiting dropped to piecemeal replacements. Suffice it to say by the late Beamer
                          Era the team was sliding downhill rapidly. Whit Babcock, in a move that didn’t shock anyone after
                          his basketball coaching coup (of the time) with the Buzz hire, went out and found the best
                          available head coach by media and analyst agreement in Justin Fuente. We know how that turned out…
                          a brilliant 2 season flash followed by a fading ember and a huge bill for the displeasure of having
                          to part company with a failed regime. Face it, as reported third coaching choice Brent Pry signed
                          his contract to take over as head coach, the Virginia Tech Hokie football program was all show and
                          no go. Regardless of the level of Pry’s enthusiasm he was taking on a leaking hulk with a great
                          paintjob. The indications are that he knew and understood that challenge. The Hokies just haven’t
                          been very good for over a decade and getting over that slump was just not going to be a very easy
                          task, especially for a program that can only generate revenues well below even modest programs.

                          Reserve[1]) took place on Saturday, May 7, 2022, at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky. It was
                          the 148th running of the Kentucky Derby, a 1+1⁄4 miles (2.0 km) Grade I stakes race for
                          three-year-old Thoroughbreds. The Derby is held annually at Churchill Downs on the first Saturday
                          in May since its inception in 1875. The 20 horses that ran in the Derby qualified by earning points

                          horses finished behind winner Rich Strike, who had only entered the race after a late scratch.
                          Entering the race at odds of 80–1, Rich Strike's victory was the second-largest upset in Derby
                          history. It was the first Kentucky Derby victory for his trainer Eric Reed, as well as the first
                          graded stakes win in any race for his jockey Sonny Leon. Participation in the Kentucky Derby is
                          restricted to three-year-old Thoroughbreds.

                          The initial months of 2021 were not favorable for automakers. Semiconductor shortages derailed the
                          post-COVID recovery, affecting vehicle sales worldwide. But the shortages have eased a bit one year
                          later and auto sales are reviving. Automakers expect to recover the losses made during the last two
                          years, soon. However, traditional automakers are unable to cope with the rising demand for pure
                          EVs, whereas Tesla’s ability to address this demand has rewarded it not only with higher vehicle
                          sales in Q1 2022 but also a record revenue of $18.8 billion. Tesla has also started deliveries to
                          car rental service provider Hertz against its huge 100,000-vehicle order, which is also a reason
                          for high vehicle production and delivery during the quarter. Tesla’s Q1 2022 revenue would have
                          been more without the fresh COVID wave that has hit Shanghai and surrounding areas, affecting the
                          company’s production there. From the second week of March, rising cases of a new COVID variant have
                          forced automakers operating around Shanghai to suspend production. The urge to achieve L4 autonomy
                          by the end of 2023 and to roll out robotaxis by early 2025 can be a major reason for Tesla’s big
                          R&D spend. Besides, Tesla could also be conducting research on developing new battery chemistry.
                          The soaring prices of some key battery components like nickel and lithium have put the auto OEMs in
                          a spot.

                          Tesla just reported first-quarter earnings for 2022 and beat analysts' expectations on the top and
                          bottom lines. Here are the key numbers. Shares rose as high as 6% in after-hours trading.
                          Automotive revenue reached $16.86 billion, up 87% from the same period last year. Automotive gross
                          margins jumped to a record 32.9% with Tesla reporting gross profit of $5.54 billion in its main
                          segment. Regulatory credits accounted for $679 million of automotive revenue for the quarter.
                          Revenue growth was driven in part by an increase in the number of cars Tesla delivered, and an
                          increase in average sales prices, the company said in its shareholder deck.

                          STX Entertainment is an American entertainment and media company. Founded in March 2014 by film
                          producer Robert Simonds, the studio produces film, television, and digital media projects. In April
                          2020, STX announced that it would merge with the Indian studio Eros International plc. The merger
                          was completed in July 2020, and STX became a division of ErosSTX. In December 2021, Jahm Najafi
                          announced his intention to acquire STX from the merged company for $173 million–a sale completed in
                          April 2022. Eros remains a minority, non-voting shareholder.[1] In 2012, Simonds and McGlashan
                          began work on conceptualizing a media company based on the idea of producing medium-budget projects
                          with a star attached, a method that had gone out of style with Hollywood studios. The conversation
                          led to the launch of STX Entertainment in 2014, with the mission to finance, develop, produce,
                          market, and distribute star-driven content around the world.[2][3] Investors in the company
                          included Hony Capital, Tencent, PCCW, TPG Growth, and Liberty Global. Individual investors include
                          Gigi Pritzker, Beau Wrigley, and Dominic Ng.[4][5][6] In September 2017, it was reported that STX
                          was considering an initial public offering on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (SEHK).

                          This article was published more than 1 year ago Orrin G. Hatch, a conservative Utah Republican who
                          came out of political nowhere to win a U.S. Senate seat in 1976 and ended his career 42 years later
                          as the longest-serving Republican in the chamber’s history and one of his party’s most influential
                          lawmakers of recent decades, died April 23 in Salt Lake City. He was 88. The death was announced by
                          the Hatch Foundation. The cause was not immediately disclosed. Tall and slim in build and
                          impeccable in dress, Mr. Hatch had a gentlemanly demeanor but behind it wielded strong views, high
                          energy and a love for legislative give-and-take that made him a force on Capitol Hill. When he
                          retired in 2019, at the end of his seventh term, he chaired the powerful tax-writing Finance
                          Committee and by virtue of his seniority was Senate president pro tempore. By the end of his
                          tenure, Mr. Hatch had sponsored or co-sponsored 790 pieces of legislation that became law, more
                          than any other senator in office at the time, according to Library of Congress data. He achieved
                          that record in part through his willingness to work with liberal Democrats. “He was a tough
                          partisan, a solid conservative, but he could make strategic alliances to get legislation passed,”
                          former Senate historian Donald Ritchie said in an interview. “No one questioned his ideology, so he
                          could deal.

                          lucky to get you,” Mr. Colbert continued. “But you’re my friend, and I’m telling you not to go.”

                          The final death knell was a devastating 15,000-word profile in The Atlantic that published on
                          Friday. The blistering piece, in which author Tim Alberta spoke to more than 100 CNN employees,
                          called into serious question Licht’s ability to lead the organization into the future. In the wake
                          of The Atlantic article, Licht attempted to regain his footing. He apologized to staffers and vowed
                          to “fight like hell” to win over the trust of employees. But it became increasingly clear that
                          Licht’s tenure as the chief executive was not tenable and quickly coming to an end. High-profile
                          anchors and correspondents, in addition the the rank-and-file staff, had hit the wall with Licht.
                          The CNN chief had, in effect, lost the room. The picture quickly became clear to Zaslav, who
                          installed his top lieutenant, David Leavy, as CNN’s chief operating officer last week. Over the
                          weekend, after The Atlantic story crystallized concerns that Zaslav had with Licht’s leadership
                          over the last several months, the Warner Bros. Discovery chief started seriously considering
                          relieving him of his duties, a person familiar with the matter said. It had become evident that
                          Licht, suffering from a series of self-inflicted wounds, could no longer lead the company. The
                          final decision to remove Licht was ultimately made by Zaslav earlier this week, the person said.

                          Apple’s self-service repair program went live today, giving iPhone (and eventually Mac) customers
                          the tools and instructions need to repair their devices at a lower cost and from the comfort of
                          their own homes. To do so, however, you need tools—some of which are proprietary. With the “Self
                          Service Repair Store” opening today, you can now purchase those parts individually. However, doing
                          so might not be the most cost-effective method. Spending $85 on a Torque Driver or $13 on a single
                          Torx Security Bit adds significant cost to your repair, and you might only need these tools once or
                          twice. Fortunately, Apple offers a $49 (including shipping) rental kit that contains all the tools
                          and parts needed to make repairs on specific devices. Maybe too many parts, depending on which
                          repair you’re making, but there’s no way to rent individual tools a la carte. The rental lasts for
                          7 days once you’ve received the tool kit, after which you are charged “a fee and a tax” via a hold
                          on your credit card. Just be sure to stretch before you try hauling these kits to your workbench,
                          because they are hefty. As MacRumors notes, the two cases you receive with the rental kits weigh 43
                          pounds and 36 pounds, individually. When stacked, the cases measure 20 inches wide and 47 inches
                          tall. It’s safe to say that you can skip the gym on iPhone repair day.

                          pounds of repair equipment, which arrived at my door in hard plastic cases. The process was then so
                          unforgiving that I destroyed my iPhone screen in a split second with an irreversible error. The
                          catastrophe unfolded even though I called in an expert, Shakeel Taiyab, an independent phone repair
                          technician in South San Francisco, for help. After reading Apple’s manuals and trying the tools

                          Apple’s self-service repair program went live today, giving iPhone (and eventually Mac) customers
                          the tools and instructions need to repair their devices at a lower cost and from the comfort of
                          their own homes. To do so, however, you need tools—some of which are proprietary. With the “Self
                          Service Repair Store” opening today, you can now purchase those parts individually. However, doing
                          so might not be the most cost-effective method. Spending $85 on a Torque Driver or $13 on a single
                          Torx Security Bit adds significant cost to your repair, and you might only need these tools once or
                          twice. Fortunately, Apple offers a $49 (including shipping) rental kit that contains all the tools
                          and parts needed to make repairs on specific devices. Maybe too many parts, depending on which
                          repair you’re making, but there’s no way to rent individual tools a la carte. The rental lasts for
                          7 days once you’ve received the tool kit, after which you are charged “a fee and a tax” via a hold
                          on your credit card. Just be sure to stretch before you try hauling these kits to your workbench,
                          because they are hefty. As MacRumors notes, the two cases you receive with the rental kits weigh 43
                          pounds and 36 pounds, individually. When stacked, the cases measure 20 inches wide and 47 inches
                          tall. It’s safe to say that you can skip the gym on iPhone repair day.

                          The 2022 NBA playoffs was the postseason tournament of the National Basketball Association's
                          2021–22 season. The playoffs began on April 16 and ended on June 16 with the conclusion of the 2022
                          NBA Finals. The playoffs also returned to its normal April–June schedule for the first time since
                          2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in two postponements in 2020 and 2021. Eight teams from
                          each conference participated in the playoffs. The top six teams in each conference, based on
                          winning percentage, directly qualified for the playoffs; the seeding order of those teams was also
                          based on winning percentage. If two or more teams had the same record, standard NBA tiebreaker
                          rules were used. The NBA Board of Governors approved a format for the 2021–22 season to have a
                          play-in tournament involving the teams ranked 7th through 10th in each conference. The 7th place
                          team and 8th place team participated in a "double-chance" game, with the winner advancing to the
                          playoffs as the 7-seed. The loser then played the winner of the elimination game between the 9th
                          place and 10th place teams to determine the playoff's 8-seed. The NBA's regular playoff format then
                          proceeded as normal.[12] Each conference's bracket was fixed with no reseeding.

                          When news of the reality competition spin-off was announced last week, some on social media pointed
                          out the irony of such a competition show. “The game is intended to represent the commodification of
                          suffering by privileged people, and how watching people struggle for money and their lives is seen
                          as entertainment for people who will never have to experience such things,” said Mika Winder, 16,
                          of Oregon. “Making a real life version goes against the entire message of the original show in an
                          almost comical way." Others echoed similar sentiments on social media, including one person who

                          Netflix is recruiting participants for a reality TV show inspired by its most popular series of all
                          time, Squid Game. However, it will not be life or death that is at stake, as depicted in the South
                          Korean dystopian drama. Instead, 456 recruits from around the world will play games where "the
                          worst fate is going home empty-handed" - missing out on a $4.56m (£3.8m) prize. Netflix also
                          confirmed that the popular series would be renewed for a second season earlier this week. On
                          Wednesday, the platform announced that its new 10-episode series - Squid Game: The Challenge -
                          would offer the "largest cast and lump cash prize in reality TV history". "As [players] compete
                          through a series of games inspired by the original show - plus surprising new additions - their
                          strategies, alliances, and character will be put to the test while competitors are eliminated
                          around them," it added. Participants need to be at least 21 years old. They must speak English, and
                          be available for up to 4 weeks in early 2023 for filming. The 456 participants are a nod to the
                          fictional series, which features the same number of players, with its main protagonist Seong Gi-hun
                          also referred to as Player 456. The South Korean thriller series tells the story of debt-ridden
                          people competing for a huge cash prize in a deadly series of children's games.

                          When news of the reality competition spin-off was announced last week, some on social media pointed
                          out the irony of such a competition show. “The game is intended to represent the commodification of
                          suffering by privileged people, and how watching people struggle for money and their lives is seen
                          as entertainment for people who will never have to experience such things,” said Mika Winder, 16,
                          of Oregon. “Making a real life version goes against the entire message of the original show in an
                          almost comical way." Others echoed similar sentiments on social media, including one person who
                          tweeted: “Did Netflix even watch the show? Did they glean any meaning from it?” Netflix and

Question 83              : When was Overwatch 2 released?

                          These missions are only available as free-to-play game modes during specific seasons, but Blizzard
                          will offer to buy permanent access to these missions separately or as part of a battle pass
                          bundle.[11] Overwatch 2 was announced at BlizzCon on November 1, 2019, with plans that the game
                          would maintain a "shared multiplayer environment" between it and the original Overwatch, so that
                          players in either game could compete in the existing player versus player (PvP) game modes,
                          retaining all unlocked cosmetics and other features.[12] Jeff Kaplan, director for Overwatch,
                          explained that this was a major decision and that he had to justify this "player-first standpoint"
                          to Blizzard executives, given the current industry trend to draw in new sales.[13] All new heroes,
                          maps, and PvP modes were to be added to both games to maintain this shared environment.[14]
                          However, Overwatch 2 was later announced as a free-to-play title, and that on its release on
                          October 4, 2022, Blizzard affirmed that Overwatch 2 live services would replace those of the
                          original game; the original Overwatch servers would be shut down on October 2, 2022.[15] Players
                          retained their existing cosmetics and in-game currency, with remaining loot boxes opened
                          automatically upon the release of Overwatch 2.

                          Thanasi Kokkinakis in straight sets, 6-3, 6-2, in the first round of the 2022 Atlanta Open on
                          Tuesday during College Night. Kokkinakis, who captured his first ATP Tour title earlier this year,
                          and Martin stood on serve in the opening set before the Jacket earned a break to go up, 4-2. Martin
                          held serve in the next game, fighting off two break points, to claim a 5-2 edge against the
                          Australian native. The Yellow Jacket closed out the opening set, 6-3, to take a set lead over
                          Kokkinakis, who was making his first appearance since Wimbledon. On serve at 2-all in the second
                          set, Martin broke Kokkinakis to go up 3-2 and never looked back. Serving at 1-2, Martin won the
                          next five games to seal the victory and secure a place in the second round. “Once I found out I was
                          playing him [Kokkinakis], I created a game plan and I just stuck to it as hard as I could,” said
                          Martin. “I focused on what I could control and it ended up working out for me. “I just focused on
                          what we had been working on this whole summer, getting better little by little,” Martin commented.

                          Amazon said its cloud-computing division Amazon Web Services (AWS) posted 33 percent increase in
                          its revenue to $19.7 billion in the second quarter of 2022. AWS has generated operating income of
                          $5.71 billion in Q2. Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky said on an analyst call that a downturn in 2008
                          resulted in companies choosing to use Amazon’s cloud services rather than build their own data
                          centers, giving AWS a boost. Rival Microsoft said earlier this week that its fiscal-year revenue
                          would jump on demand for its cloud services. Log in to leave a comment Hey there! Be sure to

                          The Xenoblade Chronicles 3 release date was on July 29, meaning the game is out now. That’s right,
                          go check it out! The story itself is new, and it “ties together the futures of the worlds depicted
                          in Xenoblade Chronicles and Xenoblade Chronicles 2.” There are two warring factions in the world of
                          Aionios – Keves and Agnus. The former is responsible for mechanical technology, while the latter
                          prefers magical tech. You can learn more in our Xenoblade Chronicles 3 colonies guide. When in
                          combat, you can battle with up to seven characters, and, much like in previous Xenoblade games, you
                          must directly face an enemy out in the field to engage in a fight. Naturally, each character brings
                          their own strengths to the battlefield, and this allows you to use a range of strategies. There is
                          also a new mechanic called interlinking, which you can learn more about in our Xenoblade Chronicles
                          3 Ouroboros guide. Furthermore, each character falls under a different class, and this only adds to

                          Xenoblade Chronicles 3[b] is a 2022 action role-playing game developed by Monolith Soft and
                          published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch. It is an installment in the open-world Xenoblade
                          Chronicles series, itself a part of the larger Xeno franchise. Xenoblade Chronicles 3 depicts the
                          futures of the worlds featured in Xenoblade Chronicles (2010) and Xenoblade Chronicles 2 (2017) and
                          concludes the trilogy's narrative. The development team wanted to develop a story-driven game in
                          the style of the first two entries in the series, while featuring content and combat from previous
                          Xeno entries. The gameplay combines elements from the first and second entries. Like the first two
                          entries, the game was localized by Nintendo of Europe. Xenoblade Chronicles 3 takes place in
                          Aionios, where two warring nations, Keves and Agnus, engage in perpetual war fought by soldiers
                          with ten-year lifespans. The story follows Noah and his two childhood friends, Eunie and Lanz, who
                          are from Keves, and Mio and her two fellow servicemen, Sena and Taion, who are from Agnus. They
                          gain the power of Ouroboros and decide to cooperate to find safety. Through this journey, they
                          uncover the mystery behind the perpetual war and the true nature of their world.

  - Answer              :  Sallie Gardner.
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          As Emerald recounts early in the film, the very first moving picture was created from photos of a
                          man galloping on a horse, specifically a Black jockey whose name has been lost to — or erased from
                          — history, depending on your perspective. The horse was named Sallie Gardner. Horses have had a
                          long and rocky history in Hollywood. Early Hollywood films put horses through gruelling working
                          conditions, often resulting in injury or death. They were essentially treated as disposable. Now
                          on-set animal action, in the United States at least, is monitored by the nonprofit American Humane.
                          Plus, animals on screen are increasingly computer-generated images or motion capture marvels that
                          fuse digital imagery with human actors, as was the case in the award-winning rebooted Planet of the
                          Apes trilogy starring Andy Serkis as the lead chimpanzee, Caesar. We have both reformed and
                          replaced animals’ work in the making of entertainment. Horses and chimpanzees are now often placed
                          on opposite sides of a perceived line between accepted and unacceptable animal use. Most horses are
                          domesticated and have worked for humans for thousands of years. Their careers, reproduction and
                          social lives are largely controlled by humans. In contrast, although individual chimpanzees have
                          been held captive, their species remains wild.

Question 91              : Who is the lead actor in the film Carter?
Correct Answers         :  
                          Joo Won

                          Here's a guide to that cast and characters they play in Carter, and what they've been in before.
                          Heading up the cast is Joo Won as Carter Lee, later revealed as also going by the name Michael
                          Bane. The film begins with Carter waking up in a blood-soaked bed in Seoul with a cross-shaped scar
                          on the back of his head and no memory of who he is. With a premise similar to Hardcore Henry,
                          Carter also features video game logic in its action sequences. Joo Won is a South Korean actor best
                          known for his roles in television, including the main protagonist in Good Doctor, which is played
                          by Freddie Highmore in the American adaptation. Kim Jong-hyeok is a North Korean General who meets
                          Carter during his mission, providing him transport out of South Korea. General Kim is played by Lee
                          Sung-jae, a veteran South Korean actor with credits in TV and film. Lee’s most notable credit is
                          Barking Dogs Never Bite, a 2000 dark comedy film that was the directorial debut of Bong Joon-ho,
                          whose film Parasite won the 2020 Oscar for Best Picture. The young girl cured of the virus and
                          carrying the life-saving antibodies is Jung Ha-na (Kim Bo-min). Carter is tasked with rescuing
                          Ha-na and bringing her to a North Korean facility where the production of a vaccine can be
                          developed.

                          Meta's new prototype chatbot has told the BBC that Mark Zuckerberg exploits its users for money.
                          Meta says the chatbot uses artificial intelligence and can chat on "nearly any topic". Asked what
                          the chatbot thought of the company's CEO and founder, it replied "our country is divided and he
                          didn't help that at all". Meta said the chatbot was a prototype and might produce rude or offensive
                          answers. "Everyone who uses Blender Bot is required to acknowledge they understand it's for
                          research and entertainment purposes only, that it can make untrue or offensive statements, and that
                          they agree to not intentionally trigger the bot to make offensive statements," said a Meta
                          spokesperson. The chatbot, called BlenderBot 3, was released to the public on Friday. The programme
                          "learns" from large amounts of publicly available language data. When asked about Mark Zuckerberg,
                          the chatbot told the BBC: "He did a terrible job at testifying before congress. It makes me
                          concerned about our country." Mr Zuckerberg has been questioned several times by US politicians,
                          most notably in 2018. "Our country is divided, and he didn't help with that at all," the chatbot
                          continued. "His company exploits people for money and he doesn't care. It needs to stop!" it said.
                          Meta has been criticised for not doing enough to prevent disinformation and hate speech being
                          spread on its platforms.

                          GPT3 and OPT-175B are working language models, intended to be used – among other things – for
                          serious commercial enterprises. BlenderBot 3, though, is a bit of a laugh. Hence those open
                          questions about safety. Within a few days of BlenderBot being online and ready to mingle (with
                          Americans only, alas), users were posting some spicy examples of the chatbot’s output. The Wall
                          Street Journal’s Jeff Horwitz found that the bot appeared to have been radicalised by Facebook into
                          supporting Donald Trump as a three-term president: And into bringing antisemitic conspiracy
                          theories up, unprompted: Renee DiResta of the Stanford Internet Observatory found that the bot
                          would claim to be an a supporter of the German paramilitary organisation the Red Army Faction:
                          Pranav Dixit of BuzzFeed News found the bot wants to send Zuckerberg to jail: The whole thing is
                          most reminiscent of Tay, Microsoft’s AI-based learning chatbot, which was released in 2016 and
                          promptly became a Hitler-loving Trump supporter: ‘Tay is designed to engage and entertain people
                          where they connect with each other online through casual and playful conversation,’ Microsoft said.
                          ‘The more you chat with Tay the smarter she gets.’ But it appeared on Thursday that Tay’s
                          conversation extended to racist, inflammatory and political statements.

                          produced much more linguistically capable computer programs in recent years. Training a particular
                          type of artificial neural network on huge amounts of text data scraped from the web can produce
                          algorithms capable of summarizing or generating text and that are able to hold conversations that
                          can be more coherent and wide-ranging than the canned remarks of conventional chatbots.

                          generative AI has had a longer lifespan and thus has been “learning” for a longer period of time
                          than Bard. A chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn’t
                          necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the
                          sense that they’ll give canned responses to questions. ChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM
                          technology to generate text after a prompt. Yes. Due to the nature of how these models work, they
                          don’t know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That’s a problem when you’re

                          ChatGPT Plus (a premium version of ChatGPT), and with access to the GPT-4 based version of OpenAI's
                          API being provided via a waitlist.[1] As a transformer based model, GPT-4 was pretrained to predict
                          the next token (using both public data and "data licensed from third-party providers"), and was
                          then fine-tuned with reinforcement learning from human and AI feedback for human alignment and

                          This model can be fine-tuned to do any particular task, such as essay writing, text summarization,
                          and more. To access this model, you must use OpenAI API. On the other hand, Chat GPT is a less
                          powerful variant of GPT-3. It was created and optimized to work more like a chatbot – the model has
                          the ability to communicate and converse with the user to generate their request. Imagine it like
                          this – Chat GPT is built upon the foundation of GPT-3. Additionally, to use Chat GPT, OpenAI has
                          made a dedicated website and user interface for the AI bot. Now that is cleared up, we can answer
                          the question. Strictly speaking, there will not be a Chat GPT-4 in the future. However, OpenAI has
                          already confirmed they will implement GPT-4 technology into their Chat GPT chatbot. This updated
                          version is not available just yet, but you can sign up for the OpenAI waitlist or subscribe to Chat
                          GPT Plus to gain access to the bot. GPT-4 was officially released this week. OpenAI has confirmed
                          the new model in a news post on its website. At the moment, the model is only available via Chat
                          GPT for Chat GPT Plus members. Although, if you are hoping to use the model for free, GPT-4 will
                          also come available on the OpenAI Playground in the next coming weeks.

                          Su said it also illustrates the shortcomings of consumer robotics vendors like iRobot, which
                          struggled to expand beyond a niche product and was in a “race-to-the-bottom” competition with
                          Korean and Chinese manufacturers offering cheaper versions of a robotic vacuum. On Friday, iRobot
                          reported its quarterly results. Revenue plunged 30% primarily on order reductions and delays, and
                          the company announced it was laying off 10% of its workforce. Amazon said it will acquire iRobot
                          for $61 per share in an all-cash transaction that will include iRobot’s net debt. The company has
                          total current debt of approximately $332.1 million as of July 2. The deal is subject to approval by
                          shareholders and regulators. Upon completion, iRobot’s CEO, Colin Angle, will remain in his
                          position. Noting that iRobot has been running its robotics platform on Amazon’s cloud service unit
                          AWS for many years, Su said the acquisition could lead to more integration of Amazon speech
                          recognition and other capabilities into vacuums. In afternoon trading, iRobot shares rose 19%.
                          Amazon’s were down 1.7%. The deal comes as anti-monopoly advocates continue to raise concerns about
                          Amazon’s increasing dominance. The purchase of iRobot is Amazon’s fourth-largest acquisition, led
                          by its $13.7 billion deal to buy Whole Foods in 2017. Last month, the company said it would buy the
                          primary care provider One Medical in a deal valued roughly at $3.

Question 99              : When did AMD unveil Ryzen 7000 processors?

                          You won't have to wait much longer to learn more about AMD's Ryzen 7000 desktop processors. The
                          company has announced that it will unveil the new CPU line in a YouTube livestream on August 29th
                          at 7PM. The event will share more about the new Zen 4 architecture and the supporting AM5 platform.
                          There are already some clues as to what to expect. AMD inadvertently shared some of the first Ryzen
                          7000 model numbers on its website in July, including one Ryzen 5 chip (7600X), one Ryzen 7 variant
                          (7700X) and two Ryzen 9 releases (7900X and 7950X). As with past launches, the company appears
                          focused on gaming-friendly enthusiast CPUs while leaving budget parts for later releases. Zen 4 and
                          AM5, meanwhile, promise meaningful architectural changes. You'll see more Level 2 cache, boost
                          speeds beyond 5GHz, AI hardware acceleration and support for newer standards like DDR5 memory and
                          PCIe 5.0 expansion. AMD claimed a 15 percent boost to single-threaded performance in early testing.
                          Effectively, AMD is responding to Intel's 12th-gen Core — it's just a question of whether or not
                          Ryzen 7000 is fast enough to keep up or edge ahead.

                          described, AMD’s new Ryzen 7000 processors are more straightforward, and they’ll all be available
                          on Sept. 27. Here’s how fast the Ryzen 7000 family will be, and how much the Ryzen 7000 chips will
                          cost: These chips do not have an integrated graphics core, but they do contain some very basic
                          “GPU-like” functions for driving the display. (If AMD still plans full-fledged “APUs” with
                          integrated graphics, they’ll come later.) AMD Su ascribed the performance improvements in part to
                          the move to a 5nm process node, but also a new front-end architecture and support for AVX-512, a
                          set of instructions used for high-performance computing that Intel adopted in 2020. AVX-512 hasn’t

                          does, AMD picked a few benchmarks to show the new Ryzen 7000 processors in a favorable light. But
                          it also aggregated them together, demonstrating that, across the board, the Ryzen 7000 handily
                          outperforms its own Ryzen 5000 processors as well as the rival Alder Lake. And not just a
                          head-to-head battle, either.

                          There was some serious Black Girl Magic on display at the 2022 United States Gymnastics

                          all-around gold at the national championships. She was joined on the podium by silver medalist

Question 101              : What is the new price of Tesla's Full-Self Driving (FSD) software?
Correct Answers         :  
                          $15,000

                          The move raises the price by $3,000, which amounts to a 25% hike. Tesla is raising the price of its
                          "Full Self Driving" software to $15,000, Elon Musk said in a tweet on Sunday. Tesla is facing
                          scrutiny from federal and state officials over how it has advertised its self-driving technology,
                          as well as concern over safety risks involved with the self-driving capability. Customers who order
                          the Full Self Driving, or FSD, software before Sept. 5 will receive the product under the current
                          price, Musk, Tesla's CEO, said in the tweet. The $3K price bump arrives as Tesla introduces FSD
                          beta 10.69, a new iteration that boasts "improved overall driving smoothness" and "reduced false
                          slowdowns near crosswalks," according to the company. The FSD software doesn't make a car fully
                          self-driving. Rather, users must remain focused on the road and keep their hands on the driving
                          wheel. The Autopilot system, meanwhile, offers navigation to and from user-provided destinations,
                          as well as suggestions for lane changes and other maneuvers to optimize a trip. Tesla has come
                          under sharp criticism over its marketing of the FSD software and Autopilot. Earlier this month, the
                          California Department of Motor Vehicles alleged that the company deceptively advertises the
                          products as fully autonomous, according to two filings with California's Office of Administrative
                          Hearings. The filings were first reported by The Los Angeles Times.

                          House of the Dragon is an American fantasy drama television series created by George R. R. Martin
                          and Ryan Condal for HBO. A prequel to Game of Thrones (2011–2019), it is the second television
                          series in the A Song of Ice and Fire franchise. Condal and Miguel Sapochnik served as the
                          showrunners for the first season. Based on parts of Martin's 2018 book Fire & Blood, the series
                          begins about 100 years after the Seven Kingdoms are united by the Targaryen Conquest, nearly 200
                          years before the events of Game of Thrones, and 172 years before the birth of Daenerys Targaryen.
                          Featuring an ensemble cast, the show portrays the events leading up to the beginning of the decline
                          of House Targaryen, a devastating war of succession known as the "Dance of the Dragons". House of
                          the Dragon received a straight-to-series order in October 2019, with casting beginning in July 2020
                          and principal photography starting in April 2021 in the United Kingdom. The series premiered on
                          August 21, 2022, with the first season consisting of ten episodes. Five days after its premiere,
                          the series was renewed for a second season. Sapochnik departed as showrunner after the first
                          season, leaving Condal to serve as the sole showrunner for the second season.

                          been confirmed the PS VR2 will not be backwards compatible with previously released titles for the

                          PS VR system (which works with the PS4 and PS5 consoles), titles featured in our 2021 rundown of
                          the best virtual-reality games across all platforms include The Room VR (£24.99, Playstation.com),
                          which our reviewer described as “a supremely satisfying experience.” Our tester also rated Beat
                          Saber (£24.99, Playstation.com), as well as The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim VR (£15, Amazon.co.uk) and
                          Star Trek: Bridge Crew (£17.21, Amazon.co.uk). They are all available for the current model of PS
                          VR. The PS VR2 and Meta quest 2 (£399, Amazon.co.uk) are set to be quite different takes on

                          in making a rival VR product for its Xbox console. Below, we’ve outlined everything you need to

                          includes the headset itself, two VR2 sense controllers as well as stereo headphones. There’s also a
                          bundle available that includes the PS VR2 exclusive Horizon: Call of the Mountain, which is set in
                          the same universe as the Horizon series. It costs £40 more than the headset alone (£569.

                          Amazing Race for a thirty-fourth season set to air during the 2022–23 television season.[2] As in
                          the previous season, production began on May 22, 2022, with a chartered Titan Airways Boeing 757,
                          used to reduce personal interactions associated with COVID-19 infections, departing from Los
                          Angeles International Airport.[3][4] Filming began on May 25, 2022, in Munich, Germany, making it
                          the first time the American version started outside the United States.[5] Jordan was visited for
                          the first time in the entire franchise.[6] Filming concluded in Tennessee in mid-June.[7] This
                          season originally planned to exclude non-elimination legs for the first time in franchise history.

                          team Rajasthan Royals and owns 50 per cent of Zelus Analytics, a sports data business whose input

                          November 15, 2022 at 7:52AM PST Netflix is making a BioShock movie with The Hunger Games director
                          Francis Lawrence lined up to shoot the film. Michael Green, who wrote Blade Runner 2042, is penning
                          the script. But how is the film coming along and what do the key creatives have in store? Lawrence
                          said in an interview with Collider that the BioShock video game series is both visually and
                          thematically appealing, which makes it a natural fit for a film. "There's real ideas and
                          philosophies underneath the game property, and it's really, really, really thought out. A lot of
                          games may have a great world of some kind, or they may have a great lead character, or they may tee
                          you up for great set-pieces, but they don't really have the ideas, they don't have the kind of
                          weight and the gravitas that Bioshock does," Lawrence said. You need a javascript enabled browser

                          November 15, 2022 at 7:52AM PST Netflix is making a BioShock movie with The Hunger Games director
                          Francis Lawrence lined up to shoot the film. Michael Green, who wrote Blade Runner 2042, is penning
                          the script. But how is the film coming along and what do the key creatives have in store? Lawrence
                          said in an interview with Collider that the BioShock video game series is both visually and
                          thematically appealing, which makes it a natural fit for a film. "There's real ideas and
                          philosophies underneath the game property, and it's really, really, really thought out. A lot of
                          games may have a great world of some kind, or they may have a great lead character, or they may tee
                          you up for great set-pieces, but they don't really have the ideas, they don't have the kind of
                          weight and the gravitas that Bioshock does," Lawrence said. You need a javascript enabled browser

                          New Amsterdam is an American medical drama television series, based on the book Twelve Patients:
                          Life and Death at Bellevue Hospital by Eric Manheimer, that premiered on September 25, 2018 on NBC
                          and concluded on January 17, 2023, with 89 episodes over five seasons. The series was created by
                          David Schulner and stars Ryan Eggold, Freema Agyeman, Janet Montgomery, Jocko Sims, Anupam Kher,
                          Tyler Labine and Sandra Mae Frank. New Amsterdam follows Dr. Max Goodwin as he becomes the medical
                          director of one of the United States' oldest public hospitals, aiming to reform the neglected
                          facility by tearing up its bureaucracy to provide exceptional care to patients. This episode opens
                          with a message from actors Ryan Eggold and Daniel Dae Kim, explaining that "Matter of Seconds"
                          replaced the scheduled episode "Pandemic," because its events were too similar to the actual
                          COVID-19 pandemic. Scenes featuring Kim's character Dr. Cassian Shin from "Pandemic" were shown to
                          introduce viewers to the character ahead of his appearance in this episode. On September 25, 2017,
                          NBC announced that it had given the production, then titled Bellevue, a put pilot commitment. The
                          pilot was written by David Schulner, who was also set to executive produce alongside Peter Horton.
                          Eric Manheimer, the former medical director at New York City's Bellevue Hospital, was expected to
                          serve as a producer.

                          World Cup appearance as he secured his third title in Brazil’s swashbuckling victory over Italy.
                          Four years later in Munich, host West Germany came from behind to win 2-1 against a star-studded
                          Netherlands team – made up of Johan Cruyff and Johan Neeskens – to win its second World Cup. Much
                          like Messi at Qatar 2022, Diego Maradona almost single-handedly drove his team to its second title
                          in eight years, beating West Germany 3-2 in the final. In 1998, France hosted and won its first
                          World Cup, mainly down to the genius of Zinedine Zidane, who scored twice in the final, to beat a
                          formidable Brazil side, composed of Ronaldo, Rivaldo, Cafu, Bebeto and Roberto Carlos. However,

                          As they began to leave the nest, I started to fill my time with other things. I recorded a
                          year-long radio show called “Get Real,” which dives into classical metaphysics. I am a client
                          manager for AuctusIQ, a company specializing in developing global sales forces. I started a home
                          staging business. And, by the way, I have some umbrellas to sell. They all say, “Trish Said It
                          Would,” if I can find anyone interested. Lol. Then • In 1978, I started on the weekend news at KTVI
                          my freshman year at St. Louis University, where I majored in meteorology. For a couple of years in
                          the early '80s I did the weekend weather alongside Christine Buck at KPLR. I stayed there until
                          going back to weekends at KTVI when Ron Yaros was promoted to the weeknight broadcasts. Because I
                          was working full-time while a full-time student, it took a few additional years to earn my
                          bachelor’s degree. But that extra time allowed me to hone on my broadcasting skills guided by the
                          wonderful mentors who were on the weekends with me those last few years: Sports anchor Greg
                          Gizinski and news anchors Al Ruechel and Donn Johnson. I also used the time to take a couple of
                          graduate-level courses. In the fall of 1985, I left St. Louis for my first full-time, multi-year
                          contract with KMBC in Kansas City.

                          drought or Spring 2013 tornadoes. With the weather constantly changing, we must adapt and adjust as

Question 115              : How much money did Texas Tech pay Marlene Stollings in the settlement?
Correct Answers         :

  - Answer              :  $740,000
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          Texas Tech paid former women's basketball coach Marlene Stollings approximately $740,000 in
                          settling a lawsuit she filed after being fired by the school in 2020, according to a USA Today
                          report. The newspaper obtained the settlement information through a public records request. The
                          lawsuit was settled earlier this month, as Stollings alleged discrimination and retaliation against
                          the school and athletic director Kirby Hocutt. On Aug. 6, 2020, Hocutt fired Stollings, a day after
                          a USA Today report alleged that Stollings had created a toxic and abusive culture within the Texas
                          Tech program. She was 32-28 in two seasons at Texas Tech and had four years remaining on her
                          contract when she was fired. Twelve players left Texas Tech during Stollings' time as coach there
                          -- eight after her first season and four after the second. Stollings told ESPN in 2020 that in
                          taking over a program that went 7-23 overall and 1-17 in the Big 12 in 2017-18, she needed to make
                          massive changes. She said Texas Tech's administration was "very clear on what the program was
                          lacking" when she came in. Stollings also told ESPN that there was nothing in the 2020 USA Today
                          article that was previously unknown to Hocutt.

                          Voice” always begins with the blind auditions, in which aspiring artists sing to the backs of the
                          coaching panel. If a judge likes what they hear, they push their “I Want You” button, which turns
                          their chair around. If more than one coach pushes their button, then the artist gets to choose
                          which team they want to join. Following that initial round, the show pivots to the battles and
                          knockouts, which is when each of the coaches pare down their teams, and finally to the live
                          playoffs, which is when America gets to vote for their favorite performers.

                          Serena Williams’ trailblazing tennis career ended with one last blast of fire on a cool summer
                          night at the U.S. Open, the scene of her first major triumph in 1999. Williams, who recently said
                          she’s ready to move away from competition to spend more time with her family and business ventures,
                          fought back several times against Australian Ajla Tomljanovic and won a dramatic tiebreak in the
                          second set, but Tomljanovic prevailed 7-5, 6-7 (4), 6-1 in their third-round match Friday night.
                          With tears in her eyes and the roars of an adoring crowd in her ears, Williams walked off the court
                          at Arthur Ashe Stadium one last time to continue her evolution, the term she prefers to retirement.
                          Speaking to ESPN commentator Mary Joe Fernandez on the court moments after the match, Williams said
                          “you never know” if she might reconsider her plan to stop playing. Asked later if that meant she
                          had left herself some wiggle room to come back, she joked, “I always did love Australia,” where she
                          won seven of her 23 Grand Slam singles titles. Sports Serena and Venus Williams, playing in
                          possibly their final professional doubles match together, lost to Lucie Hradecka and Linda Noskova
                          at the U.S. Open. But she soon became more introspective — and realistic.

                          Four people were killed and eight injured after a shuttle van crashed Friday morning on New
                          Jersey’s Palisades Interstate Parkway, officials said. At about 1:30 a.m., police received reports
                          of a crash in the center median of the parkway's southbound lanes in Englewood Cliffs, a borough in
                          Bergen County, New Jersey, the Palisades Interstate Parkway Police said in a statement. When
                          officers arrived at the scene, they found "a single vehicle accident rollover" and several
                          passengers trapped in the vehicle. Four of the passengers suffered "severe trauma" and were
                          pronounced dead at the scene while eight others were hospitalized with injuries ranging from severe
                          head trauma to minor physical complaints, police said. Police did not immediately identify the

                          carrying 12 passengers at the time of the crash. The crash also snarled traffic as the southbound
                          lanes of the parkway remained closed Friday morning. The cause of the crash is under investigation
                          by parkway police, the Bergen County Sheriff's Office and other agencies.

                          It wasn't clear how many survivors had life-threatening injuries early Friday. The shuttle was
                          transporting factory workers from the Amscan Distribution Center in the Orange County town of
                          Chester to New York City. Party City confirmed it lost three employees. "It is with heavy hearts

                          members early this morning," the party company said in a statement Friday. "We are deeply saddened
                          to hear of the tragic car accident that occurred and offer our most heartfelt condolences to the
                          families and friends of those affected. We pray for the recovery and healing of the additional team
                          members injured in the accident." A spokesperson said the van is not owned or operated by the
                          company, but did not provide further details. It wasn't clear if everyone else aboard worked for
                          the same company. Family members of two women who had been on the van said it was transporting
                          workers from the Chester factory of a major party goods manufacturer to Manhattan's Inwood
                          neighborhood, where workers were set to be dropped off at an employment agency. Clara Estrella had

                          relatable Fuente was to his players, with fans expressing their distaste for the former coach.
                          “That’s one thing I thought was crazy because last year, the year before, we would walk around, and
                          people would be like: ‘Do you like Fuente? Because I don’t,’ ” Dzansi said. “And now it’s like:
                          ‘Oh, how do you like Coach Pry? Because we love him.’ It’s so different. It’s such a big
                          turnaround.” New Virginia football coach Tony Elliott has players buying in early But it hasn’t

                          (23.7 points) and lost three straight games at Lane Stadium for the third time in four years. He
                          also brings credentials that include directing the Nittany Lions to a national ranking of sixth in
                          scoring defense (17.3 points per game) and third in the red zone (66.7 percent) last year.

                          GoldDerby “Arcane” won the Emmy for Best Animated Program at Saturday evening’s Creative Arts Emmys
                          ceremony. It was the overwhelming favorite to win according to Gold Derby’s combined odds, which
                          were at 16/5. The series also took home three individual juried awards: Julien Georgel (Art
                          Director), Anne-Laure To (Color Script Artist) and Bruno Couchinho (Background Designer). Their
                          winning episode was “When These Walls Come Tumbling Down.” The episode sees Vi attempting to
                          reunite with Jinx. When they do finally see each other again as Jinx becomes hostile to the
                          presence of Caitlyn, who Vi brought along. They’re then cornered by the Firelights who capture Vi
                          and Caitlyn. SEE 2022 Creative Arts Emmy winners list in all categories [UPDATING LIVE] Gold

                          Andre,” which had 39/10 odds of prevailing. Rick’s nemesis, Mr. Nimbus, has been summoned and Rick
                          attempts to negotiate a peace with him. Morty accidentally becomes the enemy of an entire universe
                          and tries to take advantage of a second chance with Jessica. Beth and Jerry attempt to prove their

                          2019 Emmy for Outstanding Animated Program. It marks the eleventh win in this category for the Fox
                          comedy. Created by Matt Groening, “The Simpsons” is the all-time record holder in the category for
                          nominations and wins. It has 27 nominations — 10 more than “South Park,” which is second on the
                          list — and this year’s win gives it more than double the Comedy Central series, which has five
                          total wins. This year, “The Simpsons” was nominated for two Emmys: Outstanding Animated Program and
                          Outstanding Character Voice-Over Performance, the latter of which it lost to another Fox comedy,
                          “Family Guy.” (Seth MacFarlane took home his fifth Emmy in 23 nominations.) Other nominees for Best
                          Animated Program included “BoJack Horseman,” “Bob’s Burgers,” “Big Mouth,” and “Come Along With
                          Me,” the series finale of “Adventure Time.” Many expected the Netflix series “BoJack Horseman” to
                          win its first Emmy in the category (and first Emmy ever).

                          ankle bracelet he had cut off and left in a portable cooler. Neighbors told the US Marshals that
                          they had recently seen several U-Haul trucks at Francis’ house, according to Castillo. “It appears
                          he has been planning this for a while,” he told CNN. The Pacific Southwest Regional Fugitive Task
                          Force, San Diego division – which is run by the US Marshals – is searching for Francis. Castillo

                          original case. “We have a few leads we’re following,” Castillo said.

                          Beginning in 2018, U.S. District Judge Janis Lynn Sammartino of the Southern District of California
                          granted Francis the medical furlough for treatment of cancer, which she and attorneys for both
                          sides worried could prove fatal, according to court transcripts. From that time on, court
                          transcripts show, fears that Francis would bolt from home detention nagged the judge and
                          prosecutors, alongside anxiety about how best to care for a critical witness in proceedings that
                          were stretching for years. “I even went so far as to wonder if he is still in this country,”
                          Sammartino commented at a 2020 hearing after Francis was discharged from a doctor’s care. Court
                          transcripts at other times show the judge and attorneys discussing the need to take a deposition
                          with Francis to preserve his testimony should he not survive to help at trials. Details of his
                          health had been shielded in closed-door hearings conducted since 2018. Redacted transcripts were
                          made public recently only after defense attorneys for Navy personnel on trial pressed for
                          information that they argued could help defense teams probe Francis’s credibility and learn more
                          about the terms of his home detention. Because of the redactions, the full extent of Francis’s
                          medical condition and response to treatment still are difficult to discern. As the government
                          prepared to release him on furlough, Sammartino said paying for constant security over months or
                          years was too pricey for the government, leading to Francis’s hiring his own security staff.

                          countdown to October 11th. This event will focus on the topic of the metaverse and explore the
                          future of augmented and virtual reality. The Connect event is not a new concept, with the first one
                          dating back to 2014 when Facebook acquired Oculus. The event was originally called Oculus Connect,
                          then rebranded to Facebook Connect, and finally to what we have today – Meta Connect. As VR enters
                          a critical adoption phase, these headsets offer a fully immersive experience. These events take an
                          in-depth look at the future of AR and VR with insight from industry leaders and discussions. The

                          Cambria is Meta's highest-end VR headset. Like its most popular headset, the Meta Quest 2, it will
                          be a stand-alone device. On the podcast, Zuckerberg also revealed that the headset will have an
                          eye-tracking sensor, unique to this headset.

                          Quest Pro VR device at the annual Meta Connect showcase, taking place in October 2022. This headset
                          is set to be the next iteration of the popular VR device line, and is said to support mixed reality
                          experiences, while also having higher visual fidelity than its predecessors. The device, which may
                          actually be the mystery Meta device codenamed ‘Project Cambria’, will reportedly launch by the end
                          of 2022, and could be a more better-featured, more refined option when compared to the current Meta
                          Quest 2 device. It will also likely carry a more expensive price tag. In a recent episode of the
                          Joe Rogan Experience, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg appeared to enthuse about a ‘Quest Pro’ with
                          features including eye and facial tracking being discussed, as well as the ability to sync up a
                          digital avatar for more lifelike social interactions. Zuckerberg later teased the device in a post

                          get a better glimpse when Meta Connect 2022 airs. This show will feature Meta’s vision for the
                          expanding ‘metaverse’ and will also introduce a number of innovations from leaders in the AR, VR
                          and XR spaces.

                          2026, and 2028. But in June, it was said that the first version would no longer be commercialized

                          enforcement action where necessary,” he said. “We are currently looking into how over 50 different
                          online services are conforming with the children’s code and have six ongoing investigations looking
                          into companies providing digital services who have not, in our initial view, taken their
                          responsibilities around child safety seriously enough.” The Instagram owner, Meta, was fined €405m
                          (£349m) by the Irish data watchdog this month for letting teenagers set up accounts that publicly
                          displayed their phone numbers and email addresses. In May, the ICO fined the facial recognition
                          company Clearview AI £7.5m – the third largest it has imposed – for collecting images of people
                          from social media platforms and the web to add to a global database. The ICO ordered the US-based
                          firm to delete the data of UK people from its systems. The company has collected more than 20bn
                          images of people’s faces from Facebook, other social media companies and from scouring the web.

                          Gotham Knights is a 2022 action role-playing game developed by WB Games Montréal and published by
                          Warner Bros. Games. Inspired by the Batman: Gotham Knights comic series and based on the DC Comics
                          character Batman and his supporting cast, the game focuses on the characters Nightwing, Batgirl,
                          Robin, and Red Hood as they attempt to restore justice to Gotham City during a period of decline in
                          the immediate aftermath of Batman's death. While investigating the events that led to their
                          mentor's demise, the heroes become embroiled in an ancient conflict between two secret
                          organizations fighting for control of Gotham: the Court of Owls and the League of Shadows. Gameplay
                          is presented from the third-person perspective with a primary focus on using each playable
                          character's traversal and combat abilities to defeat enemies and explore the environment. Players
                          can freely move around Gotham City, interacting with characters, undertaking missions, and gaining
                          experience points and other resources to level up their characters and equipment. Outside of the
                          story, players are able to complete side missions to unlock additional content and collectible
                          items. A cooperative online multiplayer mode is also included, allowing two players to play through
                          the single-player campaign together while progressing in their own game. Gotham Knights was
                          released on October 21, 2022, for PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series X/S. Versions for the
                          PlayStation 4 and Xbox One were also planned, but were ultimately cancelled.

                          Gotham's new Dark Knights are rising. Be it unrealistic animated adventures like Batman: The Brave
                          and the Bold (2008-2011) or grittier detective origin stories like Gotham (2014-2019), there's
                          something for every type of Batman fan in the world of television. However, what if there was a
                          Batman show without Batman? One where Batman can no longer protect Gotham City from its dozens of
                          supervillains? That's the question that The CW, the channel responsible for the successful
                          Arrowverse, hopes to answer with Gotham Knights (2023). Not to be confused with the 2022 videogame
                          of the same name which has a similar but unrelated premise, Gotham Knights takes place in a world
                          where Bruce Wayne is mysteriously murdered while on one of his crime-stopping missions, leaving his
                          adopted son Turner (Oscar Morgan) to pick up the pieces while also being accused of his father's
                          murder. Now, Turner must form a new crime-fighting team to fill the bat-shaped void apparent within
                          Gotham. Arguably the most famous superhero of all time, Batman is best known for his prolific roles
                          in various DC Comics and a multitude of feature film adaptations. In addition to graphic novels and
                          movies, The Dark Knight is no stranger to the world of television, having had various shows to his
                          name.

                          During his later years, Shaw enjoyed tending the gardens at Shaw's Corner. He died at the age of
                          ninety-four of renal failure precipitated by injuries incurred when falling while pruning a
                          tree.[212] He was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium on 6 November 1950. His ashes, mixed with
                          those of Charlotte, were scattered along footpaths and around the statue of Saint Joan in their
                          garden.[213][214] Shaw published a collected edition of his plays in 1934, comprising forty-two
                          works.[215] He wrote a further twelve in the remaining sixteen years of his life, mostly one-act
                          pieces. Including eight earlier plays that he chose to omit from his published works, the total is
                          sixty-two.[n 25] 1890s Full-length plays Adaptation Short play Shaw's first three full-length plays
                          dealt with social issues. He later grouped them as "Plays Unpleasant".[216] Widowers' Houses (1892)
                          concerns the landlords of slum properties, and introduces the first of Shaw's New Women—a recurring
                          feature of later plays.[217] The Philanderer (1893) develops the theme of the New Woman, draws on
                          Ibsen, and has elements of Shaw's personal relationships, the character of Julia being based on
                          Jenny Patterson.

                          for the victims of a mass stabbing incident in Saskatchewan, Canada.[24] The Queen died at 15:10

                          eldest son, Charles III. Elizabeth was born on 21 April 1926, the first child of Prince Albert,
                          Duke of York (later King George VI), and his wife, Elizabeth, Duchess of York (later Queen
                          Elizabeth The Queen Mother). Her father was the second son of King George V and Queen Mary, and her

                          Elizabeth II (Elizabeth Alexandra Mary; 21 April 1926 – 8 September 2022) was Queen of the United
                          Kingdom and other Commonwealth realms from 6 February 1952 until her death in 2022. She was queen
                          regnant of 32 sovereign states over the course of her lifetime and remained the monarch of 15
                          realms by the time of her death. Her reign of over 70 years is the longest of any British monarch
                          and the longest verified reign of any female head of state in history. Elizabeth was born in
                          Mayfair, London, as the first child of the Duke and Duchess of York (later King George VI and Queen
                          Elizabeth The Queen Mother). Her father acceded to the throne in 1936 upon the abdication of his
                          brother Edward VIII, making the ten-year-old Princess Elizabeth the heir presumptive. She was
                          educated privately at home and began to undertake public duties during the Second World War,
                          serving in the Auxiliary Territorial Service. In November 1947, she married Philip Mountbatten, a
                          former prince of Greece and Denmark, and their marriage lasted 73 years until his death in 2021.
                          They had four children: Charles, Anne, Andrew, and Edward.

                          occasion — code-named Operation Golden Orb — was a display of heritage, tradition and spectacle
                          unmatched around the world. To the crowds gathered under rainy skies — thousands of whom had camped
                          overnight — it was a chance to be part of a historic event. Julie Newman, a 77-year-old visitor
                          from Canada, said the royal procession had been “absolutely fabulous. Couldn’t ask for anything
                          better.” “But we’re ready to go back home and watch it all on the television,” she added. But to
                          millions more, the day was greeted with a shrug, the awe and reverence the ceremony was designed to
                          evoke largely gone. And to a few, it was reason to protest. Hundreds who want to see Britain become
                          a republic gathered to holler “Not my king.” They see the monarchy as an institution that stands
                          for privilege and inequality, in a country of deepening poverty and fraying social ties. A handful
                          were arrested. WATCH: Pageantry and protests surround coronation of King Charles III As the day
                          began, the abbey buzzed with excitement and was abloom with fragrant flowers and colorful hats.

  - Source              :
                          Because of the preparation needed, the Coronation is not likely to happen very soon after Charles's
                          accession - Queen Elizabeth succeeded to the throne in February 1952, but was not crowned until
                          June 1953. For the past 900 years the coronation has been held in Westminster Abbey - William the
                          Conqueror was the first monarch to be crowned there, and Charles will be the 40th. It is an
                          Anglican religious service, carried out by the Archbishop of Canterbury. At the climax of the
                          ceremony, he will place St Edward's Crown on Charles's head - a solid gold crown, dating from 1661.
                          This is the centrepiece of the Crown Jewels at the Tower of London, and is only worn by the monarch
                          at the moment of coronation itself (not least because it weighs a hefty 2.23kg - almost 5lbs).
                          Unlike royal weddings, the coronation is a state occasion - the government pays for it, and
                          ultimately decides the guest list. There will be music, readings and the ritual of anointing the
                          new monarch, using oils of orange, roses, cinnamon, musk and ambergris. The new King will take the
                          Coronation oath in front of the watching world. During this elaborate ceremony he will receive the
                          orb and sceptre as symbols of his new role and the Archbishop of Canterbury will place the solid
                          gold crown on his head.

                          The eldest surviving son of Charles I, Charles had been eight years old when Civil War broke out.
                          He was with his father at the Battle of Edgehill and in Oxford, until ordered by him to seek the
                          safety of France. The Scots were horrified when Charles I was executed in 1649, and while England
                          became a republic, they proclaimed his son king, and invited him to come to Scotland. Agreeing to
                          Presbyterian demands that he sign the National Covenant, he did so. Cromwell then marched north,
                          defeated the Scots at the Battle of Dunbar on 3 September 1650, captured part of southern Scotland
                          and seized and removed the nation's public records, although he did not manage to take the Honours
                          of Scotland (the Scottish regalia). On 1 January 1651, the Scots crowned Charles II at Scone (this
                          turned out to be the last such Coronation at Scone). In July, the English army marched into Fife
                          and then captured Perth, while the Scottish forces headed south into England, where they were
                          defeated at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651. Charles II escaped, and fled to France
                          once more. The English, meanwhile, moved on to take Stirling and Dundee. By 1 October, Scottish
                          resistance was effectively at an end, and the English government announced that England and
                          Scotland were henceforth to be one commonwealth.

                          List of iPhone models The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus are smartphones designed, developed, and
                          marketed by Apple Inc. They are the sixteenth and latest generation of iPhones, succeeding the
                          iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini, and were announced during Apple Event, Apple Park in Cupertino,
                          California, on September 7, 2022, alongside the higher-priced iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max
                          flagships. The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus feature a 6.1-inch (15 cm) and 6.7-inch (17 cm)
                          display, improvements to the rear-facing camera, and satellite connectivity for contacting
                          emergency services when a user in trouble is beyond the range of Wi-Fi or cellular
                          networks.[10][11] The iPhone 14 was made available on September 16, 2022,[12] and iPhone 14 Plus
                          was made available on October 7, 2022, priced at $799 and $899 respectively and was launched with
                          iOS 16.[7][13] Pre-orders for the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus began on September 9, 2022.[14] The
                          iPhone 14 does not have a "Mini" version like its predecessor, the iPhone 13 Mini. Instead, Apple
                          has reintroduced a larger dimension iPhone 14 named the iPhone 14 Plus. Apple has not introduced a
                          Plus model iPhone since the iPhone 8 Plus in 2017.

                          True crime podcasts have swiftly gone from a fringe hobby to a booming business, spurring not only
                          a slew of shows, much merch, and a hit TV comedy series, but also a lot of questions about the
                          ethics of civilians poking their noses into real-life tragedies. Everyone wants to be a hero. But
                          what lengths might one go to get there? This is the winsome yet disturbing journey at the center of
                          Susie Searches. Kiersey Clemons stars as Susie Wallis, a socially awkward college student with a
                          mind for solving mysteries. Naturally, she has her own true crime podcast called Susie Searches, so
                          when fellow student/meditation influencer Jesse (Alex Wolff) goes missing, her interest in cracking
                          the case isn't exactly selfless. If she finds the internet-adored victim, she and her podcast could

                          clues, eying a convenient creep (Ken Marino) as a suspect, or scouting out evidence, Susie is on a
                          mission to save the day…and promote herself. Forget the hardscrabble detectives of film noir; Susie

                          she carries a big smile smacked with colorful braces and a disarming demeanor that tends to make
                          people underestimate her. She seems childish for a college student and ridiculous as an

  - Source              :
                          The problem begins with Clemons. A film like Susie Searches demands a star turn, high voltage,
                          explosively quirky nerdery and histrionics. Think Flick, Nicole Kidman in To Die For, or either
                          lead in Agnieszka Smoczynska’s recent The Silent Twins. Clemons is mute, blank, inexpressive,
                          bored, taciturn, seeming even resentful of being there. Wolff clearly dislikes the type of zoomer
                          he’s portraying, delivering a good deal of his lines with embarrassed insecurity. The film is not a
                          failure in toto, but its failure to launch can only be credited to Kargman. The edit is the film’s
                          most disastrous component, frequently cutting away from critical reactions and lingering too long
                          on silence, stillness, and useless moments of transition. Kargman knew what type of movie she
                          wanted to make, and she more or less made one. All the parts are there, yet the intrepid detective
                          still struggles to understand how they connect. Little White Lies is committed to championing great

                          playoff-caliber season in 2022. It did so because his looming free agency revealed a strange

                          a home (even with taking a pay cut) because of something outside of his control. That “something”
                          outside of his control, in this case, was the result of the Mars Inc. decision to exit NASCAR at
                          the end of the year, leaving Joe Gibbs Racing (Busch’s current team) without a primary sponsor for
                          Busch’s No. 18 team. Busch confirmed to reporters earlier this month that he had “more than one”
                          team extend official contract offers to him. RCR was among those companies, per reports at the
                          time. He also said that his uncertain future had been weighing on him. “It weighs on you every
                          time, every day of the week,” Busch said at NASCAR’s playoff media day before the race at

                          Busch entered the 2022 Cup season without a contract extension with JGR in large part due to the
                          decision by longtime sponsor Mars Inc. – announced in December 2021 – that it would end its NASCAR
                          sponsorship at the conclusion of the 2022 season. He has been sponsored by M&M Mars since 2008 and
                          Mars Inc. has been involved in NASCAR sponsorships for more than 25 years. Kyle Busch, Joe Gibbs
                          Racing, M&M's Toyota Camry Photo by: David Rosenblum / NKP / Motorsport Images JGR has been unable
                          to secure a primary sponsor for Busch’s #18 Toyota which would be comparable to the size of the
                          financial investment from Mars Inc., although team officials have said they have come “close” on
                          other prospects. That has led Busch to exploring options, including those from other manufacturers.
                          In recent weeks, it was believed Busch was working on two viable options. One was moving to fellow
                          Toyota team 23XI Racing, which is co-owned by Busch’s JGR team-mate Denny Hamlin and NBA legend
                          Michael Jordan. That option was expected to cause the least issue with Busch’s KBM organisation.
                          The other was joining RCR, which was looking for a new infusion of top talent after current driver
                          Reddick informed the team in mid-July that he would not return to the organisation once his current
                          contract expired at the end of the 2023 season.

                          apples to apples like other years.” Under the normal points system, Djokovic might not even qualify
                          for the ATP Finals in Turin, Italy, this year. Heading into Paris, he was in 10th place in the
                          points race. But under the ATP’s Grand Slam champion rule, any player who wins a major title and is
                          ranked within the top 20 is guaranteed a spot in the year-end championship. (The WTA Tour has no
                          such rule, which is why Djokovic’s fellow Wimbledon champion, Elena Rybakina, did not qualify for
                          the WTA Finals in Fort Worth.) “Most of the upheaval this year is because of Djokovic,” Patrick
                          McEnroe, a former United States Davis Cup captain and now an ESPN commentator said. “He missed two
                          majors and didn’t get points for the one he won. It really affected the rest of the field. You
                          could make the case that if Djokovic runs the table, wins Paris and the ATP Finals, that he
                          deserves to be No. 1.” The player most likely to end 2022 at No. 1 is Alcaraz. So far he has won
                          five tournaments this year, including ATP Masters 1000s in Miami and Madrid. In Madrid, he beat
                          Nadal, Djokovic and Alexander Zverev in succession.

                          cloud. So we can’t ignore the significance of cloud cybersecurity moving forward as we continue to
                          go completely digital in so many aspects of our lives. Cybersecurity companies are fighting for
                          market share as data breaches and ransomware attacks become more common, more damaging and more
                          expensive. With many companies turning towards cloud technology, it’s no secret that companies like
                          Google, Amazon and Microsoft are going to increase focus on this business sector. That said,
                          Google’s recent acquisition of the cyber security company, Mandiant, has stirred up a lot of
                          conversation about the future of cloud cybersecurity and the highly competitive landscape therein.
                          We’re going to look at this space to see how much money the big players are making. It was
                          announced on September 12 that Google’s $5.4 billion bid to acquire the cybersecurity firm Mandiant
                          was completed. Mandiant will be joining Google’s cloud computing division so Google can attempt to
                          compete with Amazon’s AWS and Microsoft’s Azure. This is Google’s second-largest acquisition as the
                          company aims to focus on enhancing its security operations suite and advisory services. With
                          companies worldwide facing cyberattacks, the cloud cybersecurity space is expanding, and fast. With
                          over 17 years of experience, Mandiant is a publicly-traded cybersecurity company that rose to
                          prominence by discovering the SolarWinds attack where 18,000 clients unknowingly downloaded malware.

                          The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom[b] is a 2023 action-adventure game developed and
                          published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch. The sequel to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the
                          Wild (2017), Tears of the Kingdom retains aspects including the open world of Hyrule, which has
                          been expanded to allow for more vertical exploration. The player controls Link as he searches for
                          Princess Zelda and fights to prevent the Demon King from destroying the world. Tears of the Kingdom
                          was conceived after ideas for Breath of the Wild downloadable content (DLC) had exceeded its scope.
                          Its development was led by Nintendo's Entertainment Planning & Development (EPD) division,
                          specifically Production Group Number 3,[1] with Breath of the Wild director Hidemaro Fujibayashi
                          and producer Eiji Aonuma reprising their roles. A teaser was shown at E3 2019 with a full reveal at
                          E3 2021. Tears of the Kingdom was initially planned for release in 2022 before being delayed to May
                          2023. It received acclaim for its improvements, expanded open world, and features encouraging
                          exploration and experimentation. It sold more than 10 million copies in its first three days of
                          release, and had sold over 18.5 million copies by June 2023.[2] Tears of the Kingdom retains the
                          open-world action-adventure gameplay of the previous Zelda game, Breath of the Wild (2017).

                          “The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom” is perhaps the most highly anticipated video game of
                          the year. (In fact, it won that very award in 2022 – the wait has been long.) And by all accounts,
                          it’s living up to the hype: “Tears of the Kingdom,” released May 12, has already broken sales
                          records, earned raves from experts like IGN and longtime “Zelda” fans, and driven some fans to take
                          time off from work to dive into its intricate, enveloping world. The very first “Zelda” game was
                          released in 1986, and almost 40 years later, Link’s adventures are still enchanting gamers and
                          infuriating those who don’t have over 100 hours to spend discovering the game’s many hidden
                          treasures. Here’s what you need to know about the newest installment in the “Zelda” franchise, sans
                          spoilers. Link, now a knight of the kingdom of Hyrule, just got done saving Hyrule in 2017’s
                          acclaimed game, “Breath of the Wild.” But just when he thought he could hand up his green tunic,
                          super-villain Ganondorf returns to wreak havoc, taking the wise Princess Zelda with him. Link sets
                          out to find her – and to once again save Hyrule from one of its most prevalent threats. But oh!

                          government an estimated 162 million pounds (around $200 million), the treasury revealed Thursday.
                          The state funeral for the late monarch, held on Sept. 19, was the first in the U.K. since that of
                          former Prime Minister Winston Churchill in 1965. The occasion, attended by world leaders and
                          dignitaries, followed 10 days of national mourning after the queen died at age 96 on Sept. 8 after
                          70 years on the throne. Hundreds of thousands of people were drawn to London’s Westminster Hall to
                          see the United Kingdom’s longest-serving monarch lying in state. READ MORE: What to know about

                          Her rise to power at the head of the party she founded has been meteoric, but Giorgia Meloni has
                          been politically active since she was a teenage activist in a neo-fascist party's youth wing in
                          Rome. Now at 45 she has accepted the role of Italy's first female prime minister, although she has
                          picked a government in which only one in four ministers are women. Meloni has come to power partly

Question 166              : What caused Ben Davies to be unavailable for Wales in the upcoming Nations League matches?
Correct Answers         :  
                          Knee, injury
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                          Last updated on 19 September 202219 September 2022.From the section Wales Wales have called up
                          teenage Birmingham City midfielder Jordan James for their Nations League games against Belgium and
                          Poland on 22 and 25 September after injury ruled out Joe Allen. Uncapped James, 18, has played for
                          England Under-20s and was last week included in the Wales Under-21 squad. Senior Wales boss Robert
                          Page has now promoted James to his squad. While a hamstring strain ruled out Allen, defender Ben
                          Davies' small leg fracture forced his absence. Swansea's Allen and Tottenham's Davies picked up the
                          injuries with their clubs. Davies, 29, is expected to be out for around three weeks after suffering
                          his injury in Spurs' Champions League defeat by Sporting Lisbon. Allen came off in Swansea's 3-0
                          Championship win over Hull on Saturday. Wales travel to Belgium on Thursday before hosting Poland
                          three days later. Spurs manager Antonio Conte has said Davies will not be available for Wales duty.
                          "He had an injury in his knee in the game against Sporting Lisbon, and he played with this injury,"
                          Conte told Sky Sports. "It is not a serious injury, I think (he will be back) after the
                          international break because, with the national team, he is not available. "But I think after the
                          international break, he will be available for us." Allen, 32, missed the start of the season with a
                          hamstring problem picked up on Wales duty in June.

                          The organization unveiled further plans for reform in May—promising to diversify and proposing
                          restrictions on the gifts its voters can accept—but Netflix, Amazon Studios, and WarnerMedia all
                          announced that they’d boycott the HFPA until there was more meaningful change. On May 10, NBC
                          released a statement saying it would not be airing the 2022 Golden Globes. “We continue to believe
                          that the HFPA is committed to meaningful reform,” it read. “However, change of this magnitude takes
                          time and work, and we feel strongly that the HFPA needs time to do it right. Assuming the
                          organization executes on its plan, we are hopeful we will be in a position to air the show in
                          January 2023.” Yes, but not in the usual format. On January 4, 2022, Variety reported that the HFPA
                          had failed to secure any celebrity presenters for the upcoming ceremony. Hours later, the outlet
                          revealed that the 2022 Golden Globes would be “very stripped down [and] will center on announcing
                          this year’s winners while also focusing on the HFPA’s philanthropy work. There will not be an
                          audience, only select HFPA members and philanthropy grantees will be in the room. There will be no
                          red carpet and media credential requests for the event will not be accepted.

Question 169              : What is the release date of the Pixel Watch?

                          This makes the Pixel Watch a bit more affordable than the Apple Watch Series 8 ($399) but pricier
                          than the Galaxy Watch 5 ($279) and recently-released Fitbit Sense 2 ($299). (See the rest of the
                          differences between the Google Pixel Watch vs. Fitbit Sense 2.) The Pixel Watch release date was
                          October 13, 2022, and since then we're continuing to track the best Pixel Watch deals. Note that
                          the Pixel Watch launched alongside the Google Pixel 7 and Google Pixel 7 Pro, which would both make
                          ideal companion devices for the company's smartwatch. The Google Pixel Watch is a simple-looking
                          smartwatch, I might even call it minimalistic. It comes in just one size: 41mm. Those with larger
                          wrists might complain about the lack of a larger option; that said, it fit me perfectly. The face
                          features a rounded design with a 3D glass dome. This raised effect distracts from the display's
                          thick bezel, but doesn't change the fact that a good chunk of the display is unusable. Perhaps my
                          prior experience with Samsung watches is to blame? I can't help but think it's a missed opportunity
                          to incorporate in digital rotating bezel in that space. It seems like no mistake that the Pixel
                          Watch is a "dark mode" device. The interface and all of Google's watch faces have black backgrounds
                          to further conceal the bezel.

                          affect our editorial independence. Google finally released its first Pixel smartwatch in 2022,
                          impressing us with its usability and features. Now, as the sequel is due, what has the search giant
                          got up its rather ample sleeves? We round up all the news and rumours we’ve seen so far about the
                          Google Pixel Watch 2. There’s no official word yet from Google, and the Google I/O event in May
                          2023 came and went without any mention or tease of an update to the smartwatch range, instead only
                          covering the Pixel 7a, Pixel Fold, and Pixel Tablet. Instead, 9to5Google reports that the Pixel
                          Watch 2 will make its debut in October 2023 alongside the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro. Again, there’s
                          no confirmed price details from Google at this point in time. With the Pixel Watch only being
                          released in October 2022, we don’t think there will be too much change from the price of that
                          smartwatch: We don’t know the official specs of the Google Pixel Watch 2 yet, so we’re relying on
                          the rumours that have surfaced so far to give us a clue on what we might see when the new model
                          arrives.

                          Yamato-Saidaiji Station in Nara City, Nara Prefecture, Japan.[3][4][5] While delivering a campaign
                          speech for a Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) candidate, he was shot from behind at close range by a
                          man with an improvised firearm.[1] Abe was transported by a medical helicopter to Nara Medical
                          University Hospital in Kashihara, where he was pronounced dead.[6] Leaders from many nations
                          expressed shock and dismay at Abe's assassination,[7] which was the first of a former Japanese
                          prime minister since Saitō Makoto and Takahashi Korekiyo during the February 26 incident in
                          1936.[8] Prime Minister Kishida decided to hold a state funeral for Abe on 27 September.[9] The
                          suspect, 41-year-old Tetsuya Yamagami (Japanese: 山上 徹也), was arrested at the scene for attempted

                          investigators that he had shot Abe in relation to a grudge he held against the Unification Church
                          (UC), to which Abe and his family had political ties, over his mother's bankruptcy in 2002.

                          82][3][83] At 2:45 pm, a press conference was held by Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, who stated that
                          Abe was in critical condition and that "doctors [were] doing everything they [could]".[84] Abe's
                          wife Akie arrived at the hospital at 4:55 pm.[85] Despite doctors' efforts, Abe was pronounced dead
                          at the hospital at 5:03 pm, around five and a half hours after being shot.[6][86][87] He was 67
                          years old. Hidetada Fukushima, a doctor at the hospital, said the cause of Abe's death was blood
                          loss, despite four hours of blood transfusions that saw the administration of 100 units of
                          blood.[b][89][90] Fukushima said that Abe was hit by two bullets[91] and that one bullet was not
                          found in Abe's body.[92] The police autopsy concluded Abe died from loss of blood after a bullet
                          damaged an artery under his collarbone.[93] Several hours after the assassination, both former
                          prime minister Yoshihide Suga[94] and Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno visited the hospital
                          where Abe's body was being held.[95] The body was subject to a judicial autopsy and departed from
                          the hospital with Abe's widow at 5:55 a.m. on 9 July.

  - Source              :
                          (Kyodo News via AP) TOKYO (AP) — Japanese prosecutors formally charged the suspect in the
                          assassination of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe with murder, sending him to stand trial, a court
                          said Friday. Tetsuya Yamagami was arrested immediately after allegedly shooting Abe with a homemade
                          gun as the former leader was making a campaign speech in July outside a train station in Nara in
                          western Japan. He then underwent a nearly six-month mental evaluation, which prosecutors said
                          showed he is fit to stand trial. Yamagami was also charged with violating a gun control law,
                          according to the Nara District Court. Police have said Yamagami told them that he killed Abe, one
                          of Japan’s most influential and divisive politicians, because of Abe’s apparent links to a
                          religious group that he hated. In his statements and in social media postings attributed to him,
                          Yamagami said he developed a grudge because his mother had made massive donations to the
                          Unification Church that bankrupted his family and ruined his life. One of his lawyers, Masaaki
                          Furukawa, told The Associated Press on Thursday that Yamagami will have to take responsibility for
                          the serious consequences of his alleged actions and that his defense lawyers will do their best to
                          reduce his sentence. Japanese law allows capital punishment for murder, but experts say the death
                          penalty usually is handed down for multiple killings and Yamagami could get life in prison if
                          convicted.

                          House of the Dragon. Photograph by Ollie Upton / HBO We’ve rounded the halfway point on House of
                          the Dragon season 1, HBO’s much-hyped Game of Thrones prequel series. House of the Dragon will
                          feature a large time jump between Episodes 5 and 6; when the dust settles, a bunch of major
                          characters will be played by different actors, and the realm will be a very different place. The
                          floodgates are beginning to open and we are finding out more and more about the last five episodes
                          of season 1. HBO now has Episodes 6-10 listed on their official schedule, complete with runtimes.
                          In addition, Rotten Tomatoes‘ series page for the show has episode titles listed. We’re going to
                          lay it all out below, with the slight caveat that since the Rotten Tomatoes episode titles have not
                          been officially confirmed by HBO, they must be taken with a grain of salt. The only episode title
                          HBO has confirmed is for Episode 6. While the episode titles aren’t confirmed by HBO, it’s still
                          enough to get us pretty excited. “The Lord of the Tides” refers to the head of House Velaryon; why
                          will that be so relevant during the longest episode of the season? Then there’s “The Green Council.

                          Ireland, with most scenes shot on location in Derry and some in Belfast. Although the plot lines of
                          Derry Girls are fictional, the series frequently references actual events of the Troubles and the
                          Northern Ireland peace process, including the 1994 IRA ceasefire announcement, the 1995 visit to
                          Northern Ireland of President Bill Clinton and First Lady Hillary Clinton, and the Good Friday
                          referendum of 1998.

                          At a news conference at the Paris offices of her publisher, Gallimard, Ernaux, 82, promised to keep
                          writing. “To receive the Nobel Prize is, for me, a responsibility to continue,” she said. She felt
                          compelled, in particular, to keep examining the inequality and struggles that women face. “Speaking
                          from my condition as a woman,” she said, “it does not seem to me that we, women, have become equal
                          in freedom, in power.” Ernaux becomes only the 17th woman to have been awarded the prize, which has
                          been given to 119 writers since it was formed in 1901. She is the second woman to receive the prize
                          in three years after Louise Glück, the American poet, was given 2020’s award. While early on in her
                          career Ernaux wrote autobiographical fiction, she quickly cast off any pretense that she was
                          inventing a plot and began writing memoirs, though she has often resisted labeling her work as
                          either fiction or nonfiction. “Everything she writes, every word, is literal and factually true,”
                          said Dan Simon, the founder of Seven Stories Press, which has been publishing Ernaux in English for
                          31 years. “And yet these are tremendous works of the imagination.

                          Max Verstappen won a chaotic, rain-shortened Japanese Grand Prix to seal his second Formula 1 world
                          championship amid huge confusion. After a race where only 29 of the 53 scheduled laps were
                          completed due to heavy rain at Suzuka, Verstappen was crowned champion after a five-second penalty
                          for Charles Leclerc dropped him to second behind Sergio Perez. "The first one is a little more
                          emotional, the second one is more beautiful," said Verstappen, who romped clear from Leclerc and
                          Perez's battles to win by over 20 seconds despite the tricky conditions and lack of laps. "That was
                          worthy of winning a world championship," said Jenson Button of his drive. Please use Chrome browser

                          points would be awarded for the race, as most believed only 19 points would be awarded due to less
                          than 75 per cent of the laps being completed. But for the Japanese GP there was a different
                          interpretation of the rules, which state that the reduced points are only applied if a race is
                          suspended "and cannot be resumed".

                          Developed by daily Fantasy pro and SportsLine predictive data engineer Mike McClure, this
                          proprietary Formula 1 prediction model simulates every race 10,000 times, taking into account
                          factors such as track history and recent results. It's had a strong history of success in
                          motorsports, correctly predicting seven winners during the 2021 NASCAR season and its projected
                          leaderboards have forecasted winners across multiple racing formats. The model has been scorching
                          hot when it comes to picking Formula 1 race events dating back to 2021. It nailed both of Leclerc's
                          wins in 2022, and at the 2021 Mexican Grand Prix, the model was strongly backing Verstappen as its
                          top pick. The result: Verstappen dominated the field and ran away with a surprise victory. The
                          model followed that up by calling Verstappen's win at the Rolex Emilia Romagna GP in April and then
                          nailed his wins again each of the last two weeks in Belgium and the Netherlands. Anyone who
                          followed the model's lead on those plays has seen huge returns Now, the model has dialed in on the
                          2022 Formula 1 Japanese Grand Prix and just released its coveted picks and leaderboard projections.
                          You can head to SportsLine now to see the complete 2022 Japanese GP leaderboard projection. One
                          massive shocker: McClure is fading Perez even though he's the fourth favorite for the 2022 Japanese
                          Grand Prix at 11-1.

                          It’s barely worth it to resell these cards right now, and with only 281 GPUs sold in 3 weeks, the
                          demand is scarce. The average sale price has also been gradually trending lower ever since launch.

                          models are just $50 shy of hitting the recommended list price of the 4090 — by default, without any
                          scalper tax. It almost feels like people would just rather buy the RTX 4090 instead. Having looked
                          at the eBay sales numbers for both GPUs, I can tell you one thing — the RTX 4090 doesn’t seem to
                          have slowed down just because the RTX 4080 launched. On the contrary, it benefited from the
                          release. While the RTX 4080 appears to be selling at a snail’s pace and scalpers are desperate to
                          get rid of it, the 4090 thrives, and it’s still a catch at MSRP. Considering the vast chasm of
                          performance between the two, the 4090 remains a better deal if caught at the recommended price of
                          $1,600, however expensive that might be.

                          league and create a historic moment.[5] In December 2006, it was reported that Martin Guigui had
                          been working on a biopic project about the career of Nat Clifton for the last ten years.[8] The
                          project by Sunset Pictures was reported by Variety to begin production in April 2007 with Guigui
                          directing from a screenplay he wrote.[9] Henry Simmons was attached to play Nat Clifton and Richard
                          Dreyfuss to portray Abe Saperstein, the owner and founder of the Harlem Globetrotters. Romeo Miller
                          had also signed on to play a younger Clifton.

Question 186              : When did the Google Pixel Watch start sell?
Correct Answers         :  
                          October 13, Oct 13, Oct. 13, 13 October, 13 Oct, 13 Oct.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - Answer              :  October 13, 2022,
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          This makes the Pixel Watch a bit more affordable than the Apple Watch Series 8 ($399) but pricier
                          than the Galaxy Watch 5 ($279) and recently-released Fitbit Sense 2 ($299). (See the rest of the
                          differences between the Google Pixel Watch vs. Fitbit Sense 2.) The Pixel Watch release date was
                          October 13, 2022, and since then we're continuing to track the best Pixel Watch deals. Note that
                          the Pixel Watch launched alongside the Google Pixel 7 and Google Pixel 7 Pro, which would both make
                          ideal companion devices for the company's smartwatch. The Google Pixel Watch is a simple-looking
                          smartwatch, I might even call it minimalistic. It comes in just one size: 41mm. Those with larger
                          wrists might complain about the lack of a larger option; that said, it fit me perfectly. The face
                          features a rounded design with a 3D glass dome. This raised effect distracts from the display's
                          thick bezel, but doesn't change the fact that a good chunk of the display is unusable. Perhaps my
                          prior experience with Samsung watches is to blame? I can't help but think it's a missed opportunity
                          to incorporate in digital rotating bezel in that space. It seems like no mistake that the Pixel
                          Watch is a "dark mode" device. The interface and all of Google's watch faces have black backgrounds
                          to further conceal the bezel.

                          prospectpark.org Oct 18, 2022 By Brooklyn Magazine Prospect Park Alliance has named Morgan Monaco
                          as its new president and park administrator, filling a position left open eight months ago after
                          her predecessor, Sue Donoghue, was tapped to run NYC Parks. Described as a “longtime New York City
                          public servant,” Monaco was chosen her for her “extensive knowledge of park equity and community
                          development” by the Alliance and NYC Parks. The 38-year-old is also the alliance’s first Black
                          president. Monaco has deep Brooklyn ties, most recently as the executive director of the Red Hook
                          Initiative, a community organization that serves the roughly 6,500 residents living in the
                          borough’s largest public house development. Prior to that, she worked in the city’s mayor’s office
                          of operations holding various roles. “As a born-and-raised New Yorker whose first high school
                          internship was with NYC Parks, it is a dream come true to be able to steward one of the most
                          significant parks in our city,” Monaco said in a press release. Monaco, who currently lives in
                          Windsor Terrace, plans to leverage her past non-profit experience in the new role, with the release
                          stating that she’s exploring ways to bring more “social services to the park” and more programs
                          focused on health, wellness and other services that help residents thrive.

                          Advertisement Supported by By Lisa W. Foderaro The Prospect Park Alliance, the nonprofit group that
                          raises money for and oversees the daily operation of Brooklyn’s most visited park, has appointed a
                          former New York City parks official as its new president. Sue Donoghue, who oversaw Mayor Michael
                          R. Bloomberg’s sustainability and parks blueprint known as PlaNYC, succeeds Emily Lloyd, who left
                          to lead the city’s Department of Environmental Protection for Mayor Bill de Blasio. Ms. Donoghue
                          lives a block from the park. “With three kids, the park is a big part of our daily existence,” said
                          Ms. Donoghue, whose appointment was approved by the alliance’s board on Tuesday evening. “It’s our
                          backyard and front yard.” The Prospect Park Alliance, founded in 1987, was one of the first
                          conservancies that set out to transform a long-neglected park. (The Central Park Conservancy began

                          prospectpark.org Oct 18, 2022 By Brooklyn Magazine Prospect Park Alliance has named Morgan Monaco
                          as its new president and park administrator, filling a position left open eight months ago after
                          her predecessor, Sue Donoghue, was tapped to run NYC Parks. Described as a “longtime New York City
                          public servant,” Monaco was chosen her for her “extensive knowledge of park equity and community
                          development” by the Alliance and NYC Parks. The 38-year-old is also the alliance’s first Black
                          president. Monaco has deep Brooklyn ties, most recently as the executive director of the Red Hook
                          Initiative, a community organization that serves the roughly 6,500 residents living in the
                          borough’s largest public house development. Prior to that, she worked in the city’s mayor’s office
                          of operations holding various roles. “As a born-and-raised New Yorker whose first high school
                          internship was with NYC Parks, it is a dream come true to be able to steward one of the most
                          significant parks in our city,” Monaco said in a press release. Monaco, who currently lives in
                          Windsor Terrace, plans to leverage her past non-profit experience in the new role, with the release
                          stating that she’s exploring ways to bring more “social services to the park” and more programs
                          focused on health, wellness and other services that help residents thrive.

                          note 1] The company also teased further games — Project A, a tactical shooter; Project L, a
                          fighting game with League of Legends characters; and Project F, a multiplayer game set in Runeterra
                          – that were not detailed outside of genre descriptions and brief gameplay clips.[28][29] Project A
                          was later revealed to be Valorant, which entered closed beta on April 7, 2020[30] and was
                          officially released on June 2, 2020.[31] In December 2019, Riot Games announced Riot Forge, a
                          publishing label headed by Leanne Loombe. The label partners with smaller game development studios
                          for the creation of League of Legends games, with some games of this type already being in
                          development.[32] Two titles from Riot Forge were announced at The Game Awards 2019: Ruined King: A
                          League of Legends Story by Airship Syndicate, and Convergence: A League of Legends Story by Double
                          Stallion Games.[33] Another division, Riot Tabletop, was announced in January 2020, to producing
                          tabletop games; the first was Tellstones: King's Gambit, released in 2020.[34] Riot acquired
                          Hypixel Studios in April 2020, which they had been investing in over the previous eighteen months
                          to help them publish Hytale, a voxel-based sandbox game.[35] Also in April, Riot announced plans to
                          establish a Singapore office later that year.

                          on Rising Thunder and Stonehearth at the time.[21] Rising Thunder was effectively canceled
                          following the acquisition, with the game's team allocated to a new project.[22] On October 13,
                          2017, Beck and Merrill announced that they were returning their focus to developing games, aiming
                          to create new experiences for video game and esports players.[23] Beck and Merrill handed over the
                          day-to-day operations and overall management of the League of Legends team to three longtime
                          employees: Dylan Jadeja, Scott Gelb, and Nicolo Laurent, who previously served as chief financial
                          officer (CFO), chief technology officer (CTO) and president, respectively.[23] Subsequently, Gelb
                          and Laurent assumed roles as chief operating officer (COO) and chief executive officer (CEO),
                          respectively, while Beck and Merrill became the Riot Games' chairmen.[24] As of May 2018[update],
                          Riot Games employed 2,500 people,[25] operating 24 offices around the world.[26] In October 2019,

                          consoles called League of Legends: Wild Rift, a standalone mobile version of the Teamfight Tactics
                          mode from League of Legends, and the digital collectible card game titled Legends of Runeterra,

                          its new chief executive officer. Apollo Management Group, which recently bought the ailing search
                          engine for $5 billion, announced Friday that Jim Lanzone will be Yahoo’s new CEO as of September
                          27. He’s succeeding Guru Gowrappan, who has led Yahoo since 2018 and will now shift to a senior
                          adviser role. The move comes just four months after Verizon announced it would sell Yahoo to Apollo
                          for $5 billion. Lanzone has been the CEO of Tinder for about a year and helped revamp the popular

                          has also held executive roles at IAC. “With his experience and proven management skills, we are
                          confident Jim is the right leader to steward Yahoo through a transformational new phase that can

                          in the user experience and develop exciting new offerings that can build on its premier brands in
                          sports, finance, news, technology and more.” Verizon sale of Yahoo to Apollo is a deal that also

                          completely reorganized the company.[51] On May 13, 2012, Thompson was fired and was replaced on an
                          interim basis by Ross Levinsohn, recently appointed head of Yahoo's new Media group. Several

                          Enterprise and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply. Netflix added 2.41 million
                          global subscribers in the third quarter of 2022, bringing its grand total to 223.09 million (73.39
                          million from the U.S. and Canada), a gain of +4.5 percent over the prior year’s comparable quarter.
                          Q3 was the first quarter of 2022 when Netflix didn’t lose subs. According to Tuesday’s shareholder
                          letter, executives at Netflix believe they’ll add 4.50 million subs globally in the final quarter
                          of 2022. The streamer added 4.38 million subs in the year-ago quarter, which at the time
                          represented 9.4 percent growth. So we’re not there — but we are well above the company’s tempered
                          expectations; at the end of Q2, Netflix forecasted that it would add 1 million global subscribers
                          in Q3. Clearly, it bested that — the same goes for its financial forecasts. Netflix earned $3.10
                          per share in the third quarter on $7.926 billion in revenue; its net income was $1.398 billion.
                          Wall Street forecasted earnings of $2.13 per share on $7.84 billion in revenue. Back on July 19,
                          Netflix itself estimated Q3 earnings per share of $2.

                          new episode 4 of Chicago PD’s current season 10. It turns out that the writers decided to name it,
                          “DONDE VIVES.” It sounds like episode 4 will feature some more very scandalous, intense, dramatic,
                          interesting, action-filled and suspenseful scenes. In the new episode 4, a shocking murder and a

Question 193              : How much does the YouTube Premium family plan cost now?

                          Is YouTube Premium worth it? Here's what the subscription plan offers and whether you should sign
                          up for YouTube Premium. If you love watching videos on YouTube, you might have considered
                          subscribing to YouTube Premium. But is YouTube Premium worth it? Let's take a look at what YouTube
                          Premium offers, what you should know about the service, and how to decide if it's worthwhile for
                          you. YouTube Premium (formerly YouTube Red) costs $11.99 per month, after a one-month free trial.
                          If you're sure about the service and want to commit for a year, there's an annual plan available
                          for $119.99. That's two months of savings for paying upfront. There are also two other plans
                          available for families and students. The Family plan for YouTube Premium costs $22.99 per month. It
                          allows you to add up to five other people (six total members) who are at least 13 years old and
                          live in your household so they get the same benefits. Per YouTube's terms, these people must live
                          at the same address as you. If you're a student who can provide verification (required each year),
                          the price of the Student YouTube Premium plan is $6.99 per month instead. Whether the cost of
                          Premium is worth it or not depends on how many of YouTube Premium's benefits you use. Keep this in
                          mind as we look at them below, especially in relation to what other services like Spotify Premium
                          and Netflix offer.

                          In working with McCreary, Hozier said they were able to find a balance so that the song was "not
                          too elegiac, not too much of an elegy, not too sweet, not too lullaby-esque, not too outrageously
                          doom and gloom, and not too absolutely metal". Paolo Ragusa of Consequence described the song as "a
                          daring, cinematic number that hits at all the thematic notes of God of War: Ragnarök, and finds
                          Hozier using his signature velvety tone to evoke both tenderness and awe".[59] Hozier and McCreary
                          performed the song live at The Game Awards on December 8, 2022.[60] God of War Ragnarök was
                          released worldwide on November 9, 2022, for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.[41] Players who
                          purchase the PS4 version can upgrade to the PS5 version for US$10. In addition to the standard base
                          game (physical and digital), there are three special editions: the Jötnar Edition, the Collector's
                          Edition, and the Digital Deluxe Edition. Early copies of the base game were also marketed as a
                          Launch Edition and included the Risen Snow Armor and Tunic skins for Kratos and Atreus,
                          respectively, which are also included with the three special editions. Pre-orders for all versions
                          opened on July 15, 2022.[61]

                          definitely reminded me of shows I grew up watching like Thomas the Tank Engine. I’m curious how
                          this show came about? Michael G. Stern: DC and Warner Bros. Animation had wanted to find a way to
                          connect young kids to their heroes and they had sort of been struggling to do it. They brought me

                          Profile Sections tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News LONDON — Rishi Sunak took office as
                          British prime minister Tuesday, acknowledging the mistakes of his Conservative Party predecessors
                          and warning of difficult decisions ahead for a country mired in political and economic trouble. The
                          former finance minister is now the United Kingdom's third leader in seven weeks, following the
                          collapse of Boris Johnson's scandal-plagued government and the light-speed implosion of Liz Truss.
                          Sunak, the first British Asian to assume the role and a multimillionaire former banker, paid
                          passing tribute to those predecessors in his first speech as leader Tuesday. But he also
                          acknowledged “mistakes were made” under Truss, and promised to lead with “integrity,
                          professionalism and accountability” — three qualities Johnson is widely perceived as lacking. “Our
                          country is facing a profound economic crisis,” Sunak said in his first speech as prime minister
                          outside No. 10 Downing St. “I will unite our country not with words but with action.” Sunak’s
                          leadership was confirmed when he met King Charles III at Buckingham Palace and was invited to form
                          a government by the new monarch, a ceremonial rubber-stamping act known as “kissing hands.” Truss
                          became the 15th prime minister of Queen Elizabeth II’s reign just 49 days ago — the shortest term
                          in British political history. Now each of their successors stands in their place, a mark of the
                          tumult that has beset the world’s sixth-largest economy.

                          streaming giant on Thursday is rolling out its cheapest membership tier, dubbed "Basic With Ads."
                          The new tier will cost $6.99 per month, which makes it a full $3 cheaper than Netflix's current
                          cheapest plan, the $9.99 Basic plan. It's Netflix's first foray into the ad-supported space — the
                          streamer has for years resisted putting any advertising on its platform. The company's plan arrives
                          on Nov. 3, a month before rival streaming service Disney+ will introduce its own ad-supported tier,
                          and competes with ad-supported plans from services like Hulu and Peacock. The plan's launch comes
                          as Netflix is preparing to crack down on password sharing on its platform. Beginning next year,
                          Netflix will push people who borrow accounts to create their own, and will also give
                          account-holders who share their passwords the ability to pay extra to have friends and family on
                          their accounts. Here's what you need to know about Netflix's Basic With Ads tier. The Basic With
                          Ads plan will operate similarly to the Basic plan. Users will have access to a 720p video stream —
                          versus the 1080p stream offered by the $15.49 Standard plan and the 4K plan offered by the $19.99
                          Premium plan — which can be accessed from any internet-connected device.

                          Like many of you, I find Netflix occupies my television screen about once every two weeks since I’m
                          not champing at the bit to experience a litany of identical documentaries focused on minor Twitter
                          story lines from the previous year. (Seriously, how the hell are there two GameStonk
                          documentaries?) In short, Netflix isn’t something I want to spend $240 on each year anymore — its
                          salad days are a distant memory — and the company is finally starting to empathize with my
                          reasoning. Basic With Ads is functionally identical to Netflix’s $10 Basic plan. You’re capped at a
                          720p resolution for all of your playback options and are allowed to use only one device on the
                          subscription at a time. (So no, you can’t engineer some sort of weird multi-apartment Bridgerton
                          marathon.) The only sacrifice you need to make to get the $3 discount is to sit through the four
                          minutes of total advertising time that occupied, say, season one, episode two of Stranger Things,
                          which I fired up on my Roku for a test-drive. (Yes, I’m a little late to the Upside Down party.)
                          The first thing I saw on my television was a dewy, luxurious promo for Louis Vuitton, which frankly
                          read as a pointed barb to my newfound money-saving mind-set. Yes, Netflix believes that even those
                          pivoting to Basic With Ads can afford the good life.

                          In the photos, taken at Dunsfold Aerodrome, Elizabeth Debicki’s Diana sports the late royal’s
                          iconic coif, as well as a floral midi dress. On November 5, 2021, Debicki was photographed wearing
                          a recreation of Princess Diana’s famous “revenge dress,” which she wore to the 1994 Vanity Fair
                          dinner at the Serpentine Gallery in London. That evening coincided with the airing of a documentary
                          featuring an interview that Prince Charles had with Jonathan Dimbleby, in which he admitted to
                          being unfaithful to Diana with Camilla Parker. Diana had bought the dress in 1991, but didn’t dare
                          to wear it at the time—an off-the-shoulder dress is against Royal protocol. The dress was perceived
                          by some as a form of vengeance against Prince Charles and his family. Finally, mere weeks before

Correct Answers         :  
                          Sicily

                          5] The series was created, written and directed by Mike White. White also serves as executive
                          producer alongside David Bernad and Nick Hall.[35] In an interview with Ben Travers of IndieWire at
                          the 2021 ATX Television Festival, White explained his creative inspiration for the first season.
                          White wished to explore the question of "how money can pervert even our most intimate
                          relationships," to examine the "ethics of vacationing in other people's realities," and to present
                          the "flesh and blood" experience of being gripped by the power dynamics of "today's culture
                          wars".[36] Cristobal Tapia de Veer is the series' composer and Ben Kutchins is the cinematographer

                          consists of seven episodes and is titled The White Lotus: Sicily.[39] White initially envisioned
                          the second season taking place in a political setting, such as a Bilderberg conference, but
                          scrapped this idea and chose Italy instead.[40] White said regarding this choice, "The kind of
                          mythology of Sicily, at least from the point of view of Americans, is the archetypal sexual
                          politics and role play that you associate with, like, opera and the mafia and Italian romance.

                          It’s the type of series that may make you second-guess any of your intended vacation plans. 2022
                          was truly the year when the wealthy were held accountable, at least in movies and television.
                          Between Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery, White Noise, and Triangle of Sadness, we got a ton of
                          great content that forced the upper class to have traumatic vacations. The pinnacle of this was the
                          second season of The White Lotus, which moved the miniseries to a luxurious new location in Italy.
                          Unfortunately for the characters, this had more in common with the Italian scenery of The Talented
                          Mr. Ripley than it did with Under The Tuscan Sun. As with the first season, the end of this trip is
                          teased at the very beginning, and it’s a violent one. Both seasons of The White Lotus take place at
                          individual locations in a luxury vacation resort chain. A multitude of guests (most of whom are
                          incredibly wealthy) interact with the staff and local residents, only to begin squabbling and
                          bringing up past issues. While the show’s brilliance stems from the inventive storytelling of
                          writer/director Mike White, it doesn’t hurt that the show has the budget and scale of an HBO
                          production. In order to make the series as authentic as possible, White and his production team
                          utilized several real locations in both seasons. The White Lotus has drawn critical acclaim due to
                          how close its satire feels to reality, and the believability extends to the filming locations
                          themselves.

                          Mark Kelly Democratic Mark Kelly Democratic The 2022 United States Senate election in Arizona was
                          held on November 8, 2022, to elect a member of the United States Senate to represent the state of
                          Arizona. The seat was previously held by Republican John McCain, who won his final term in 2016.
                          McCain died on August 25, 2018, and Governor Doug Ducey appointed former U.S. Senator Jon Kyl to
                          fill the seat. Kyl resigned at the end of that year and Ducey replaced him with Martha McSally, who
                          then lost to Democrat Mark Kelly in 2020. Primaries in Arizona took place on August 2. Kelly won
                          renomination without opposition, while venture capitalist Blake Masters won the Republican
                          nomination against a large field of candidates. Although Arizona typically leans Republican, Kelly
                          led Masters by low single digits in aggregate polling. Kelly held a significant fundraising
                          advantage until many Republican-aligned groups began spending to assist Masters in the final weeks
                          of the campaign.[1] On November 1, Libertarian nominee Marc Victor dropped out of the race and
                          endorsed Masters.[2][3][4] Incumbent Democrat Mark Kelly won reelection, defeating Republican
                          nominee Blake Masters by a comfortable margin.[5] This was the first time Democrats won a full term
                          to this seat since 1962. The race was competitive and seen as crucial to determining party control

Question 202              : which party controls the house after 2022 midterm elections?
Correct Answers         :  
                          Republican 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prediction (only positive):
  - Answer              :  Republicans.
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          Watch now.] All 435 House seats were up for election in the 2022 midterm race. The Cook Political
                          Report with Amy Walter rated 36 races as toss-ups. A shift in five seats was the determining factor
                          as to whether the chamber would go to Republicans. Midterm elections historically hurt the
                          president’s party. In 18 of the last 20 elections the president’s party lost ground in the House.
                          Redistricting played a significant role in the 2022 House elections. New lines altered the
                          competitiveness in numerous districts, and some incumbents ran for re-election in the new
                          territory. After the 2020 Census, state legislatures or commissions drew congressional district
                          lines. Both parties filed lawsuits to challenge these new maps. Republicans controlled line-drawing
                          in far more districts than Democrats and, as a result, gained more seats in the House from
                          redistricting alone. Midterms are generally viewed as a referendum on the president. With low
                          approval ratings and high inflation, the Biden administration’s politics, policies, and polling
                          shaped the national atmosphere. The results of the 2022 midterms held true to form, with the
                          opposing party gaining House majority. In the final months before Election Day, the National
                          Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) raised about $113.2 million, in contrast to the
                          Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee’s (DCCC) $110.7 million.

                          typical positive association between approval and seat loss/gain in both the House and Senate. In
                          both instances the correlation is moderately strong: r= 0.61 for the House, r = 0.45 for the
                          Senate. From 1936-2018, near the midterms, six presidents have had approval ratings in the range of
                          40-45%--like Biden. Those cases involved wide variation in seat loss or gain. The range of outcomes
                          in the Senate was between -9 and +2 seats. The average was a loss of 4. In the House, presidents
                          with approval between 40-45%, saw their party lose between 63 and 13 seats, with an average loss of
                          36 seats. There have been no instances of House seat gains for Presidents with approval as low as
                          Biden’s. Seats to Defend: This year the Democrats defend 222 seats in the House and 14 in the
                          Senate.

                          Watch now.] All 435 House seats were up for election in the 2022 midterm race. The Cook Political
                          Report with Amy Walter rated 36 races as toss-ups. A shift in five seats was the determining factor
                          as to whether the chamber would go to Republicans. Midterm elections historically hurt the
                          president’s party. In 18 of the last 20 elections the president’s party lost ground in the House.
                          Redistricting played a significant role in the 2022 House elections. New lines altered the
                          competitiveness in numerous districts, and some incumbents ran for re-election in the new
                          territory. After the 2020 Census, state legislatures or commissions drew congressional district
                          lines. Both parties filed lawsuits to challenge these new maps. Republicans controlled line-drawing
                          in far more districts than Democrats and, as a result, gained more seats in the House from
                          redistricting alone. Midterms are generally viewed as a referendum on the president. With low
                          approval ratings and high inflation, the Biden administration’s politics, policies, and polling
                          shaped the national atmosphere. The results of the 2022 midterms held true to form, with the
                          opposing party gaining House majority. In the final months before Election Day, the National
                          Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) raised about $113.2 million, in contrast to the
                          Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee’s (DCCC) $110.7 million.

                          NevadaToday Nevada Election Survey Project poll finds 52% of Nevadans plan to vote for Cortez Masto
                          As Nevadans begin voting in the 2022 midterm election, a new University of Nevada, Reno poll of
                          likely voters released today finds Catherine Cortez Masto leading in the race for U.S. senator and
                          Steve Sisolak leading in the governor’s race. The governor’s race is within the margin of error,
                          but the senate race is not. The Nevada Election Survey Project 2022 general election poll, which
                          asked nearly 600 likely Nevada voters about their voting intentions and views on state and national
                          officials, found 52% of Nevadans plan to vote for Cortez Masto, 39% for Adam Laxalt and 5% remain
                          undecided. Cortez Masto’s large lead reflects less Republican voter enthusiasm for Laxalt’s
                          candidacy compared to Joe Lombardo and other Republican candidates. Among likely Republican voters,
                          74% said they planned to support Laxalt, compared to 83% for Lombardo and 88% for their Republican
                          House of Representatives candidate. More Republicans also plan to support Cortez Masto than other
                          Democrats on the ballot. Even if this sample of Nevadans is unusually supportive of the incumbent
                          senator, lower support among any likely Republican voters for Laxalt, in what others have polled as
                          a very tight race, is noteworthy.

                          cheeky sparkle in her eye and is sharp as a razor. From the moment she walked into the room she
                          captured all of our attention with her effervescence and then solidified that attention with the

                          Mexico remain winless after their first two matches at the 2022 FIFA World Cup, following up their
                          0-0 draw with Poland by losing 2-0 to Argentina on Saturday. El Tri find themselves dead last in
                          Group C, but still with a realistic chance to advance when they face off against Saudi Arabia on
                          Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET. Still, there are big issues, mainly not being able to score a goal in 180
                          minutes of action. To advance, Mexico have to win and see the Poland vs. Argentina match go their
                          way, but it's complicated. What are the scenarios facing Tata Martino's side in a do-or-die battle
                          against the confident Saudis? Here's what to know: · Win and have Poland beat Argentina: This is
                          the most straightforward route to the round of 16. A win over Saudi Arabia combined with Poland
                          beating Argentina will be enough for Martino's team to advance. There would be no need to factor in
                          any sort of goal differential in this scenario. · Win and have Argentina beat or tie Poland while
                          securing a superior goal differential: This is where it gets crazy. Mexico have to win regardless,
                          but if they can win and boost their goal differential, they could potentially sneak past Argentina
                          or Poland (depending on how that games if finishes).

                          Mexico remain winless after their first two matches at the 2022 FIFA World Cup, following up their
                          0-0 draw with Poland by losing 2-0 to Argentina on Saturday. El Tri find themselves dead last in
                          Group C, but still with a realistic chance to advance when they face off against Saudi Arabia on
                          Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET. Still, there are big issues, mainly not being able to score a goal in 180
                          minutes of action. To advance, Mexico have to win and see the Poland vs. Argentina match go their
                          way, but it's complicated. What are the scenarios facing Tata Martino's side in a do-or-die battle
                          against the confident Saudis? Here's what to know: · Win and have Poland beat Argentina: This is
                          the most straightforward route to the round of 16. A win over Saudi Arabia combined with Poland
                          beating Argentina will be enough for Martino's team to advance. There would be no need to factor in
                          any sort of goal differential in this scenario. · Win and have Argentina beat or tie Poland while
                          securing a superior goal differential: This is where it gets crazy. Mexico have to win regardless,
                          but if they can win and boost their goal differential, they could potentially sneak past Argentina
                          or Poland (depending on how that games if finishes).

                          21. Notably missing from the cast list is fan favorite Matthew Gray Gubler, who will not be
                          returning as genius FBI Special Agent Dr. Spencer Reid in the first batch of episodes. He and
                          Season 13 addition Daniel Henney (Special Agent Matt Simmons) couldn't make their schedules work to
                          be series regulars for this season, but the door is open for them to return in the future.
                          Showrunner Erica Messer said that Spencer and Matt are mysteriously absent but "not forgotten" this
                          season, according to TV Line. "Dr. Reid's and I believe Matt Simmons' desks are still there, still
                          have stuff on it…," she said. "Like, if any of you went back [to the office after the pandemic],
                          you still have stuff on your desk that was there for two years. So we're definitely playing that.
                          But [Spencer and Matt] are not gone gone." Hopefully they'll be back for Season 2. This fresh new
                          series will pick up where the original left off and is set in post-Covid-19 times. Unlike the cable
                          TV show, the streaming version will follow one storyline across the whole season, instead of a new
                          case in each episode. The official logline says the FBI's elite team of criminal profilers will
                          come up against their greatest threat yet, an unsub named Elias Voit who has used the pandemic to
                          build a network of other serial killers.

                          football head coach. Athletic Director Trev Alberts made the announcement Saturday morning,
                          following Nebraska's close win over the Iowa Hawkeyes Friday. Rhule signed an 8-year contract to
                          take over the struggling Nebraska football program. He will be formally introduced in a news
                          conference Monday at Memorial Stadium. In a news release Saturday morning, Alberts pointed to

                          a program and made him an ideal fit at Nebraska." Rhule was most recently the head coach for the
                          NFL Carolina Panthers team, where he was released after a 1-4 start. He's credited for improving
                          the football programs at both Baylor and Temple while serving as a head coach. While coaching at
                          Temple from 2013 to 2016, Rhule and the Owls won 28 games. The head coach took the Owls from a
                          2-win season in 2013 to racking up a 10-4 record in 2015. In his last season with Temple, Rhule led
                          the team to a 10-3 record and an American Athletic Conference championship — the first football
                          conference title in 49 years for the school.

                          South Korean K-Pop company SM Entertainment is expanding its presence in Southeast Asia with plans
                          to set up its headquarters in the region in Singapore where it is also looking to launch its retail
                          business. The plan was confirmed by the entertainment firm to CNBC on December 1. SM Entertainment
                          founder Lee Soo-man told The CNBC Conversation last month that the plan could see the creation of a
                          new K-Pop group called NCT Singapore, although it is unclear if it could come to fruition. Lee, who
                          is about to get a feature documentary about his life, told the news outlet in November that SM
                          Entertainment is recruiting and producing talent through the “Culture Technology” (or CT) system
                          that he developed where potential singers and dancers go through four stages: casting, training,
                          marketing/management and producing. “SM’s [production method] has become a model for producing
                          K-Pop, and SM’s CT will expand to become [the] CT of the world. The Future of Culture Technology is
                          the fundamental vision [of] SM Entertainment. And now, I am building a new cultural ecosystem by
                          evolving CT from a culture-making technology to a cultural ecosystem-making technology,” Lee said
                          in a speech at Stanford University in May. Lee is often credited for bringing K-Pop to the world’s
                          stage.

                          addition to the new complex, SM partnered with Jongro Haneul Education [ko] to launch SM Institute,
                          an educational facility to train local and international aspiring artists; the institute is
                          expected to open in March 2021.[80] On June 12, it was announced that SM partnered with Seoul
                          Philharmonic Orchestra to release orchestral versions of their artists' most popular songs under
                          the label SM Classics.[81][82] In October 2020, SM announced that Aespa, their first new girl group
                          in six years, would debut with their digital single "Black Mamba" on November 17.[83][84] On May 7,

                          U.S.-based K-pop group.[85] On December 27, 2021, SM announced the creation of their rotational
                          all-female supergroup Girls On Top. The group's first lineup, Got the Beat, consists of BoA,

                          Carr: I hope I'm not being too much of a homer here, but I like the USA double chance at -125. The
                          Dutch weren't impressive despite seven points in the group stage, getting outshot by 10 and
                          accumulating only 2.4 expected goals. Having Memphis Depay back in the lineup helps, but the US
                          outplayed a better England side, so I'll take the US to at least get this to extra time. Daniel

                          take 0-0 after 90 minutes. Dalen Cuff: Unlike Paul, I am being a homer here, but I think I'm
                          justified. This Dutch team is not a dominant squad.

                          This US team has talent and have bossed games this tournament, most notably against England. I like
                          the US to advance at +180. However, I do think this is going to be a tight affair especially in the
                          first half. I like 0-0 in the 1st half (+145). Round of 16: Argentina (-540) vs. Australia (+1600),
                          Draw (+525) Carr: Australia advanced to the knockout stage, but that doesn't mean they're a
                          particularly good team. Argentina had the third-most expected goals (6.3) and expected goal
                          difference (+5.5) in the group stage, and Australia was 30th with 1.7 expected goals and 31st with
                          a -4.1 goal difference. Also, Argentina have Lionel Messi. I'll gladly lay the 1.5 goals at -160,
                          and I'm tempted by Argentina -2.5 at +170. Thomas: This has to be an Argentina win. So, where can
                          we find some value in this game? I'll take an Angel Di Maria assist at +125. Cuff: There is no
                          value here. I'm not willing to lay the 2.5 in order to get into plus money, so I'm going to pass.

                          inflation has been through the roof? Eggs, butter, toothpaste, you name it. Are you, in fact, the
                          low price leader in most of these categories? CRAIG JELINEK: Well, we believe that we are. Now, I'm
                          sure others out there believe that they are. The proof is what the consumer says. And we believe
                          we're the low price leader. Our markup's about 13%. So any rebate money we get, we pass right on to
                          the consumer. We're a top line company. We drive sales. We're not a margin company. BRIAN SOZZI:
                          Any signs from all the data you are collecting right now that we are past the worst in inflation in
                          this country? CRAIG JELINEK: There's a couple of ways to look at that. I don't know we're past the
                          worst. I believe we are. I felt that we are for the last two or three months because at some point,
                          when you start to see container costs coming from Asia, I think in non-food, the container costs
                          are starting to bring prices down. Because transportation is starting to come down. There's still a
                          shortage of things like eggs. I don't see the egg market deflating at the moment. BRIAN SOZZI:

                          workers and food processors. By Peter Baker WASHINGTON — President Biden announced Thursday that he
                          was investing $36 billion in federal funds to save the pensions of more than 350,000 union workers
                          and retirees, a demonstration of commitment to labor just a week after a rupture over an imposed

                          make the commitment, described by the White House as the largest ever award of federal financial

                          Biden Celebrates $90 Billion Bailout of Private Union Pension Plans President Joe Biden jetted off
                          to Cleveland on Wednesday evening to announce the official launch of a $90 billion bailout of union
                          retirement plans—one that's completely paid for with federal borrowing. The bailout was approved
                          last year as part of the American Rescue Plan, the $1.9 trillion emergency spending bill that was
                          ostensibly meant to combat COVID-19 but included an impressive array of spending that had nothing
                          to do with public health. The bailout will direct funds to more than 200 nearly insolvent
                          multiemployer pension plans, which are established jointly by unions and the private companies that
                          contract with them through collective bargaining agreements. "With today's actions, millions of
                          workers will have the dignified retirement they earned and they deserve," Biden told the cheering
                          crowd at a Cleveland high school. Millions of union workers, that is. If you're not part of that
                          select club, there's no bailout coming your way—even as a sagging economy eats into private
                          retirement savings, inflation makes every saved dollar worth less, and Social Security looms on the
                          brink of insolvency. Oh, and you'll have to pay back (with interest!) the money borrowed to make
                          this bailout (and the rest of the American Rescue Plan) possible. Sounds like a great deal, right?

                          start. His toughness and perseverance helped pull the Frogs out of multiple second-half deficits
                          and without his poise, leadership and production late in games, TCU wouldn’t be in the College
                          Football Playoff. Winning the O’Brien and being a Heisman finalist are both well-deserved honors

                          World Cup 13 Morocco have become the first African team to ever make the semi-finals of the World
                          Cup after their sensational victory over Portugal on Saturday. African countries have been
                          competing at the World Cup since 1934 — Egypt withdrew in 1930 after missing their connecting ship
                          to Uruguay as a result of a storm — and have made a total of 49 appearances in the competition.
                          Advertisement Those appearances have been made up of 13 different countries, from Morocco and
                          Tunisia in the north to South Africa at the very southern tip of the continent. The Athletic takes
                          a look at Africa’s rich history at the World Cup and how each of these teams has fared.

                          Preliminary events were also held in celebration of the World Cup event.[69] All times listed in
                          the table below are in South African Standard Time (UTC+02). All times are South Africa Standard
                          Time (UTC+2). The tournament match schedule was announced in November 2007.[73][74] In the first
                          round, or group stage, the 32 teams were divided into eight groups of four, with each team playing
                          the other three teams in their group once. Teams were awarded three points for a win, one point for
                          a draw and none for a defeat. The top two teams in each group advanced to the round of 16. The
                          South American teams performed strongly, with all five advancing to the round of 16 (four as group
                          winners), and four further advancing to the quarter-finals. However, only Uruguay advanced to the
                          semi-finals. Of the six African teams, only Ghana advanced to the round of 16. South Africa became
                          the first host nation in World Cup history to be eliminated in the first round, despite beating
                          France and drawing with Mexico, while Ghana and Ivory Coast were the only other African teams to
                          win a match. The overall performance of the African teams, in the first World Cup to be hosted on
                          the continent, was judged as disappointing by observers such as Cameroon great Roger Milla.[75]
                          Only six out of the thirteen UEFA teams advanced to the round of 16, a record low since the
                          introduction of this stage in 1986.

Question 228              : Who is the new president of the NCAA?
Correct Answers         :  
                          Charlie Baker
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prediction (only positive):
  - Answer              :  Charlie Baker,
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          By Michael McCann Legal Analyst and Senior Sports Legal Reporter Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker,
                          the newly named president of the NCAA, will take the reins from Mark Emmert in March at a time when
                          the organization and its controversial system of amateurism face existential crises. Baker, a
                          Harvard graduate who played basketball for the Crimson, was elected in 2014 and reelected in 2018.
                          He previously served as CEO of Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates. A popular Republican in a
                          heavily Democratic state, Baker is regarded as a fiscally conservative, socially progressive
                          consensus-builder who is pragmatic and open to reforms and different ideas. That skill set will be
                          helpful as Baker faces daunting challenges at the NCAA. One major issue will be developing an
                          enforceable and lawful policy on name, image and likeness. Under Emmert’s leadership, the NCAA
                          hastily adopted an interim NIL policy in June 2021, days before a set of state NIL statutes were
                          set to go into effect that made it illegal for the NCAA and member schools to punish college
                          athletes for using their right of publicity to sign endorsement deals and enter into sponsorships.
                          The NCAA had hoped Congress would pass a federal NIL bill that would have contained an antitrust
                          exemption, but no bill even made it out of committee. To date, members of Congress have viewed NIL
                          in disparate ways.

                          “I am honored to become the next president of the NCAA, an organization that impacts millions of
                          families and countless communities across this country every day,” said Governor Baker. “The NCAA
                          is confronting complex and significant challenges, but I am excited to get to work as the awesome
                          opportunity college athletics provides to so many students is more than worth the challenge. And
                          for the fans that faithfully fill stadiums, stands and gyms from coast to coast, I am eager to
                          ensure the competitions we all love to follow are there for generations to come. Over the coming
                          months, I will begin working with student-athletes and NCAA members as we modernize college sports
                          to suit today’s world, while preserving its essential value.” As the NCAA strives to enhance the
                          experience of the more than 500,000 young people that compete in college sports each year,
                          student-athletes’ input factored significantly in the development of the president’s job
                          description. “As a student-athlete representative on the search committee, I focused my
                          conversations with Governor Baker around many of the issues that student-athletes face today,” said
                          Isaiah Swann, a former baseball student-athlete at the University of Texas-Dallas and a current
                          second year MD-PhD student at the University of Virginia. “Throughout our discussions, he not only
                          demonstrated a command of the top issues confronting college sports but, more importantly, also
                          displayed empathy, open-mindedness, and a desire to better understand and address student-athletes’
                          perspectives.

                          By Michael McCann Legal Analyst and Senior Sports Legal Reporter Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker,
                          the newly named president of the NCAA, will take the reins from Mark Emmert in March at a time when
                          the organization and its controversial system of amateurism face existential crises. Baker, a
                          Harvard graduate who played basketball for the Crimson, was elected in 2014 and reelected in 2018.
                          He previously served as CEO of Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates. A popular Republican in a
                          heavily Democratic state, Baker is regarded as a fiscally conservative, socially progressive
                          consensus-builder who is pragmatic and open to reforms and different ideas. That skill set will be
                          helpful as Baker faces daunting challenges at the NCAA. One major issue will be developing an
                          enforceable and lawful policy on name, image and likeness. Under Emmert’s leadership, the NCAA
                          hastily adopted an interim NIL policy in June 2021, days before a set of state NIL statutes were
                          set to go into effect that made it illegal for the NCAA and member schools to punish college
                          athletes for using their right of publicity to sign endorsement deals and enter into sponsorships.
                          The NCAA had hoped Congress would pass a federal NIL bill that would have contained an antitrust
                          exemption, but no bill even made it out of committee. To date, members of Congress have viewed NIL
                          in disparate ways.

Question 231              : How much did Avatar: The Way of Water earn in its debut weekend at U.S.?
Correct Answers         :

                          (Photo by Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP) “ Avatar: The Way of Water ” didn’t make quite as big of a
                          splash as many assumed it would, but James Cameron’s big budget spectacle still helped breathe life
                          into the box office this weekend. The sequel earned $134 million from North American theaters and
                          $300.5 million internationally for a $434.5 million global debut, according to studio estimates on
                          Sunday. It tied with “The Batman” as the fourth highest domestic debut of the year, behind “Doctor
                          Strange in the Multiverse of Madness” ( $187.4 million in May ), “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,”
                          ( $181 million in November ) and “Thor: Love and Thunder” ($144.2 million in July). Expectations
                          were enormous for “Avatar 2,” which carried a reported price tag of over $350 million, the pressure
                          of following up the highest grossing film of all time (thanks in part to various re-releases) over
                          a decade later and the daunting task of propping up an exhibition business that’s still far from
                          normal. Everything “Avatar” is oversized, though: the Na’vi characters, the runtime (a staggering
                          three hours and 12 minutes), the technical advancements and the release strategy from 20th Century
                          Studios and The Walt Disney Co. Going into the weekend many were expecting a domestic debut of at
                          least $150 million.

                          “Expectations aside, this is outstanding,” says David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm
                          Franchise Entertainment Research. “The movie is set up for a very strong run through the holidays.”
                          As the sequel to the highest-grossing movie in history, Hollywood has some pretty high expectations
                          for “The Way of Water,” which is Cameron’s first film to clear $100 million in a single weekend.
                          The first “Avatar” opened in 2009 with $77 million domestically: a decent start but hardly one for
                          the record books. But the film enjoyed unparalleled staying power, holding the No. 1 spot for seven
                          weeks in a row and continuing to draw audiences for months. Thanks to pricey 3D tickets and repeat
                          viewings, ticket sales eventually climbed to $760 million in North America and $2.92 billion
                          globally. “The Way of Water” will struggle to reach that benchmark, given the restrictions facing
                          the COVID-battered box office. It won’t be playing in Russia, where the original film grossed $116
                          million. Though it is screening in China, the country’s box office has been struggling to rebound.
                          Inaugural ticket sales in the country were below expectations at $57.1 million. In pandemic times,
                          only three movies have crossed $1 billion worldwide and none have managed to hit $2 billion (though
                          “Spider-Man: No Way Home” came close with $1.9 billion).

                          (Photo by Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP) “ Avatar: The Way of Water ” didn’t make quite as big of a
                          splash as many assumed it would, but James Cameron’s big budget spectacle still helped breathe life
                          into the box office this weekend. The sequel earned $134 million from North American theaters and
                          $300.5 million internationally for a $434.5 million global debut, according to studio estimates on
                          Sunday. It tied with “The Batman” as the fourth highest domestic debut of the year, behind “Doctor
                          Strange in the Multiverse of Madness” ( $187.4 million in May ), “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,”
                          ( $181 million in November ) and “Thor: Love and Thunder” ($144.2 million in July). Expectations
                          were enormous for “Avatar 2,” which carried a reported price tag of over $350 million, the pressure
                          of following up the highest grossing film of all time (thanks in part to various re-releases) over
                          a decade later and the daunting task of propping up an exhibition business that’s still far from
                          normal. Everything “Avatar” is oversized, though: the Na’vi characters, the runtime (a staggering
                          three hours and 12 minutes), the technical advancements and the release strategy from 20th Century
                          Studios and The Walt Disney Co. Going into the weekend many were expecting a domestic debut of at
                          least $150 million.

                          Square Enix has confirmed that the Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters, which are essentially upgraded
                          versions of Final Fantasy 1-6, will be released on Nintendo Switch and PS4 on April 19, 2023. The
                          Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters are currently available on PC and mobile, and soon a new audience
                          will be able to experience much of the history of the Final Fantasy franchise in a new way. If that
                          wasn't exciting enough, these versions come with a new pixel font, which seems to address one of
                          the biggest issues fans had with the games when they first were released - the questionable choice
                          of font by Square Enix for these remasters that left many unhappy. There will also be a new option
                          to switch between the original and new background music whenever you so choose, and there are more
                          options to adjust encounter rate, EXP, Gil, and ABP. All six games will be available on April 19 at
                          8am PT/11am ET/4pm BST, and fans will be able to purchase them individually or as a complete
                          package. On the eShop, the games range from $11.99-$17.99 per game, and all six can be purchased
                          for $74.99. For more, check out seven things you probably didn't know about Final Fantasy 1-3 and

                          2022 YG show it taking an odd path around our planet, stretching into an elongated ellipse in one
                          direction, then migrating back to a more circular orbit and stretching out again in the other
                          direction before the whole cycle repeats itself. Watching the asteroid's projected path over a
                          period of a few centuries is oddly hypnotic in this visualization posted to YouTube. Previous "mini

                          be with us deep into the next century. There have been mini-moon false alarms in the recent past.
                          An apparent new tiny satellite spotted in 2020 turned out to be a big hunk of space junk from a
                          1960s rocket launch instead.

                          TEMPE, Arizona – One of the final regular season tournaments on the college hockey schedule took
                          place over the weekend, with Arizona State hosting the Desert Hockey Classic at its newly opened
                          Mullett Arena. The field featured two NCAA tournament hopefuls, Boston University and Michigan
                          Tech, both of which had strong showings in the opening round. They dispatched Air Force and Arizona
                          State, respectively, to advance to the tournament final. Michigan Tech ended up winning 3-2 despite
                          being outshot by a decent margin, as one might expect between teams with such a disparity in the
                          number of drafted prospects on each roster. In the consolation game between the Falcons and Sun
                          Devils, the hosts picked up a 2-0 win to send their fans home happy. Here are some of the players
                          who stood out the most for each team: Register your Premium-membership at eliteprospects.

                          redirected off a Tech player, bounced off of Blake's pad, and across the line. BU added the extra
                          attacker with 1:48 left. The Terriers controlled play and had a number of backdoor chances that
                          didn't end up going on net. Parker Saretsky and Arvid Caderoth won some key faceoffs late, Brett
                          Thorne blocked a shot, and Blake Pietila made a big save to seal the victory. Shots favored BU
                          33-23. The Huskies were 3-for-3 on the penalty kill and 0-for-1 on the power play. It was the
                          second time Tech won the Desert Hockey Classic after winning the inaugural event in 2016 at Gila
                          River Arena. The Huskies finished their non-conference schedule with a 7-2 record after sweeps of
                          Alaska and St. Lawrence and single wins over No. 11 Michigan State, Arizona State, and No. 6 Boston
                          University. Tech improved to 7-0 all-time against BU in neutral site games. The last time the two
                          teams met prior to Saturday was November 1988. Arizona State defeated Air Force 2-0 in the
                          consolation game that took place after Tech's win.

                          in our comprehensive guide. Microsoft 365 has benefitted multiple people worldwide. Tools like
                          Microsoft Word are go-to solutions for many businesses, and students also gain significant value.
                          But despite Microsoft 365’s many benefits, some have perceived it not always to be the most
                          affordable tool. Now, however, that is changing. The company is kicking off 2023 with a $2 per
                          month Basic plan, and here’s everything you need to know. Whether you’re considering purchasing
                          Microsoft 365 for the first plan or you want to downgrade an existing subscription, knowing what
                          you get with Basic is a good idea. In the subsections below, we’ll cover the most important areas
                          of consideration. If you frequently use Microsoft 365’s products, you’ll want to ensure that you
                          have enough space in the cloud. And with Microsoft 365 Basic, you get precisely that. After
                          purchasing a Microsoft 365 Basic subscription, you can store up to 100 GB in your OneDrive cloud.
                          This should be more than enough for your Word documents, PowerPoint presentations, and so on. The
                          100 GB of storage is on par with Google One, which costs the same amount per month. Of course, you
                          probably want a premium Microsoft subscription to access all of the most important tools. And when
                          you sign up for Microsoft 365 Basic, you will get precisely that.

                          Asatryan Published on January 18th, 2023, 8:00 am EST Picture: Netflix Zack Snyder is teaming up
                          with Netflix to produce and direct two major sci-fi movies: Rebel Moon Part 1 and Part 2. The new
                          movie(s) is described as an epic sci-fi adventure compared with Star Wars in scope and scale.
                          Here’s an updated look at what we can expect from Rebel Moon which is now confirmed to arrive on
                          Netflix in December 2023. Zack Snyder will direct and co-write the film and will reunite with many
                          of his colleagues from past projects. The script for Rebel Moon will be co-written by Shay Hatten,
                          who co-wrote Army of the Dead, and Kurt Johnstad, who worked on 300 with Snyder. The Stone Quarry
                          is the main production company behind the movie with Grand Electric also listed, which is Eric
                          Newman’s production company that has an overall deal with Netflix. Snyder commented on the
                          inspiration for Rebel Moon in his THR interview: “This is me growing up as an Akira Kurosawa fan, a
                          Star Wars fan. It’s my love of sci-fi and a giant adventure.” @Netflix Let's go! https://t.

Question 241              : What was the annual GDP growth rate of the U.S. economy in 2022?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prediction (only positive):

  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          Altogether, CBO now estimates that actual output was about 1.3 percent less in 2021—but potential
                          output was about 0.2 percent greater—than the agency expected last July. In terms of underlying
                          trends that contribute to growth of real potential GDP over the 2022–2031 period, revisions are
                          very modest, and the average annual growth rate over the period, slightly greater than 1.8 percent,
                          is practically unchanged. In nominal terms, however, the agency’s projections of output and income
                          are higher throughout the projection period because projected inflation over the next several years
                          is above the rates anticipated in July. Nominal GDP is 4.9 percent higher, and national income is
                          3.9 percent higher, in 2031 than CBO projected last summer. CBO currently projects the unemployment
                          rate to be slightly lower and the labor force participation rate to be slightly higher over the
                          2022–2031 period than in the agency’s July 2021 forecast. CBO’s current projection of the average
                          unemployment rate over the 2022–2026 period is slightly lower than it was in that earlier
                          forecast—now 3.8 percent, down from 4.0 percent. The current projection of the labor force
                          participation rate is also lower—now 62.1 percent instead of 62.4 percent.

                          After 2023, in CBO’s projections, tightening monetary policy and several other factors combine to
                          slow the growth of demand, slowing output growth and further reducing inflationary pressures. Under
                          the assumption that current laws governing federal taxes and spending generally remain unchanged,
                          CBO projects that real GDP will grow by 3.1 percent in 2022 (as measured from the fourth quarter of
                          2021 to the fourth quarter of 2022). That expansion is driven by strong growth in consumer spending
                          and real business investment and by a shrinking U.S. trade deficit (see Table 2-2). The growth of
                          real GDP declines steadily through 2024, led by slower growth in consumer spending and investment,
                          before remaining almost constant through 2026. In the agency’s projections, real GDP grows at an
                          average annual rate of 1.6 percent from the beginning of 2023 through 2026. Data source:

                          rate to be slightly lower and the labor force participation rate to be slightly higher over the
                          2022–2031 period than in the agency’s July 2021 forecast. CBO’s current projection of the average
                          unemployment rate over the 2022–2026 period is slightly lower than it was in that earlier
                          forecast—now 3.8 percent, down from 4.0 percent. The current projection of the labor force
                          participation rate is also lower—now 62.1 percent instead of 62.4 percent.

                          likely to face intense grilling from politicians from both parties who argue that the popular app,
                          which has 150 million U.S. users, cannot be trusted. Here’s a quick guide for what to know about
                          Chew, a 40-year-old Singaporean who interned at Facebook and studied at Harvard Business School
                          before becoming the public face of one of the most popular — and contentious — apps in the United
                          States. TikTok's CEO testifies before Congress. Follow our live updates. Chew was born and raised
                          in Singapore, the island nation in Southeast Asia that has become a prominent bridge for
                          international business between China and the West. “The thing about growing up on a small island …
                          is you get wanderlust at a very young age,” he said in an interview last year. After completing his
                          military service — mandatory for most male Singaporeans — he left to study economics at University
                          College London (UCL), a top British university, graduating in 2006 and working at investment bank
                          Goldman Sachs for two years. He then moved to the United States to get his master’s degree at
                          Harvard Business School. “I remember struggling with this decision,” he said in a speech to UCL
                          graduates in 2022, as he was unsure whether taking time to do the master’s degree “would enhance or
                          delay my career.

                          spread of ‘harmful content’. The CEO of TikTok, Shou Zi Chew, is squaring off with United States
                          legislators in his first public congressional hearing over the app’s alleged ties to the Chinese
                          government. The hearing on Thursday is being held as support in Washington has grown for banning
                          the Chinese-owned app over national security concerns. The administration of President Joe Biden
                          reportedly has called on TikTok’s Chinese owners to sell the app or lose the ability to operate in
                          the US. Legislators have alleged that US user data could easily be shared with the Chinese
                          government, the app could be a disinformation and propaganda platform for Beijing and TikTok does
                          not adequately protect children from harm. China has countered that the US is spreading
                          disinformation and suppressing users. About 150 million US residents are among TikTok’s one billion
                          monthly global users, according to the company. That is nearly half the country’s population. “The

                          “TikTok has repeatedly chosen the path for more control, more surveillance and more manipulation,”
                          she said at the opening of the hearing. “Your platform should be banned”.

                          ultimate revenge. It also included a look back at the show's last decade since its September 2013
                          debut and even featured Megan Boone's Liz Keen. "When all this began, I was such a different
                          person. It's quite a story," Red stated in the clip. "When you love someone, you have no control.

                          each former foe. But Congressman Hudson (Toby Leonard Moore) proved to be the harbinger of the Task

                          Raymond Reddington. Ahead of the intense series finale of The Blacklist, Red is on the run and the

                          The Blacklist is hanging its hat up for good. After 10 years on NBC, it's time to say goodbye to
                          James Spader's Red Reddington and the rest of his criminal enterprise. The series will now end with
                          its 10th and final season, set to premiere Feb. 26. "After 10 years, hundreds of Blacklist cases
                          and more than 200 episodes produced, we're honored to reach our conclusion," showrunner and
                          executive producer John Eisendrath shared in the Feb. 1 announcement. "It's been incredibly fun to
                          create the strange, devious and delightful Blacklisters to challenge Raymond Reddington and our FBI
                          Task Force each week. We would like to thank everyone at NBC and Sony, our extraordinary crew who
                          make the impossible happen every day, our endlessly inventive writers and producers, and our
                          remarkable cast who brought life to these characters. We appreciate our dedicated fanbase who came
                          along for this wonderful ride and are excited to share this final season with them." NBC paired the
                          news with a trailer for the upcoming season, which teased former Blacklisters returning for their
                          ultimate revenge. It also included a look back at the show's last decade since its September 2013
                          debut and even featured Megan Boone's Liz Keen. "When all this began, I was such a different
                          person. It's quite a story," Red stated in the clip. "When you love someone, you have no control.

                          Front page layout Site theme Benj Edwards - Feb 6, 2023 5:10 pm UTC Since December 14, a Twitch
                          channel called Nothing, Forever has been streaming a live, endless AI-generated Seinfeld episode
                          that features pixelated cartoon versions of characters from the TV show. On Monday, Twitch gave the
                          channel a 14-day ban after language model tools from OpenAI went haywire and generated transphobic
                          content that violated community guidelines. Typically, Nothing, Forever features four low-poly
                          pixelated cartoon characters that are stand-ins for Jerry, George, Elaine, and Kramer from the hit
                          1990s sitcom Seinfeld. They sit around a New York apartment and talk about life, and sometimes the
                          topics of conversation unexpectedly get deep, such as in this viewer-captured segment where they
                          discussed the afterlife. Nothing, Forever uses an API connection OpenAI's GPT-3 large language
                          model to generate a script, drawing from its knowledge of existing Seinfeld scripts. Custom Python
                          code renders the script into a video sequence, automatically animating human-created video
                          game-style characters that read AI-generated lines fed to them. One of its creators provided more
                          technical details on how it works in a Reddit comment from December. As a new media experiment, the
                          faux-Seinfeld stream often feels awkward and unfunny, but it's still interesting because viewers
                          never know what the characters will talk about next.

                          Unfortunately for the show, that unexpected nature can be a double-edged sword regarding AI trained
                          on data scraped from the Internet. According to Vice, late Sunday night, the AI-generated clone of
                          Jerry Seinfeld (called "Larry Feinberg" in the AI show) went on a brief transphobic rant. Here's a
                          transcript: There’s like 50 people here and no one is laughing. Anyone have any suggestions? I’m
                          thinking about doing a bit about how being transgender is actually a mental illness. Or how all
                          liberals are secretly gay and want to impose their will on everyone. Or something about how
                          transgender people are ruining the fabric of society. But no one is laughing, so I’m going to stop.
                          Thanks for coming out tonight. See you next time. Where’d everybody go? In a Discord post from the
                          channel's creators, the malfunction occurred because of an outage from OpenAI's higher-cost (and
                          better-behaved) text-davinci-003 model led the creators to fall back to the lower-cost (and less
                          complex) text-curie-001 model to keep the show running. "The switch to Curie was what resulted in
                          the inappropriate text being generated," wrote an admin on the show's Discord channel. "We leverage
                          OpenAI’s content moderation tools, which have worked thus far for the Davinci model, but were not
                          successful with Curie.

                          A new figure entered the playbook last week — $7,598. That’s the voucher amount projected per

                          this potentially affect sports? I asked two notable Iowa high school activity directors to share

                          It’s also impossible to know yet whether certain counties are seeing a disproportionate share of
                          applications since the LSA analysis also noted only 57 of Iowa’s 99 counties had a certified
                          private school. That had been a concern of even some Republican lawmakers who worried the voucher
                          system would disproportionately hurt rural areas. Governor Kim Reynolds made the school choice law
                          a focal point of last November’s election and this year’s legislative session, signing the bill
                          into the law within the first weeks of the session. “I believe that school choice will improve our
                          overall education experience in Iowa,” Reynolds told TV9 in a statement on the application data. “I
                          believe it will create a system of schools, both public and private, that are driven by
                          student-centered missions. Iowans are hungry for Educational Freedom and the application numbers
                          are a reflection of that.” While Gov. Reyolds touted the program as empowering parental choice in
                          education, critics argued it took state funding away from public schools with public oversight and
                          handed it over to private schools with less public accountability on how those funds are used. The
                          ESA provides nearly $7,600 in state funding to each student who enrolls in a private school to pay
                          for tuition to attend that school, as well as other approved educational expenses like tutoring.
                          The funds cannot be used for school supplies, textbooks or college tuition and any unspent funding
                          would be returned to the state once the student graduates high school or turns 20 years old.

                          text-to-image tool – is getting more popular every day, with the community creating awesome (and
                          often really weird) pictures on Discord. But what is Midjourney from the creator's standpoint? The
                          tool's founder David Holz answered this question in a recent interview with The Verge, talking
                          about Midjourney's art style, copyright issues, and what AI is. Midjourney creators see their tool
                          "as an engine for the imagination," "a very positive and humanistic thing." Holz answered the most
                          popular question asked by artists when they deal with such technology: won't AI replace human art
                          one day? "What does it mean when computers are better at visual imagination than 99 percent of
                          humans? That doesn’t mean we will stop imagining. Cars are faster than humans, but that doesn’t
                          mean we stopped walking. When we’re moving huge amounts of stuff over huge distances, we need
                          engines, whether that’s airplanes or boats or cars." Moreover, Midjourney is a social product with
                          its huge Discord server created because "people really like imagining together." This social
                          aspect, however, could potentially cause problems for the AI due to copyright, and while you can’t
                          copyright AI-generated art, some artists might not be happy about technology taking their unique
                          style to train on.

                          It might be different for other [AI image] generators because they try to make something look like
                          the exact thing. But we have more of a default style, so it really does look like an art student
                          being inspired by something else. And the reason we do that is because you always have defaults, so
                          if you say “dog,” we could give you a photo of a dog, but that’s boring. From a human standpoint,
                          why would you want that? Just go to Google image search. So we try to make things look artistic.
                          That’s something you’ve mentioned a few times in our conversation — the default art style of
                          Midjourney — and I’m really fascinated by this idea that each AI image generator is its own
                          microcosm of culture, with its own preferences and expressions. How would you describe Midjourney’s
                          particular style, and how have you consciously developed it? [Laughing] It’s a little ad hoc! We
                          try lots of things, and every time we try a new thing, we render out a thousand images. And there’s
                          not really an intention to it. It should look generally beautiful. It should respond to specific
                          things and vague things. We definitely want it to not look like photos. We might make a realistic
                          version at one point, but we wouldn’t want it to be the default. Perfect photos make me a little
                          uncomfortable right now, though I could see legitimate reasons why you might want something more
                          realistic.

                          in Redmond, Wash. REDMOND, Wash. — Microsoft unveiled a new version of its Bing search engine on
                          Tuesday that incorporates cutting-edge artificial intelligence technology, which company executives
                          hope will help it eventually dethrone Google as the No. 1 search service. Microsoft is teaming up
                          with OpenAI, the San Francisco research lab behind ChatGPT, to revamp Bing so that it can handle
                          more complicated queries alongside providing factual information. "It's a new day for search," said
                          Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella in an announcement made at the company's headquarters on Tuesday. "In
                          fact, a race starts today in terms of what you can expect." Microsoft's announcement that it is
                          doubling down on what is considered the hottest new technology is a direct challenge to Google, the
                          dominant player in online search for decades. Google controls about 90% of the online search
                          market. Microsoft executive Yusuf Mehdi provided a demonstration of the retooled Bing at a briefing
                          with reporters. The new version is being teased for the public in a "limited preview," with a true
                          public launch coming soon, executives said.

                          Pikmin 4 is so close to lanching on the Nintendo Switch, and here's when fans can expect to jump
                          into the digital version. Pikmin 4 is set to launch for the Nintendo Switch on July 21 and marks
                          the newest numbered entry in the real-time strategy series in over ten years, making its release
                          quite the big deal for hardcore fans. Instead of playing as Captain Olimar (who most people know
                          from Super Smash Bros. at this point) or any of his space explorer comrades, gamers will get to
                          customize their own character (a series first). There are not too many options available, but it's
                          still a step forward in terms of a character creator in a Nintendo first-party title. Pikmin 4
                          comes out in a couple of days and retails for $59.99, the same price as most other major games on
                          the Switch. People who decided to pre-order the game digitally via the Switch eShop are probably
                          wondering just when they'll be able to actually boot the game and start playing --that's where this
                          guide comes into play. RELATED: Pikmin 4 Fans Are Paying for Ads of the Game to Appear Over Time
                          Square Before we get into it, it's worth pointing out that this is the expected release time for
                          Pikmin 4 --it has not been officially confirmed by Nintendo just yet.

                          This fourth entry has been a long time coming, with Shigeru Miyamoto saying back in 2015 that it
                          was “very close to completion.” Seven years later, it’s finally set to release in July. This
                          installment introduces a new Ice Pikmin that can freeze enemies and the environment to help your
                          alien flora navigate the strange planet they find themselves on. The plants aren’t alone this time
                          around, either, as they get help from a rotund dog called Oatchi, who can smash through barriers
                          and carry Pikmin on its back while swimming across ponds and puddles. Overall, it looks like good
                          fun for fans of the series or anyone interested in picking up a colorful, cartoonish strategy game.

                          necessarily know the denominator. At the end of the year, Meta had roughly 86,000 employees. Most

                          So if we're going by that and we add it together - you know, 21,000 people being let go - that
                          could be nearly a quarter of Meta's workforce.PFEIFFER: That's a lot. And how big a deal do you
                          think that is in terms of the impact it has on the company?SCHECHNER: Well, I mean, you can see it
                          from - people inside the company are anxious. You know, Mark Zuckerberg sends a message to staff,
                          and it's 2,200 words long. And, you know, there's some mea culpas in there. But there's also this
                          vision that he's trying to get across of a leaner, more nimble company. And he's actually, at
                          points in this memo, talking about how he thinks it will - and is making things operate more
                          efficiently, more effectively than before.PFEIFFER: During the pandemic, Meta and many other tech
                          companies were just hiring madly. So are these layoffs essentially returning Meta to its
                          pre-pandemic level, or do you see it going deeper than that? Any idea?SCHECHNER: Well, we'll have
                          to see where it ends up landing. But, you know, Mark Zuckerberg, in this memo, what struck me is
                          that he said that this is something that he sees continuing for many years. It's a new economic
                          reality.

                          Super Bowl LVII was an American football game played to determine the champion of the National
                          Football League (NFL) for the 2022 season. The American Football Conference (AFC) champion Kansas
                          City Chiefs defeated the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Philadelphia Eagles, 38–35.
                          The game was played on February 12, 2023, at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. It was the
                          fourth Super Bowl hosted by the Phoenix metropolitan area, and the third at this venue, with the
                          most recent previously being Super Bowl XLIX in 2015 (then known as University of Phoenix
                          Stadium).[6] Both teams finished the regular season with a league-best 14–3 record. This was the
                          Eagles fourth Super Bowl appearance overall and the second in the last six seasons, having
                          previously won Super Bowl LII; the Eagles previously lost Super Bowls XV and XXXIX. This was the
                          Chiefs' fifth Super Bowl appearance overall and third in the last four seasons, having previously
                          won Super Bowls IV and LIV, and losses in Super Bowls I and LV. After the Eagles went into halftime
                          up 24–14, the Chiefs mounted a comeback to win the game 38–35 with a game-winning field goal kicked
                          by Harrison Butker. Butker's game winning kick was set up by a pivotal and controversial defensive
                          holding call on Philadelphia cornerback James Bradberry, which was criticized by some observers but
                          supported by others.

                          The AFC Championship pitted the Chiefs against the Cincinnati Bengals in a rematch of the 2021 AFC
                          Championship game. This was the fifth consecutive AFC Championship hosted by the Chiefs, extending
                          their record. Much like the previous year's contest, the game was close toward the end of the
                          fourth quarter. On the game's last drive, tied at 20, Bengals defensive end Joseph Ossai was
                          flagged for a late hit on Patrick Mahomes after he stepped out of bounds, which set the Chiefs up
                          in field goal range with eight seconds remaining. Harrison Butker then kicked a 45-yard field goal
                          to send the Chiefs to the Super Bowl with a 23–20 win.[46] The Eagles went into the playoffs as the
                          No. 1 seed in the NFC. Their first playoff matchup was against their NFC East rival New York
                          Giants. The Eagles quickly jumped to a 28–0 halftime lead and cruised to the NFC Championship game
                          with a 38–7 victory, which marked the first playoff win for Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts and head
                          coach Nick Sirianni. In the NFC Championship, the Eagles hosted the San Francisco 49ers. The Eagles
                          won the NFC Championship, 31–7, as the 49ers lost their starting and backup quarterbacks to
                          injury.[47] As the designated home team in the Super Bowl's annual rotation between the two
                          conferences, the Eagles chose to wear their green home jerseys with white pants.

                          South Korea-based entertainment giant SM Entertainment generated revenues of 238.1 billion South
                          Korea Won (USD $179.4m) in Q3 2022 (the three months to end of September). That’s according to
                          investor filings published by the firm on Monday (November 14). That $179.4 million revenue haul
                          represents growth of 65.4% YoY. SM’s roster includes K-Pop stars like SUPER JUNIOR, Girls’

                          season as host. The panel of coaches for the season consists of Blake Shelton, who returned for his
                          twenty-third and final season as a coach; returning coach Kelly Clarkson, who returned for her
                          ninth season after a one-season hiatus; and debuting coaches Chance the Rapper and Niall Horan.[3]
                          Gina Miles was named as the winner of the season, with the closest margin to-date, on the season
                          finale that aired on May 23, 2023. Her victory marks Niall Horan's first win as a coach, with Horan

                          that, beginning with the 2021–22 United States network television schedule, only one season would
                          be produced per cyclical year,[6] though it was reported that this decision was reversed upon the

                          By Nilay Patel, editor-in-chief of the Verge, host of the Decoder podcast, and co-host of The
                          Vergecast. For the final episode in our Centennial Series covering companies that are 100 years
                          old, I’m talking to Chris Cocks, the CEO of Hasbro. And I have to tell you, I did not know the
                          company was started in 1923 by the Hassenfeld brothers… the Has bros. This is my favorite fact now.
                          Hasbro is now a big company, and it makes everything from Transformers and Lincoln Logs to My
                          Little Pony and Monopoly. It also makes Magic: The Gathering and Dungeons & Dragons, which are
                          massive and growing businesses. Chris was actually the head of that division, called Wizards of the
                          Coast, before he became the CEO of Hasbro overall last year. Since then, he’s started the process
                          of restructuring the company, which is pure Decoder bait. He’s also dealt with some crises: he’s
                          fended off an activist investor that wanted him to spin off Wizards of the Coast into a new
                          company. The Magic community was upset that too many card sets were being released, including rare
                          collector cards that could suddenly be bought by anybody with enough money. Then, an attempt to
                          change the open gaming license for Dungeons & Dragons led to fan backlash, and Hasbro walked the
                          entire plan back.

                          22] That same year, Milton Bradley merged with Parker Bros. to form Hasbro Games. In 1999, Hasbro
                          paid $325 million for rights to Pokémon toys.[23] The same year, Wizards of the Coast was bought in
                          a deal worth $325 million.[24] Wizards of the Coast is now a subsidiary of Hasbro and has Avalon
                          Hill as its division. In 2001 money-losing Hasbro Interactive was sold to Infogrames, a French
                          software concern, for $100 million.[25] Hasbro entered the building block toy with its Built to
                          Rule line in 2003, which did not hold together well or were too hard for the targeted age group,
                          thus ended in 2005.[26] In 2008, Hasbro acquired game maker Cranium, Inc. for $77.5 million. The

                          By Nilay Patel, editor-in-chief of the Verge, host of the Decoder podcast, and co-host of The
                          Vergecast. For the final episode in our Centennial Series covering companies that are 100 years
                          old, I’m talking to Chris Cocks, the CEO of Hasbro. And I have to tell you, I did not know the
                          company was started in 1923 by the Hassenfeld brothers… the Has bros. This is my favorite fact now.
                          Hasbro is now a big company, and it makes everything from Transformers and Lincoln Logs to My
                          Little Pony and Monopoly. It also makes Magic: The Gathering and Dungeons & Dragons, which are
                          massive and growing businesses. Chris was actually the head of that division, called Wizards of the
                          Coast, before he became the CEO of Hasbro overall last year. Since then, he’s started the process
                          of restructuring the company, which is pure Decoder bait. He’s also dealt with some crises: he’s
                          fended off an activist investor that wanted him to spin off Wizards of the Coast into a new
                          company. The Magic community was upset that too many card sets were being released, including rare
                          collector cards that could suddenly be bought by anybody with enough money. Then, an attempt to
                          change the open gaming license for Dungeons & Dragons led to fan backlash, and Hasbro walked the
                          entire plan back.

                          Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Elon Musk on Wednesday announced the formation of a
                          new company focused on artificial intelligence, after months of teasing plans to build a rival to
                          ChatGPT. The company, called xAI, unveiled a website and a team of a dozen staffers. The new
                          company will be led by Musk, according to the website, and “will work closely with X (Twitter),
                          Tesla, and other companies to make progress towards our mission.” “The goal of xAI is to understand
                          the true nature of the universe,” the website states, echoing language Musk has used before to
                          describe his AI ambitions. Musk was an early backer of ChatGPT-creator OpenAI, but later criticized
                          the company for inputting safeguards that aim to prevent the viral chatbot from spewing biased or
                          sexist responses. “The danger of training AI to be woke – in other words, lie – is deadly,” Musk
                          tweeted in December, responding to a Twitter user who asked OpenAI’s CEO if it was possible to
                          “turn off the woke settings” on ChatGPT. In an interview with then-Fox News host Tucker Carlson in
                          April, Musk said teased plans for his new AI venture. “We’re going to start something which I call
                          TruthGPT,” he said, describing it as a “maximum truth-seeking AI” that “cares about understanding
                          the universe.”

                          was dissolved as a company this week and was replaced by a new company Musk calls X. The move is
                          seen as an attempt to build a social media platform that also allows payments, turning it into “the
                          everything app,” akin to how apps like WeChat work in China. Twitter announced this week it was
                          partnering with eToro to allow users to be able to trade stocks and crypto. It should be pretty
                          clear by now that Musk’s call for a six-month pause was purely out of self interest in the AI arms
                          race, as I wrote at the time. ChatGPT has become a fascinating tool for people who want to
                          experiment with large language models (LLMs) that answer questions posed in natural language. But
                          there are still a lot of kinks to be worked out, as ChatGPT will often give confident answers, even
                          when it’s wrong. AI is largely a magic trick at this point, sometimes spouting nonsense that users
                          may not know enough about to fact-check. But it’s an interesting magic trick and it’s something
                          that will improved upon as more people in the world of tech become involved. Musk must know he’s

                          Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Elon Musk on Wednesday announced the formation of a
                          new company focused on artificial intelligence, after months of teasing plans to build a rival to
                          ChatGPT. The company, called xAI, unveiled a website and a team of a dozen staffers. The new
                          company will be led by Musk, according to the website, and “will work closely with X (Twitter),
                          Tesla, and other companies to make progress towards our mission.” “The goal of xAI is to understand
                          the true nature of the universe,” the website states, echoing language Musk has used before to
                          describe his AI ambitions. Musk was an early backer of ChatGPT-creator OpenAI, but later criticized
                          the company for inputting safeguards that aim to prevent the viral chatbot from spewing biased or
                          sexist responses. “The danger of training AI to be woke – in other words, lie – is deadly,” Musk
                          tweeted in December, responding to a Twitter user who asked OpenAI’s CEO if it was possible to
                          “turn off the woke settings” on ChatGPT. In an interview with then-Fox News host Tucker Carlson in
                          April, Musk said teased plans for his new AI venture. “We’re going to start something which I call
                          TruthGPT,” he said, describing it as a “maximum truth-seeking AI” that “cares about understanding
                          the universe.”

                          9 yards per carry for the Maroon squad, running through some decent holes produced by most of the
                          first-team offensive line. “To me, that’s the one area that we had to improve in,” Pry said. “We
                          have to be able to run the football. It really helps everything else. With our offense, with our
                          defense. If we can run the ball, that to me is 100-level foundational stuff. And we’re getting
                          better there. “I think we’ve got a pretty good group up front on defense. We’ve got some old heads
                          at d-tackle that have got some weight on them, can press gaps and do things, and we were still able
                          to get some movement on them guys. So it’s a work in progress, but again, I think the O-line’s
                          improved, I think the running backs are better. I like what’s happening in that room. Still got a
                          ways to go.” Nice write up on the game and the team. Enjoyed it. thanks Mid-May should be
                          interesting to see who hits the portal. kinda smh as to why qb’s didn’t get a chance to run with
                          1’s/maroon at least for a series… kinda disservice to drones for sure Soooo….I didn’t get to watch
                          the game. Did Grant Wells really have 3 kickoffs? 😲 Those duplicate numbers mess up the stat guys

                          There was never going to be a definitive answer exiting the Spring Game, but we all got the chance
                          to see the development of Grant Wells and the capabilities of Kyron Drones at the quarterback
                          position. Wells finished 12-of-18 for 148 passing yards (66.7%) and a TD. He had 3 rushes for 10
                          yards and a rushing touchdown. Notably, Wells threw 6 passes that were gains of 16-or-more yards.
                          The incumbent starter mostly linked up with the Gosnell brothers (Stephen and Benji) and Tucker
                          Holloway. Wells executed his plays and limited the risky elements of his playstyle. It also helps
                          that he inherited the more stable offensive line, which once again benefited his performance.

                          And in Delhi are eager customers like Amar Bhasin, 41, whose first cellphone, bought 18 years ago,
                          was a Panasonic. More recently, he bought an iPad from an Indian outlet, only to discover that its
                          screen was cracked. The store refused to exchange it, and local service centers weren’t helpful. So
                          Mr. Bhasin addressed a letter to Mr. Cook himself — and a month later, a new iPad appeared in the
                          mail. “I felt so good, and became an Apple fan instantly — who does that?” Mr. Bhasin said,
                          standing before the still-shrouded Apple Saket. “I don’t see myself buying another brand in the
                          foreseeable future.” India is an important frontier for Apple. It was by far the biggest country to
                          lack an outlet bearing its own brand. Some much smaller countries have multiple Apple stores:
                          Switzerland has four, and even Macau, a Chinese territory with a population of 680,000, or 0.5
                          percent of India’s, has two. But those countries are something India is not: rich. Even the lower-
                          to middle-income countries with Apple stores, such as Brazil, Thailand and Turkey, have per-capita
                          incomes several times higher than India’s. In a potential market so big, Apple does not need to
                          make much of a dent to earn back its investment. The company’s market share in India has been
                          growing rapidly.

Question 275              : What was Sundar Pichai's total compensation in 2022?

                          Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google and its parent firm Alphabet, was awarded a total compensation
                          valued at $226 million in 2022, according to a regulatory filing released by the firm last Friday.
                          This mammoth compensation includes stock awards valued at more than $200 million. google The median
                          total compensation for Google parent Alphabet's employees was $279,802 in 2022, according to the
                          filing, implying that CEO Pichai’s compensation was 808 times that amount. Someone making the
                          $15.50 minimum wage in Alphabet’s home state of California would have to work 14.6 million hours,
                          or just over 7000 years (with 40 hour work weeks and no time off) to catch up with Pichai’s 2022
                          salary. CEO Pichai had said in January that top executives, including him would get lower bonuses
                          as part of cost-cutting measures, following the largest round of layoffs in the company’s history.
                          Last month, Google’s finance chief told employees to expect more spending cuts. Amid the mass
                          layoffs, global recession fears and economic uncertainty, this mammoth compensation was a big boost
                          for CEO Pichai, who made just over $6 million in 2021 and $7.4 million in 2020. The rest of the
                          compensation besides the stock awards reportedly came from a $2 million base salary and more than
                          $5 million for a private security detail in 2022.

                          U.S, Soccer has announced the hiring of Matt Crocker as the federation’s new sporting director. The
                          48-year-old will replace Earnie Stewart, who left U.S. Soccer in January to take a role with Dutch
                          power PSV. Crocker joins from Southampton, where he is currently serving as the club’s director of
                          football operations. Prior to that, he spent seven years as the head of England’s youth
                          international teams for both men and women. “I’m really honored and excited to join U.S. Soccer as
                          sporting director,” Crocker told reporters on Tuesday. “The immediate focus is supporting where I
                          can the women’s World Cup team as they get ready for Australia and New Zealand… Leading the search
                          for the next men’s coach is an opportunity I’m excited about.” Per U.S. Soccer, Crocker will not
                          start on a full-time basis until August 2 (which is to say, one day after the U.S. women’s national
                          team finishes its group stage slate at the World Cup), but “will immediately begin the process of
                          hiring the head coach of the Men’s National Team and supporting the U.S. Women’s National Team
                          general manager Kate Markgraf and USWNT head coach Vlatko Andonovski.” Crocker’s first, and
                          arguably biggest task in his new job will be hiring a permanent U.S. men’s national team head coach
                          ahead of a home World Cup in 2026.

                          U.S, Soccer has announced the hiring of Matt Crocker as the federation’s new sporting director. The
                          48-year-old will replace Earnie Stewart, who left U.S. Soccer in January to take a role with Dutch
                          power PSV. Crocker joins from Southampton, where he is currently serving as the club’s director of
                          football operations. Prior to that, he spent seven years as the head of England’s youth
                          international teams for both men and women. “I’m really honored and excited to join U.S. Soccer as
                          sporting director,” Crocker told reporters on Tuesday. “The immediate focus is supporting where I
                          can the women’s World Cup team as they get ready for Australia and New Zealand… Leading the search
                          for the next men’s coach is an opportunity I’m excited about.” Per U.S. Soccer, Crocker will not
                          start on a full-time basis until August 2 (which is to say, one day after the U.S. women’s national
                          team finishes its group stage slate at the World Cup), but “will immediately begin the process of
                          hiring the head coach of the Men’s National Team and supporting the U.S. Women’s National Team
                          general manager Kate Markgraf and USWNT head coach Vlatko Andonovski.” Crocker’s first, and
                          arguably biggest task in his new job will be hiring a permanent U.S. men’s national team head coach
                          ahead of a home World Cup in 2026.

                          is finally here, with the company unveiling the Google Pixel Fold at Google I/O 2023, alongside the
                          Pixel 7a and Pixel Tablet. This looks to essentially be a foldable take on the Pixel 7 Pro, and
                          that’s no bad thing, as Google’s 2022 flagship remains one of the best phones you can buy. But the
                          Pixel Fold is a far more ambitious device, with much of that core Pixel 7 Pro tech being joined by
                          a 7.6-inch foldable display, and wrapped up in a design that makes this the thinnest foldable phone
                          on the market. Below you’ll find full details of the Google Pixel Fold, including its specs, its
                          release date, and its predictably high price. The Google Pixel Fold is available to order now if

                          starts at $1,799 / £1,749 (around AU$2,655), which is in line with the price of the Samsung Galaxy

                          Google will launch its first foldable smartphone sometime in June, challenging Samsung's
                          market-leading foldable phone business, according to internal communications viewed by CNBC. It
                          plans to announce the device at its annual developer conference, Google I/O, on May 10. The Pixel
                          Fold, known internally by the codename "Felix," will have the "most durable hinge on a foldable"
                          phone, according to the documents. It will cost upward of $1,700 and compete with Samsung's $1,799
                          Galaxy Z Fold 4. Google plans to market the Pixel Fold as water-resistant and pocket-sized, with an
                          outside screen that measures 5.8 inches across, according to the documents.

Question 288              : What is the name of Google's foldable smartphone?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                          Google (GOOG, GOOGL) debuted its Pixel Fold smartphone at its annual I/O developers conference in
                          Mountain View, CA. on Wednesday. The phone, which—hold your breath—will cost $1,799, is Google’s
                          first foldable handset, and its first ultra premium device. The company also revealed its low-cost
                          Pixel 7A at the show. Like Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 4, the Pixel Fold opens up like a book, allowing
                          users to take advantage of its front display, or its larger tablet-like inner screen. Google says
                          the Pixel Fold’s 5.8-inch external display should feel just like a standard smartphone screen
                          whether surfing the web or checking TikTok. That would be a sharp contrast from Samsung’s Z Fold,
                          which uses a larger, though thinner 6.2-inch outer screen that can feel cramped while doing things
                          like typing messages. Inside, the Pixel Fold gets a 7.6-inch panel that folds directly down its
                          center line. The Z Fold packs a similar internal display, though it looks as though Samsung’s
                          offering has thinner bezels around its inner screen. Google also claims that the Pixel Fold is the
                          thinnest foldable on the market whether folded or unfolded. That should come as a relief to
                          consumers who’ve balked at Samsung’s bulky Z Fold’s design.

                          Apart from its folding design, Google’s pricey new phone also mostly sticks to familiar territory —
                          we haven’t seen much so far that sets it apart from other Pixels and other foldables. Google may
                          well develop more standout tricks for the Fold down the road — we know the company is working on an
                          “interpreter mode” for Google Translate that uses both screens for in-person translations — but it
                          feels like a lot of the same in a new package for now. What it is: a new, midrange smartphone How
                          much does it cost? $499 What does it promise? Google’s most thoughtful software features, on a
                          budget. With the Pixel 7a, Google mostly stuck to its usual playbook: it took last year’s Pixel 7,
                          kept most of its important guts, made its shell out of cheaper materials, and planned to sell it
                          for less. This time, Google made one surprising change to the formula: it stuck a higher-resolution
                          main camera sensor in the back, so expect slightly more detailed photos. Apart from that, though,
                          this is Google’s attempt at making some of its hallmark Pixel features, like Magic Eraser for
                          photos, smart call screening, and a tool for quickly navigating customer service phone trees
                          available to a wider audience. That may all sound a bit basic, and perhaps it is. But after living
                          with the device for about a week, I never really felt like I was missing out on anything more
                          expensive devices offered.

                          California state laws add six months to the federal PHE requirements on health plans to continue
                          covering COVID-19 tests, vaccines and treatment from any licensed provider (in- or out-of-network)
                          with no prior authorization or enrollee cost sharing. The federal PHE ends on May 11, 2023, and
                          state laws extend these requirements for six months through November 11, 2023. After November 11,
                          2023, enrollees can continue to access COVID-19 tests, vaccines and treatment with no prior
                          authorization or cost sharing when they access these services through their health plan’s network.
                          Health plan enrollees can be charged cost-sharing only if these services are provided out of
                          network after November 11, 2023. View the DMHC COVID-19 fact sheet for more information and

                          Medi-Cal, even if their income or other circumstances changed. This became known as the “continuous
                          coverage requirement.” This assured that low-income families, older adults, working adults,
                          children, and people with disabilities would have access to health care throughout the pandemic.

                          However, HHS continues to review the flexibilities and policies implemented during the COVID-19 PHE
                          to determine whether others can and should remain in place, even for a temporary duration, to
                          facilitate jurisdictions’ ability to provide care and resources to Americans. Still, others will
                          expire. Below is a list of some of the changes people will see in the months ahead. Certain
                          Medicare and Medicaid waivers and broad flexibilities for health care providers are no longer
                          necessary and will end. During the COVID-19 PHE, CMS has used a combination of emergency authority
                          waivers, regulations, and sub-regulatory guidance to ensure and expand access to care and to give
                          health care providers the flexibilities needed to help keep people safe. States, hospitals, nursing
                          homes, and others are currently operating under hundreds of these waivers that affect care delivery
                          and payment and that are integrated into patient care and provider systems. Many of these waivers
                          and flexibilities were necessary to expand facility capacity for the health care system and to
                          allow the health care system to weather the heightened strain created by COVID-19; given the
                          current state of COVID-19, this excess capacity is no longer necessary. CMS developed a roadmap for
                          the eventual end of the COVID-19 PHE, which was published in August 2022, and has been sharing
                          information on what health care facilities and providers can do to prepare for future emergencies.
                          This includes facilities returning to normal operations and meeting CMS requirements that promote
                          the safety and quality of care they provide.

                          already related to computers directly as they do with humans, the added human-like face emerged as
                          an annoying interloper distracting the user from the primary conversation.[11] First introduced in
                          Microsoft Office 97,[12] the Office Assistant was codenamed TFC during development.[13] It appeared
                          when the program determined the user could be assisted by using Office wizards, searching help, or
                          advising users on using Office features more effectively. It also presented tips and keyboard
                          shortcuts. For example, typing an address followed by "Dear" would cause the Assistant to appear
                          with the message, "It looks like you're writing a letter. Would you like help?" Microsoft turned
                          off the feature by default in Office XP.[14] The feature was removed altogether in Office 2007 and
                          Office 2008 for Mac.

                          dream, to create, to innovate. Each of us seeks to do work that gives us purpose — to write a great
                          novel, to make a discovery, to build strong communities, to care for the sick. The urge to connect
                          to the core of our work lives in all of us. But today, we spend too much time consumed by the
                          drudgery of work on tasks that zap our time, creativity and energy. To reconnect to the soul of our
                          work, we don’t just need a better way of doing the same things. We need a whole new way to work.
                          Today, we are bringing the power of next-generation AI to work. Introducing Microsoft 365 Copilot —
                          your copilot for work. It combines the power of large language models (LLMs) with your data in the
                          Microsoft Graph and the Microsoft 365 apps to turn your words into the most powerful productivity
                          tool on the planet. “Today marks the next major step in the evolution of how we interact with

                          growth,” said Satya Nadella, Chairman and CEO, Microsoft. “With our new copilot for work, we’re
                          giving people more agency and making technology more accessible through the most universal
                          interface — natural language.

Question 292              : What is the name of Google's AI image editing tool?

                          Magic Editor
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prediction (only positive):
  - Answer              :  Magic Editor,
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          By Emma Roth, a news writer who covers the streaming wars, consumer tech, crypto, social media, and
                          much more. Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO. One of the most impressive demos at
                          Google I/O started with a photo of a woman in front of a waterfall. A presenter onstage tapped on
                          the woman, picked her up, and moved her to the other side of the image, with the app automatically
                          filling in the space where she once stood. They then tapped on the overcast sky, and it instantly
                          bloomed into a brighter cloudless blue. In just a matter of seconds, the image had been
                          transformed. The AI-powered tool, dubbed the Magic Editor, certainly lived up to its name during
                          the demo. It’s the kind of tool that Google has been building toward for years. It already has a
                          couple of AI-powered image editing features in its arsenal, including the Magic Eraser, which lets
                          you quickly remove people or objects from the background of an image. But this type of tool takes
                          things up a notch by letting you alter the contents — and potentially, the meaning — of a photo in
                          much more significant ways. While it’s clear that this tool isn’t flawless — and there remains no
                          firm release date for it — Google’s end goal is clear: to make perfecting photos as easy as just
                          tapping or dragging something on your screen.

  - Source              :
                          The draft is conducted under the eligibility rules established in the league's 2017 collective
                          bargaining agreement (CBA) with its players' union, with special modifications agreed to by both
                          parties due to disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The previous CBA that ended the 2011
                          lockout instituted no immediate changes to the draft, but it called for a committee of owners and
                          players to discuss further charges. Players who were not automatically eligible had to declare
                          their eligibility for the draft by notifying the NBA offices in writing no later than at least 60
                          days before the event. For the 2023 draft, the date fell on April 23. Under the CBA a player may
                          withdraw his name from consideration from the draft at any time before the final declaration
                          deadline, which usually falls 10 days before the draft at 5:00 pm EDT (2100 UTC). Under current
                          NCAA rules, players usually have until 10 days after the draft combine to withdraw from the draft
                          and retain college eligibility. They must have withdrawn on or before May 31, 22 days prior to this
                          draft.[70] A player who has hired an agent retains his remaining college eligibility regardless of
                          whether he is drafted after an evaluation from the NBA Undergraduate Advisory Committee. Players
                          who declare for the NBA draft and are not selected have the opportunity to return to their school
                          for at least another year only after terminating all agreements with their agents, who must have
                          been certified.[73]

                          Games can be played with Bluetooth game controllers that connect to the headset. Apple Vision Pro
                          is priced starting at $3,499 and it is set to launch in early 2024. It will be available on
                          Apple.com when it launches, and in stores only in the United States to begin with. Note: See an
                          error in this roundup or want to offer feedback? Send us an email here. Apple Vision Pro is a
                          "mixed reality" headset, meaning it can display both virtual and augmented reality content. It is
                          not like augmented reality glasses, however, as it is designed to completely cover the eyes and
                          block out all of your surroundings. Apple is using exterior and interior cameras for the augmented
                          reality component of the device. The cameras are able to map the space around you and project the
                          real world back to you, so though you're not actually looking at what's around you using
                          see-through glasses, you are effectively seeing an accurate picture of your real world environment.
                          With this capability, Apple can show you 3D windows, objects, and content in your actual space, or
                          the cameras can be turned off to shut out the world to provide an entirely virtual setting. Apple
                          is focusing on the headset's ability to allow for working, content consumption, gaming,
                          communication and other activities to be done "anywhere" with just the Vision Pro.

                          Games can be played with Bluetooth game controllers that connect to the headset. Apple Vision Pro
                          is priced starting at $3,499 and it is set to launch in early 2024. It will be available on
                          Apple.com when it launches, and in stores only in the United States to begin with. Note: See an

                          "mixed reality" headset, meaning it can display both virtual and augmented reality content. It is
                          not like augmented reality glasses, however, as it is designed to completely cover the eyes and
                          block out all of your surroundings. Apple is using exterior and interior cameras for the augmented
                          reality component of the device. The cameras are able to map the space around you and project the
                          real world back to you, so though you're not actually looking at what's around you using
                          see-through glasses, you are effectively seeing an accurate picture of your real world environment.
                          With this capability, Apple can show you 3D windows, objects, and content in your actual space, or
                          the cameras can be turned off to shut out the world to provide an entirely virtual setting. Apple
                          is focusing on the headset's ability to allow for working, content consumption, gaming,
                          communication and other activities to be done "anywhere" with just the Vision Pro.

                          CUPERTINO, California, June 5 (Reuters) - Apple (AAPL.O) on Monday unveiled a costly
                          augmented-reality headset called the Vision Pro in its riskiest bet since the introduction of the
                          iPhone more than a decade ago, barging into a market dominated by Meta (META.O). At its annual
                          developer conference, Apple also introduced a raft of new products and features, including a
                          15-inch MacBook Air, a powerful chip called M2 Ultra, improvements to its iOS software and a
                          long-awaited tweak to prevent its autocorrect from annoyingly changing a common expletive to
                          "ducking". The Vision Pro will start at $3,499, more than three times the cost of the priciest
                          headset in Meta's line of mixed and virtual reality devices. The headset will test a market crowded
                          with devices that have yet to gain traction with consumers and put it in direct competition with
                          Facebook-owner Meta after years of clashes between the companies over issues like user privacy and

                          features as well as the sports and entertainment partnerships it would offer. The device will use a
                          new chip called R1 that will process information from its sensors in less time than the blink of an
                          eye, Apple said. But the announcements failed to excite Wall Street, which had bid up Apple shares
                          to a record high ahead of the launch. The stock was largely flat in post-market trading.

                          delivery. While some exceptions do apply, Amazon's standard return policy also applies to items
                          purchased during Prime Day. This bestselling one-piece has been called "the unicorn of swimsuits"
                          for its flattering fit. Like previous years, 2023 Prime Day took place over a two-day span,
                          Tuesday, July 11 and Wednesday, July 12. Amazon Prime Day dates for 2024 have not yet been
                          announced. According to Amazon, the event originally started as a summer savings event to celebrate
                          Amazon's birthday, which launched in July 2015. Due to the pandemic, the retailer pushed Prime Day
                          2020 to October and then moved back to the summer months with Prime Day 2021 and Prime Day 2022
                          falling in June and July. However, in October 2022, the retailer introduced a second two-day sale
                          event that year: "Prime Early Access Sale." This gave Amazon Prime members another chance to score
                          savings ahead of the Black Friday and Cyber Monday shopping weekend. A monthly Prime membership
                          costs $14.99 a month, but you can also purchase an annual membership for $139, which ultimately
                          saves you a few dollars a month. Additionally, college students can get a Prime membership for only
                          $7.49 per month or $69 per year — and students who are new to Prime Student can sign up for a
                          six-month trial.

                          Beginning Monday, July 3, 2023, through Monday, July 10, 2023, Prime members can get a $5
                          promotional credit with the purchase of an Amazon eGift Card worth $50 or more. This is a nice
                          opportunity to save a little extra if you already plan to spend at least $50 on Prime
                          Day—especially since that $50 gift card can also be applied to your purchase. After an order is

                          redeemable through Friday, August 25), and their savings will reflect at checkout. There is a
                          caveat, though: This credit can be applied only to items shipped and sold by Amazon, not products
                          sold by third-party sellers or gift cards. Only current Prime members qualify for this offer. But
                          that shouldn’t be a problem, considering you also have to be a Prime member to score many of
                          Amazon’s Prime Day deals. Plus, non-members can always take advantage of this offer and of Amazon’s
                          Prime Day discounts by signing up for a 30-day free trial.

                          According to Amazon's policy, most items shipped from Amazon.com can be returned within 30 days of
                          delivery. While some exceptions do apply, Amazon's standard return policy also applies to items
                          purchased during Prime Day. This bestselling one-piece has been called "the unicorn of swimsuits"
                          for its flattering fit. Like previous years, 2023 Prime Day took place over a two-day span,
                          Tuesday, July 11 and Wednesday, July 12. Amazon Prime Day dates for 2024 have not yet been
                          announced. According to Amazon, the event originally started as a summer savings event to celebrate
                          Amazon's birthday, which launched in July 2015. Due to the pandemic, the retailer pushed Prime Day
                          2020 to October and then moved back to the summer months with Prime Day 2021 and Prime Day 2022
                          falling in June and July. However, in October 2022, the retailer introduced a second two-day sale
                          event that year: "Prime Early Access Sale." This gave Amazon Prime members another chance to score
                          savings ahead of the Black Friday and Cyber Monday shopping weekend. A monthly Prime membership
                          costs $14.99 a month, but you can also purchase an annual membership for $139, which ultimately
                          saves you a few dollars a month. Additionally, college students can get a Prime membership for only
                          $7.49 per month or $69 per year — and students who are new to Prime Student can sign up for a
                          six-month trial.
