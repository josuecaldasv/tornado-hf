Question 2              : The genre of the drama "Good Sam" is what?

  - Source              :
                          Sam Griffith (Sophia Bush) is a female lead, still a rarity in medical dramas. The cast diversity
                          is notable: Malcolm Kinglsey (Edwin Hodge) is a Black man from a wealthy, prominent family. Wealthy
                          Black Americans aren't usually showcased on television. Malcolm is also a love interest for Sam,
                          adding to the representation of interracial relationships on television. However, most of the
                          diversity comes in the form of the secondary cast (Skye P. Marshall, Omar Maskati, Davi Santos),
                          who are very involved in the main storylines. Did we miss something on diversity? Suggest an
                          update. A scene with a major character being shot. Scenes of heart surgery. A scene with a patient
                          who was punched by his wife for cheating. Did you know you can flag iffy content? Adjust limits for
                          Violence & Scariness in your kid's entertainment guide. Swear words like "ass," "damnit," "ass
                          kisser." Did you know you can flag iffy content? Adjust limits for Language in your kid's
                          entertainment guide. Parents need to know that Good Sam is a medical procedural featuring a
                          father-and-daughter heart surgeon team who hash out their familial drama as they save patients.
                          Parents should be aware of scenes featuring simulated heart surgery and other scary topics, such as
                          conversations about a near-fatal car accident, "coding" (needing to be resuscitated), and other
                          medical lingo.

                          NCAAF 45 Brent Key was pulled out of an offensive game plan meeting on Oct. 4 and told to walk up
                          the hill to Georgia Tech’s administrative offices. When Key, the offensive line coach, got there,
                          he learned head coach Geoff Collins had been fired. Key, a Georgia Tech graduate who started at
                          guard all four years on The Flats, would be the head coach for the remainder of the season.
                          Advertisement As he walked back down the hill toward the football offices, Key, 42, immediately
                          identified his first priority as the head coach of his alma mater. Before Key could even think
                          about Georgia Tech beating an FBS opponent — something that hadn’t happened since a game at Duke
                          nearly a year earlier — he had to fix one glaring issue. So he headed straight for the office of
                          linebackers coach Jason Semore. Semore, known to his friends as Boogie, instantly knew what Key
                          wanted to discuss. Something had to be done about Georgia Tech’s punt protection. The Yellow
                          Jackets had four punts blocked in their first four games. A block two days earlier at UCF had been
                          returned for a touchdown and erased a Georgia Tech lead just before halftime. Clemson had blocked
                          two punts in the season opener. Ole Miss had blocked one near the start of a 42-0 blowout. Of all
                          the things Georgia Tech had done wrong over the course of a 1-3 start, punt protection was the most
                          consistently bad.

                          Cybertruck and the Tesla Semi and will serve as the site of Tesla’s corporate headquarters. It is
                          the second biggest factory by size in the United States and the second largest building in the
                          world by volume. Source: Tesla, Wikipedia At the beginning of 2022, Tesla employeed a total of
                          99,920 workers. Just a year ago, the company had 70,757 full-time employees, which constituted
                          47.36% growth since 2019. Between 2019 and 2021, Tesla added 22,741 new employees. Since 2020, the
                          company has employed 40% more people. Earlier years saw a decline in the number of employees at
                          Tesla’s facilities. Between 2018 and 2019, the number of people working for Tesla was reduced,
                          causing its worldwide staff to shrink from 48,817 in 2018 to 48,016 in 2019. The year 2018 was more
                          successful: it saw an increase of 30.03% from 2017.

                          Analysts predict that Tesla’s rapid growth can accelerate in the third quarter and beyond. Speaking
                          at the annual shareholder meeting, Elon Musk mentioned the company’s future production plans,
                          saying that by the end of 2022, Tesla might reach an annual production run rate of 2 million
                          vehicles: “We’re aiming to achieve a 2 million vehicle run-rate by the end of the year… Thanks to
                          the hard work of the Tesla team, we’ve already been able to achieve a 1.5 million unit annualized
                          run rate. And depending on how the rest of this year goes, I think we might get close to, or will
                          get approximately at the 1.5 million mark, and will be exiting the year at a 2 million-unit
                          run-rate,” Musk said. In the fourth quarter of 2022, Tesla delivered nearly 405,300 units. Its
                          quarterly deliveries grew by 17.87% during this quarter, compared to the same quarter of 2021.
                          Between November and December 2022, Tesla’s deliveries crossed the 405,000 unit mark, setting a new
                          record. The deliveries in the third quarter of 2022 totaled 343,000. Overall, in 2022, Tesla
                          delivered 1,313,851 and produced 1,369,611 units. Since 2018, Tesla has delivered 3,382,821 and has
                          produced 3,429,532 cars.

Question 7              : Where is the Super Bowl held in 2022?
Correct Answers         :  
                          SoFi Stadium
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - Source              :
                          Super Bowl LVI[12] was an American football game played to determine the champion of the National
                          Football League (NFL) for the 2021 season. The National Football Conference (NFC) champion Los
                          Angeles Rams defeated the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Cincinnati Bengals, 23–20.
                          The game was played on February 13, 2022, at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, the home
                          stadium of the Rams, marking the second consecutive and second overall Super Bowl with a team
                          playing and winning in its home stadium.[13][14][15][16] The Rams' victory was their second, first
                          as a Los Angeles-based team, and first since winning 1999's Super Bowl XXXIV when they were based
                          in St. Louis. Finishing with a 12–5 record, the Rams reached their fifth appearance after acquiring
                          veteran quarterback Matthew Stafford, who had not won a playoff game in his previous 12 years with
                          the Detroit Lions. The Bengals, who finished with a 10–7 record, were seeking their first Super
                          Bowl title following several decades of losing seasons and playoff struggles. They won their first
                          playoff game since 1990, ending the longest drought in the four major North American sports, en
                          route to their third Super Bowl appearance and first since 1988's Super Bowl XXIII.

                          Because New Orleans was supposed to host it, but a conflict with Mardi Gras forced them to push
                          hosting back to 2025. The NFL officially announced that Las Vegas would host the 2024 Super Bowl.
                          Allegiant Stadium, the new home of the Raiders, will host Super Bowl 58, which is no surprise given
                          that the NFL prioritizes hosting the Super Bowl at stadiums with recently updated and upgraded
                          amenities. Location also plays a role in this, as the NFL has historically preferred warm-weather
                          locations for stadiums without a dome. SoFi Stadium has a roof, but the sides of the structure are
                          open. As such, it is considered an open-air stadium. Below are the sites the NFL has pinned as
                          future Super Bowl locations. The Super Bowl halftime show will feature five rap and R&B legends in
                          2022. Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Mary J. Blige and Kendrick Lamar will be the performers for the
                          spectacle. The quintet has a combined total of 43 Grammys and 21 Billboard No. 1 albums. For more

                          Guyton. She recently became the first Black artist to earn a Grammy nomination for Best Country
                          Album of the Year. Eric Church and Jazmine Sullivan performed the anthem in 2021.

                          49][50] For instance while Los Angeles has been a eight-time host city with its most recent being
                          Super Bowl LVI in 2022, it did not host one from the departure of both its NFL teams in 1995 until
                          the Rams and the Chargers subsequently came back to Los Angeles in 2016 and 2017 respectively. The
                          Louisiana Superdome has hosted seven Super Bowls, the most of any venue, with an eighth Super Bowl
                          scheduled to take place in the 2024–25 season. The Orange Bowl was the only AFL stadium to host a
                          Super Bowl and the only stadium to host consecutive Super Bowls, hosting Super Bowls II and III.
                          Seven Super Bowls have been held in a stadium other than the one the NFL team in that city was
                          using at the time, a situation that has not arisen after Super Bowl XXVII's host stadium was
                          selected on March 19, 1991. This was as the winning market was previously not required to host the
                          Super Bowl in the same stadium that its NFL team used, if the stadium in which the Super Bowl was
                          held was perceived to be a better stadium for a large high-profile event than the existing NFL home
                          stadium in the same city; for example, Los Angeles's last five Super Bowls were all played at the
                          Rose Bowl, which has never been used by any NFL franchise outside of the Super Bowl.

                          Truth Social (stylized as TRUTH Social) is an alt-tech[2][3][4] social media platform created by
                          Trump Media & Technology Group, an American media and technology company founded in October 2021 by
                          former US president Donald Trump.[5][6][2][7][4] It has been called a Twitter clone that competes
                          with Parler, Gab and Mastodon in trying to provide an alternative to Twitter and
                          Facebook.[2][4][7][1] The service was launched on February 21, 2022.[8] Since mid-2022, Truth
                          Social has been facing financial and regulatory issues. The application was initially not available
                          on Google Play because of violations of Google policies prohibiting content with physical threats
                          and incitement to violence, but was approved for Google Play in October 2022 after agreeing to
                          enforce policies against incitement.[9] As of March 6, 2023[update], it was ranked number 101 in
                          Apple's App Store rankings for social media apps,[10] and SimilarWeb ranked its website as number
                          203 in their "News & Media Publishers" category, behind Gab at number 154, but ahead of Parler at
                          number 1,052.[11][12] Trump estimated in an April 2023 personal financial disclosure that the
                          site's value ranged from $5 million to $25 million.[13] Former U.S.

                          Reports say that Trump has been privately complaining that Google was trying to "fuck" him.
                          According to Rolling Stones' source, however, the truth is that Truth Social hasn't even submitted
                          an Android app to the Google Play store yet. Still, though, the launch of a web app is significant.
                          Truth Social profiles and posts will now be completely shareable on other platforms. Using the
                          iPhone app, if you want to share a Truth Social post on another platform, you have to take a
                          screenshot. Now, Truth Social users will be able to post links directly to any account or post. In
                          turn, non-Truth Social users will have direct access to sign up and engage with content on the
                          site. (Note: Internal Truth Social links currently require users to login to their account in order
                          to see the content.) In short: It's going to be a lot easier for Trump's fanbase to share his
                          content on other platforms. Launched in February, Truth Social struggled during the first few
                          months. Downloads plummeted after the initial rush to download due to a long waitlist of users
                          wanting to sign up. However, in recent weeks, Trump finally started posting on his own platform,
                          which has helped give the conservative social network another bounce. Truth Social announced a
                          public beta of the web app just last week. According to a press release from Wednesday, the initial
                          web app rollout was scheduled for some time over the next week or two.

                          Press Association announced the winners for the 79th Annual Golden Globe Awards tonight with The
                          Power of the Dog named Best Motion Picture – Drama and West Side Story as Best Motion Picture –
                          Musical or Comedy. On the television side, Succession won Best Television Series – Drama, while
                          Hacks won for Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy. After a year of controversy about
                          diversity, payola, and improper behavior endemic to the organization that culminated in the Globes
                          losing its NBC broadcast, tonight’s coverage and the subsequent congratulatory marketing from
                          winners will be a good litmus test for if the beleaguered organization can rinse off some of the
                          stink from a year of bad headlines and even more puzzling decisions. If you need a refresher on the
                          ins and outs of what happened read our recap of how we got here. Over the last eight months, the
                          HFPA has reformed its bylaws, implementing changes that address ethics and code of conduct,
                          diversity, equity and inclusion, governance, and membership. The HFPA recently admitted their
                          largest and most diverse class to date of 21 new members, all of whom are first-time Golden Globe
                          voters.

                          On the TV side, ABC comedy Abbott Elementary — which boasted the most nominations of any show with
                          five — built off of its Emmy momentum and went to the head of the class, winning best comedy honors
                          and Golden Globes for Quinta Brunson and Tyler James Williams. An even bigger Emmy magnet, HBO's
                          The White Lotus, enjoyed the privilege of converting its four nominations into two awards, one for
                          best limited series and another for Jennifer Coolidge (who also delivered the funniest speech of
                          the night). And then Game of Thrones prequel House of the Dragon added some surprise to the night
                          by claiming the best drama award. Elsewhere, Tár's Cate Blanchett, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever's
                          Angela Bassett, and Elvis' Austin Butler scored trophies, along with The Bear's Jeremy Allen White,
                          Euphoria's Zendaya, and Yellowstone's Kevin Costner. In addition, Murphys were honored: Five-time
                          Globe winner Ryan Murphy was given the Carol Burnett Award and Eddie Murphy was handed the Cecil B.

                          Concerns about the lack of diversity in the HFPA board and the award nominees were brought up last
                          year, and similar concerns were still brought up this year. Similar to NBC’s stance, many actors
                          were absent in a statement to demand change. Winning actors including Will Smith, Nicole Kidman,
                          Andrew Garfield and Rachel Zegler were not present to receive their awards. While the HFPA has
                          announced new policies for diversity, equity and inclusion, and inducted 21 new members, including
                          several people of color as well as the addition of Neil Phillips as chief diversity officer, the
                          future of the Golden Globes still remains uncertain. Despite the controversy, though, many films
                          and television shows have much to celebrate as their casts and crews were recognized for their hard
                          work. Best Motion Picture — Musical or Comedy: “West Side Story” After receiving 4 nominations,
                          Steven Spielberg’s 2021 adaptation of the 1957 musical dominated the Comedy/Musical category at the
                          79th Golden Globe Awards. “West Side Story,” won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture —
                          Musical/Comedy and Best Supporting Actress Role — Motion Picture (Ariana DeBose). The film scored
                          two additional wins via Rachel Zegler, who made her film debut as the female lead, Maria Vasquez,
                          and Arianna Debose, who played Anita.

                          Filed under: There’s a steady drip of news as the tech giant tries to clear its huge deal — here’s
                          what’s new Microsoft is attempting to persuade regulators around the world to clear its $68.7
                          billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard — the biggest deal of its kind the gaming industry has
                          ever seen. Amid concerns about its effect on competition in the industry — particularly in the
                          nascent cloud gaming market — and in the face of ardent lobbying against the deal by competitor
                          Sony, the U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority first decided to block the acquisition, then
                          agreed to further talks with Microsoft and Activision. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has
                          withdrawn its attempt block the deal legally after a federal judge ruled in favor of Microsoft
                          being allowed to close the deal. The European Union, meanwhile, has given the deal its seal of
                          approval. Here’s the latest on Microsoft’s plans to snap up Activision Blizzard. According to
                          Reuters and Bloomberg, the Federal Trade Commission has withdrawn its administrative case against
                          Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard, which was due to go before an in-house judge in
                          August. Microsoft and Activision had requested the case be withdrawn after the FTC lost its case
                          arguing for a block on the deal in district court, and was denied an extension of a temporary block
                          by an appeals court. The move means Microsoft and Activision can now try to persuade the U.S.
                          antitrust regulator to accept a settlement.

                          what’s new Microsoft is attempting to persuade regulators around the world to clear its $68.7
                          billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard — the biggest deal of its kind the gaming industry has
                          ever seen. Amid concerns about its effect on competition in the industry — particularly in the
                          nascent cloud gaming market — and in the face of ardent lobbying against the deal by competitor
                          Sony, the U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority first decided to block the acquisition, then
                          agreed to further talks with Microsoft and Activision. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has
                          withdrawn its attempt block the deal legally after a federal judge ruled in favor of Microsoft
                          being allowed to close the deal. The European Union, meanwhile, has given the deal its seal of
                          approval. Here’s the latest on Microsoft’s plans to snap up Activision Blizzard. According to
                          Reuters and Bloomberg, the Federal Trade Commission has withdrawn its administrative case against
                          Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard, which was due to go before an in-house judge in
                          August. Microsoft and Activision had requested the case be withdrawn after the FTC lost its case
                          arguing for a block on the deal in district court, and was denied an extension of a temporary block
                          by an appeals court. The move means Microsoft and Activision can now try to persuade the U.S.
                          antitrust regulator to accept a settlement.

                          Super Bowl ad has always attracted attention for the outsized cost: the average cost of a 30-second
                          ad on national TV during primetime averages $115,000 – a number the Super Bowl surpassed in the
                          1970s, according to Nielsen Media Research. The automobile and food and beverage industries make up
                          the bulk of spending. A FOX Business analysis in 2020 marked out Honda, FedEx, Miller, Dodge,
                          Toyota, Ford, McDonald’s, Coca-Cola, Pepsi and Budweiser as the companies that have spent the most
                          over the years, with Budweiser spending $449.5 million on 135 ads across 53 Super Bowls. The Super
                          Bowl crossed the landmark $1 million mark in 1995, climbing to $2 million in the new millennium.
                          The price steadily rose over the following decade, reaching 2.95 million in 2010. SUPER BOWL 2022:

                          $300,000 over the next three years. The cost had still almost doubled in a decade.

                          after learning his feature on Black Wall Street had won an Emmy Award, Lockett was honored again on
                          Thursday night as the 2022 Seattle Male Sports Star of The Year. The live awards show has been a
                          tradition in Emerald City dating back to 1936. Created by the Seattle Post-Intelligencer and
                          renowned sports editor Royal Brougham, the show has honored some of the biggest names to play
                          professional sports in the city. Since arriving in Seattle from Kansas State in 2015, Lockett has
                          developed into a reliable and incredibly productive receiver in the Seahawks offense, and 2021 was
                          arguably his best season yet, setting a career high with 1,175 receiving yards, his
                          third-consecutive 1,000-yard season. The successes have continued off the field. Lockett received
                          the 2021 Steve Largent Award, given annually to the team contributor who best exemplifies the
                          spirit, dedication, and integrity of the Seahawks. He was also the Seahawks nominee for the NFL's
                          Walter Payton Man of the Year Award, recognizing a player for their excellence on and off the
                          field. And if that wasn't enough, Lockett passed his real estate licensing exam earlier this
                          offseason, selling his first home in April.

                          In 1961, three Black students began classes at Georgia Tech and made history, making the Institute
                          the first higher education entity to peacefully integrate in the Deep South without a court order.
                          Civil unrest was rampant throughout college campuses across the South. In recognition of their
                          roles as trailblazers, Tech’s first Black students — Lawrence Williams, Ralph Long Jr., and the
                          late Ford Greene, along with the first Black graduate Ronald Yancey — were awarded the 2022 Ivan
                          Allen Jr. Prize for Social Courage on April 20 at the Biltmore Ballroom in Atlanta. A symposium was
                          led by 2020 Ivan Allen Jr. Prize recipient Charlayne Hunter-Gault where Long Jr., Williams, and
                          Yancey discussed the integration of the Institute, the former students’ personal experiences, and
                          the continued struggle for racial equity and inclusion at higher education institutes across the
                          nation. During the panel session, the three former students recounted the racism they encountered —
                          despite a facade of peaceful integration. Although their experiences left them feeling socially and
                          intellectually isolated from most of the student body at the time, the pioneers expressed their
                          hope that future generations of Black students at Tech feel at home on campus. “I’m so thankful for
                          those who continue to matriculate here and carry on the tradition,” said Williams. A video greeting
                          from Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens, a Georgia Tech chemical engineering graduate himself, was
                          presented at the celebration.

                          Project Iris headset is the next big thing from Google with Augmented Reality (AR) to compete with;
                          Metaverse and upcoming tech from Microsoft and Apple. Previously, the tech giant was in the plan to
                          bring the DayDream VR headsets as well as Google Glasses. Now, the boom of Augmented Reality might
                          have changed the direction of the company to concentrate on the AR world making them join the
                          league after Facebook, Microsoft, and Apple. The codename of these new AR headsets is Project Iris
                          and Google may use a similar type of outer camera technology. The outward cameras on the headsets
                          will blend computer graphics with a feed of the real world. The headset from Google will work
                          wirelessly and doesn’t require any tethered connection as per the reports. Moreover, Project Iris
                          will feature the Silicon technology chipset from the last year’s announced Pixel 6 smartphone. This
                          Augmented Reality headset from Google looks like a pair of “ski goggles” with cameras on them which
                          doesn’t require external power. Furthermore, the specific chipset used on the headsets is the GS101
                          chipset; however, the graphic-intensive visuals are sourced from a different point. This means the
                          headset requires an active internet connection; that receives the data from the data centers that
                          remotely render graphics. Also Read: 9 Best PS5 Headsets For Amazing Gaming Experience As we have

                          Daniel Dominguez Meta has unveiled its AI Research SuperCluster (RSC) supercomputer, aimed at
                          accelerating AI research and helping the company build the metaverse. The RSC will help the company
                          build new and better AI models, working across hundreds of different languages, and to develop new
                          augmented reality tools. Developing the next generation of advanced AI will require powerful new
                          computers capable of quintillions of operations per second. Meta’s researchers have already started
                          using RSC to train large models in natural-language processing (NLP) and computer vision for
                          research, with the aim of one day training models with trillions of parameters across Meta’s
                          businesses, from content-moderation algorithms used to detect hate speech on Facebook and
                          Instagram, to augmented-reality features that will one day be available in the metaverse. RSC can
                          train models that use multimodal signals to determine whether an action, sound or image is harmful
                          or benign. Meta claims this will not only help keep people safe on Meta’s services today, but also
                          in the metaverse.

                          Atlanta, Miami, Los Angeles and Tampa Bay were the four candidates for the three contests; Atlanta
                          received Super Bowl LIII, Miami received Super Bowl LIV and Los Angeles (which declined to bid on
                          Super Bowl LIV and was not eligible for Super Bowl LIII) was granted Super Bowl LV.[20] On May 18,
                          2017, authorities announced that the opening of Los Angeles's new stadium, SoFi Stadium, originally
                          scheduled for the start of the 2019 season, had been delayed a year to 2020. As a result, at the
                          league's owners meetings in Chicago on May 23, 2017, the league re-awarded Super Bowl LV to the
                          lone remaining candidate, Tampa Bay, and awarded Super Bowl LVI to Los Angeles.[21] The official
                          logo for the game was unveiled on February 9, 2021, maintaining the standard design used since
                          Super Bowl LI, but introducing sunset-themed[22] designs reflecting the landscape of the host
                          city/nearby area (featuring in this case palm trees) within the traditional Roman numerals.[23] In
                          early January 2022, it was reported that AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, was being considered as
                          an alternate site for the game as a contingency plan due to an increase of COVID-19 infections in
                          California attributed to the Omicron variant. The stadium last hosted Super Bowl XLV in 2011.

                          an honor. Sharpless awarded his second Nobel Prize in Chemistry–one of only two chemists to ever
                          receive such an honor. October 05, 2022 LA JOLLA, CA—Scripps Research professor K. Barry Sharpless,
                          PhD, has been awarded the 2022 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his groundbreaking research in
                          developing “click chemistry,” an ingenious method for building molecules. Sharpless, the W.M. Keck
                          Professor of Chemistry, shares the prize with Carolyn R. Bertozzi, PhD, of Stanford University and
                          Morten Meldal, PhD, of the University of Copenhagen for the development of click chemistry and
                          bioorthogonal chemistry, according to the Nobel Prize committee. Sharpless previously shared the
                          2001 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on chirally catalyzed oxidation reactions, making him
                          the second scientist ever to win two Nobel Prizes in Chemistry. Frederick Sanger won the Nobel
                          Prize in Chemistry in 1958 and 1980. “Barry Sharpless has had a tremendous impact on chemistry,
                          first with his development of asymmetric synthesis and now with his elegant ‘click chemistry,’”
                          says Peter Schultz, PhD, President and CEO of Scripps Research. “His work opened whole new
                          scientific frontiers that have had a major impact on the fields of chemistry, biology and medicine.

                          Bioorthogonal reactions are used widely to investigate vital processes in cells, and those
                          applications have had an enormous impact on the fields of biology and biochemistry. Researchers can
                          probe how biomolecules interact within cells, and they can image living cells without disturbing
                          them. In studies of disease, bioorthogonal reactions are useful for studying not just the cells of
                          patients but also those of pathogens: The proteins in bacteria can be labeled to follow their
                          movements through the body. Researchers are also starting to develop engineered antibodies that can
                          click onto their tumor targets to deliver cancer-killing therapeutics more precisely. “These very
                          important accomplishments and these really fantastic discoveries from our three laureates have
                          really made an enormous impact on chemistry and on science in general,” Ramström said. “For that,

                          Bowl XLII? For the second straight year, we had a truly exciting game, in which the Cardinals

                          Super Bowl XLIV--New Orleans 31, Indianapolis 17--This was the first meeting of #1 seeds in the
                          Super Bowl since 1993, and both teams got off to blistering regular season starts--the Colts 14-0
                          before losing their last two, and the Saints 13-0 before losing their last three games. But both
                          dominated in the postseason until meeting in Miami. The Colts were favored, but they hadn't faced
                          an offense quite like New Orleans'. And though the Colts jumped out to a 10-0 lead, Drew Brees
                          methodically picked the Colts' defense apart, and Sean Payton gambled and won with an onside kick

                          review aggregator Metacritic.[27] PC Magazine praised Lost Ark's combat, writing, "Abilities look

                          when you divekick a crowd, and blast fodder monsters into bloody chunks.

                          Update 2/16/2022: Amazon Games and Smilegate have announced some updated numbers for Lost Ark's big
                          opening weekend, including a peak of over 1.2 million concurrent viewers on Twitch and over 59.9
                          million hours watched cumulatively during launch week. Additionally, in the first three days of its
                          launch, Lost Ark gained over 4.7 million new registered players in the West. Original story:
                          Following its official free-to-play launch on February 11, Lost Ark has already become Steam's
                          second most-played game of all time by concurrent players with an all-time peak of 1,325,305
                          people. As revealed by SteamDB, Lost Ark passed Counter-Strike: Global Offensive's all-time peak of
                          1,308,963 players to secure the #2 spot. Considering these all-time peaks tend to happen around a
                          game's release, it may be quite an uphill battle to take down PUBG's record of 3,257,248 players at
                          one time. That aside, it's an impressive feat for the MMO that is developed by Smilegate and Tripod
                          Studio and published by Amazon Game Studios. This accomplishment shouldn't come as too much of a
                          surprise as Lost Ark had already become one of Steam's biggest-ever games before it even went
                          free-to-play. As with many MMOs or online games, there were some server issues as millions of
                          players attempted to play Lost Ark at once.

                          In an effort to help relieve server stress, Smilegate offered players extra Founders Pack items to
                          encourage players to swap to quieter servers. In our Lost Ark review in progress, we said, "Lost
                          Ark takes a genuinely impressive stab at the isometric action RPG genre, and its integration into a
                          perpetually online world hasn’t seemed too invasive from what I’ve seen so far. It’s expansive and
                          deep, capable of scratching the itch for a new Diablo-like action RPG that is potentially filled
                          with other players to meet and team up with. The excellent and flexible combat system channels the
                          best of its ARPG forebears, but it can start to wear out after you’ve slaughtered your way through
                          enough lower-tier enemies." Lost Ark was first released in South Korea in 2019 and later in Japan
                          and Russia, and now North American and European players can jump into Lost Ark's action, which
                          includes 15 playable characters, a full campaign, and co-op PvE combat. Have a tip for us? Want to

                          Games, winning silver in the grueling 30km mass start cross-country race while fighting off both

  - Source              :
                          October 30, 2020 • 3 For the last decade, Marvel has led the adaptations of superhero comic books
                          into films. In 2019, the journey culminated in the release of Avengers: Endgame, which premiered to
                          critical and commercial success. It had gone from a story about a playboy billionaire (Tony
                          Stark/Iron Man) to a larger story than spanned universes as well as heroes and villains alike.
                          Although, as the universe expanded, it was hard to ignore that Marvel’s roster of superheroes still
                          lacked diversity. This was made even more apparent when other superhero stories started to make
                          their way into the mainstream. In the same year that Endgame came out, a quiet and subversive TV
                          show was making waves. The Boys is adapted from a graphic novel of the same name, one that is
                          notorious amongst fans and haters alike for its crude, graphic and violent nature. The series
                          considers what would happen if superheroes existed in the real world. The short answer is that they
                          would become an untouchable commodity that could wreak havoc, which would be cleaned up by their
                          slick and all-powerful parent company Vought. The series touches on power, social media, politics
                          and causes the line between hero and villain to become truly blurred. It is difficult not to draw
                          comparisons between the storylines in The Boys and the reality of the MCU (Marvel Cinematic
                          Universe).

                          Elden Ring has sold more 13.4 million copies to date and continues to gather new fans with every
                          day that passes. It’s been a near ever-present in the steam charts since its release in February
                          and you’d certainly be hard pushed to find a better Game of the Year contender outside
                          FromSoftware’s latest action RPG. But despite many fans diving back into the game over and over
                          again (there is 6 endings after all), most of the community are desperate to see what the developer
                          does with the game next, especially with regards to more post-launch content. At this point,
                          nothing has been officially announced with both FromSoftware and Publisher Bandai Namco avoiding
                          any concrete answers on the future of the game. That being said, FromSoftware does have a history
                          of releasing DLC for their previous titles. Dark Souls 1-3, Bloodborne and Sekiro: Shadows Die
                          Twice all received hefty post-launch support and content updates. There have also been hints in
                          press releases, with one including a quote from Bandai Namco Entertainment President and CEO Yasuo
                          Miyakawa which talks about “expanding the brand beyond the game itself”. Clearly Bandai Namco know
                          they need to capitalise on a game as significant as Elden Ring, and you would imagine one of the
                          easiest ways to do that would be via post launch content.

                          15th, Świątek won her first career WTA 1000-title at the Italian Open, defeating former champion
                          Karolína Plíšková in just 46 minutes without the loss of a single game. She advanced to the final
                          after defeating two-time champion and world No. 5, Elina Svitolina, and the second best-ranked
                          teenager Coco Gauff on the same day, as well as saving match points in her third-round match
                          against Barbora Krejčíková.[43] Świątek became the third player to win a title after saving match
                          point en route in 2021, alongside Naomi Osaka at the Australian Open and Ashleigh Barty in Miami.
                          She also became the fourth teenager to win a WTA 1000 event.[44][45] This successful run to her

                          Iga Swiatek has done it again. For the second time this year, she’s standing at the top of a
                          podium, holding a Grand Slam trophy above her head. This time, she defeated Ons Jabeur 6-2, 7-6(5)
                          to win the 2022 US Open, capping off a year of incredible and unexpected success. Swiatek, who
                          looked extremely nervous before the match began, looked anything but once the rackets started
                          swinging. She came out strong, showing off all the skills we know her for: explosive movement,
                          pinpoint precision and a soft touch. By comparison, Jabeur, who looked comfortable and happy before
                          the match started, came out looking flat and tentative. It wasn't until Swiatek was up 3-0 that
                          Jabeur got on the board. Then, in the fifth game of the first set, Jabeur hit four winners, each
                          one perfectly placed along the singles sideline. All Swiatek could do with those is watch them
                          bounce as Jabeur narrowed the gap at 3-2. Unfortunately, that was the last game Jabeur won in the
                          first set. Swiatek was able to reach balls that most people couldn't even try for, while Jabeur
                          couldn't stop hitting the ball into the net at the most vital moments. Swiatek claimed the first
                          set in 30 minutes flat, and made it look as effortless as ever.

                          The second set was entirely different from the first. While Jabeur again didn't win a game until
                          Swiatek was up 3-0, she finally found her gear. Her excellent slice finally began to appear and she
                          began going to the net more, helping her win four of the next five games. Swiatek appeared to have
                          finally wrestled the momentum of the match back to her side, breaking a 5-5 tie to get within one
                          game of the title, but she couldn't close and Jabeur tied it up once again. The tiebreak was close,
                          and it looked like Jabeur could run away with it at any moment, but an unforced error from Jabeur
                          ended the tiebreak and gave Swiatek her first US Open championship and her third career Grand Slam
                          trophy. When it was all over, Swiatek and Jabeur shared a heartfelt embrace, and then Swiatek
                          immediately burst into happy tears. She'd earned it. This victory puts an exclamation point on the
                          best year of Swiatek's young career — or the best year of anyone’s career, really. She started 2022
                          by falling just short of the finals at the Australian Open (she was knocked out in the semis by
                          Danielle Collins), but she rebounded to produce one of the most dominant stretches of tennis we’ve
                          seen in decades. Swiatek beat Annet Kontaveit to win the Qatar Open.

                          The 32 medals won by Russian athletes mark the most medals ever won by Russian athletes in on
                          Winter Olympics, regardless of representation. Host-nation China delivered its best Winter Olympics
                          performance, scoring the third-most gold medals (9) but ranking 11th with 15 total medals. The
                          nation's previous best total was 11 total medals, reached in both 2006 and 2010. For the United
                          States, Nathan Chen, Jessie Diggins, Lindsey Jacobellis, Elana Meyers Taylor, and Madison Hubbell
                          and Zach Donohue all secured multiple medals. Jacobellis is the only athlete to win two gold
                          medals. After PyeongChang saw a Winter Olympics-record 30 different National Olympic Committees win
                          medals, 29 different NOCs claimed at least one medal in Beijing. We've come a long way since the
                          inaugural Winter Olympics in 1924, when 16 events across six sports were decided in Chamonix,
                          France. *It should be noted that ROC's gold medal in the team figure skating event is provisional
                          and dependent upon the adjudication of Kamila Valieva's doping case. The U.S. finished second with

                          2020. Still, in 2022, Stapleton's steady traditionalism and consistency as a live act won the day.
                          Together with his All-American Road Show, the singer has been one of country music's most prolific
                          and reliable touring acts this year, and he is even the subject of a current Country Music Hall of
                          Fame exhibit. Early in the year, he won three Grammy Awards, including Best Country Album for his

Question 34              : What chip does the iPhone 14 have?

                          This means that these devices will retain the A15 processor that is currently inside the iPhone 13

                          A16 chip inside. By differentiating the chip between the four iPhone 14 models, Apple is
                          essentially giving customers an additional reason to opt for the higher-end (and more expensive)
                          iPhone 14 Pro models. While we’re still waiting on real-world testing, the roadmap from Apple’s
                          supper TSMC indicates that the A16 chip will be manufactured with the same 5-nanometer process as
                          the A15, which is also the same as the A14. Sticking to the same fabrication size limits the
                          year-over-year performance improvements, but it doesn’t mean we won’t see any improvements. From
                          the A14 to the A15 chips, Apple delivered ~10% performance and efficiency improvements. It’s
                          unclear whether we’ll see similar bumps this year, but we wouldn’t expect completely flat
                          year-over-year performance gains. One sketchy iPhone 14 Pro rumor suggested that the first testing
                          with the A16 chip indicated performance would only be a “few percent” better than the A15. Apple
                          then, however, worked to improve the chip’s thermal management, leading to a bigger jump in

Question 35              : When is Google I/O 2022 scheduled to take place?

  - Source              :
                          That's in line with when Google normally holds its developers conference — last year's edition took
                          place on May 11 and May 12, for example. There will be an in-person event at the Shoreline
                          Amphitheatre in Mountain View, Calif., a venue that's just down the street from Google
                          headquarters. Most people will attend virtually, though since Google streams its developer
                          conference. The Google I/O 2023 website promises a kickoff keynote that gets underway at 1 p.m. ET/
                          10 a.m. PT/ 6 p.m. BST on May 10. A developer keynote will follow afterward, diving into more
                          detail on tools available to Google developers. You can find a full Google I/O 2013 schedule
                          listing the different presentations. The Google I/O 2023 agenda doesn't provide any specific
                          details about what's in store on May 10. But we can make some educated guesses about what's on tap,
                          given Google's past announcements and rumors about the company's current plans. Google Bard is just
                          the start of the company's grand plans for AI-powered search. According to a report in The New York
                          Times, Samsung is considering ditching Google as the default search engine for its devices in favor
                          of Bing. And Google is feverishly working on the next stage of its search engine which will
                          integrate a chatbot. Dubbed Project Magi, Google has reportedly devoted a large portion of its
                          staff to accelerating the implementation of AI into its search engine.

                          Google I/O, or simply I/O, is an annual developer conference held by Google in Mountain View,
                          California. The name "I/O" is taken from the number googol, with the "I" representing the "1" in
                          googol and the "O" representing the first "0" in the number.[1] The format of the event is similar
                          to Google Developer Day. Google I/O 2020 was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but Google I/O
                          2021 took place online. Google I/O returned to its in-person format in 2022; Google I/O 2022 took
                          place as an in-person conference for the first time since the one held in 2019. Major topics

                          I/O 2023 will provide more details on these projects and may also offer insights on many other
                          upcoming ones that Google is working on behind the scenes. Google showcased the Pixel Tablet last
                          year at I/O 2022, and then again during the Pixel launch event in October. There aren't many
                          surprises left, but we should finally find out the price and launch date. For context, the device
                          is not meant to compete with the Galaxy Tab series but will instead be targeted at those looking
                          for a basic tablet to keep at home for everyday use. I/O 2023 will also give us better insights
                          into all the new bells and whistles of Android 14, especially new privacy and security features.
                          We're not expecting Android 14 to be a major update by any means, but we did see some minor but
                          nifty features in the Android 14 Beta 1. Google released its debut smartwatch, the Pixel Watch, at
                          I/O last year... and it's not great. The device suffers from poor battery life, a small screen,
                          huge bezels, and has some features locked behind a subscription paywall. All that's on top of the
                          hefty $350 price tag. Suffice to say, we're expecting the Pixel Watch 2 to be better in every way.
                          The Pixel 7a, Pixel Fold, Pixel Watch 2, and Pixel Tablet will be among the many things Google will
                          talk about at I/O 2023.

                          movie adaptation of “Irredeemable” from Boom! Comics. “Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters”
                          writer-director Tommy Wirkola is writing the screenplay. McKay and Charles Randolph won the best
                          adapted screenplay Oscar for “The Big Short.” Producers are Boom! Studios’ Ross Richie and Stephen
                          Christy along with Gary Sanchez’s McKay and Kevin Messick. Adam Yoelin is a co-producer. Boom! has
                          a first-look deal at Fox. The comic-book, written by Mark Waid, was published between 2009 and 2012
                          for a total of 37 issues and centered on fallen superhero the Plutonian, who begins slaughtering
                          the population of Earth. His former allies, the superhero group the Paradigm, attempt to find a way
                          to stop his rampage but none of them are as powerful as the maniac holding the world hostage. The

                          carnage.” This sounds like a fun premise, and definitely swims in the darkness that McKay has shown
                          he can handle with The Big Short. However, I’m a bit pessimistic on the choice for writing the
                          script.

                          hovering and obstacle avoidance test for the Mars Lander of China's first Mars exploration mission
                          at the extraterrestrial celestial landing test site. It was the first public appearance of China's
                          Mars exploration mission.[46] As the mission preparation proceeded, in April 2020, the mission was
                          formally named "Tianwen-1".[47] On 23 July 2020, Tianwen-1 was launched from Wenchang Spacecraft
                          Launch Site on the island of Hainan atop a Long March 5 heavy-lift launch vehicle.[22] In September
                          2020, the Tianwen-1 orbiter deployed the Tianwen-1 First Deployable Camera (TDC-1), a small
                          satellite with two cameras that took photos of and tested a radio connection with Tianwen-1.[10]
                          Its mission was to photograph the Tianwen-1 orbiter and the lander's heat shield.[10] Due to the
                          time when it was deployed, it trajectory predicted to do a flyby of Mars with that happening around
                          the orbit insertion date. During its cruise to Mars, the spacecraft completed four trajectory
                          correction maneuvers plus an additional maneuver to alter its heliocentric orbital inclination; it
                          also performed self diagnostics on multiple payloads.

                          Shad Gaspard has been posthumously named the recipient of the 2022 Warrior Award. Named after WWE
                          Hall of Famer The Ultimate Warrior, The Warrior Award is presented to an individual who has
                          exhibited unwavering strength and perseverance and who lives life with the courage and compassion
                          that embodies the indomitable spirit of The Ultimate Warrior. The news was first reported by
                          Foxsports.com. The Warrior Award presentation will be part of the WWE Hall of Fame Induction

                          statement. When I review a particularly ugly Windows laptop, I’ll often refer to it as having a
                          “laptop cart” look. If you were a student at any point after the early 2000s, you probably
                          understand why. The laptops that schools provide to elementary and middle school kids are famously
                          ugly, old, and terrible in all kinds of ways. With the Surface Laptop SE, which is tailor-made for
                          education and being sold only to schools, Microsoft is trying a different tack. The Surface Laptop
                          SE is a cute laptop. It looks like a miniature version of the company’s flagship Surface Laptop
                          line, complete with the recognizable logo on the lid and bottom bezel. It’s quite light, at just
                          2.45 pounds. Unlike many clunky school models out there, this is a device I can easily see
                          appealing to adults in the consumer space. If it weren’t so dang slow. I’m not gonna hold back
                          here: this is the slowest computer I’ve ever used.

                          claims he did so by using a 'different' ten percent of his brain. Additionally, Raymond Lee appears

                          the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences barred Smith from attending any Academy events,
                          including the Oscars, for 10 years. "The Board has decided, for a period of 10 years from April 8,
                          2022, Mr. Smith shall not be permitted to attend any Academy events or programs, in person or
                          virtually, including but not limited to the Academy Awards," the organization said in a statement.
                          Smith had resigned from the Academy a week before the Academy's disciplinary actions were
                          announced. 2022 Oscars:Will Smith won best actor for 'King Richard' Sunday night. But at what cost?

                          Carolina. "When he slapped Chris, he slapped all of us. He really slapped me," she said. "Because
                          when you hurt my child, you hurt me." Questlove, who won the Academy Award for best documentary

                          Awards while presenting an award. "I'm going to present this award and I trust that you people will
                          stay 500 feet away from me. Just playing," he told the audience.

                          works. The M2 chip is here, ushering in the second generation of Apple's bespoke silicon The Apple
                          M2 chip was unveiled at Apple's WWDC 2022 keynote on June 6, and it's the inaugural chip in Apple's
                          second generation of bespoke silicon. This is significant because the M2 is an evolution of the
                          remarkable M1 chip that debuted in 2020, and it powers Apple's new 13-inch MacBook Air 2022 and
                          MacBook Pro 2022. These are successors to two of the best MacBooks on the market, so it's exciting
                          to see what an M2 injection can do. The new Apple M2 chip debuted in two new laptops: the 13-inch
                          MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, which launched in the Summer of 2022. The M2 chip is available in

                          you'll need to pay over $1k to get yourself an M2-powered MacBook. It's also available in the Mac
                          mini M2, a cheaper and more powerful version of Apple's pint-sized Mac. Apple's new M2 chip is

  - Source              :
                          Apple in June 2022 unveiled the M2, its next-generation Apple silicon chip that followed the M1
                          chip. This guide highlights everything you need to know about the M2 chip, from performance
                          improvements to extra features. The M2 is Apple's next-generation System on a Chip (SoC) developed
                          for use in Macs and iPads. It marks Apple's continued work to transition away from the Intel chips
                          that were used in Macs up until 2020. As a "System on a Chip," the M2 integrates several different
                          components, including the CPU, GPU, unified memory architecture (RAM), Neural Engine, Secure
                          Enclave, SSD controller, image signal processor, encode/decode engines, Thunderbolt controller with
                          USB 4 support, and more, all of which power the different features in the Mac. Before Apple
                          silicon, Macs used multiple chips for CPU, I/O, and security, but Apple's effort to integrate these
                          chips is the reason why the M2 is much faster and more efficient than Intel chips. The unified
                          memory architecture that Apple has included is also a major factor because all of the technologies
                          in the M2 are able to access the same data without having to swap between multiple pools of memory.
                          Built into the M2 chip, the unified memory architecture means the CPU, GPU, and other processor
                          components don't need to copy data between one another, and are able to access the same data pool.

                          Rock referenced the 1997 movie “G I Jane,” in which actress Demi Moore shaved her head. Smith
                          slapped Rock in what at first appeared to be a scripted joke. But the theatre turned sombre moments
                          later when Smith, back in his seat, shouted back, “Keep my wife’s name out of your f**king mouth”.
                          The comment was silenced during the live US broadcast on Walt Disney Co’s ABC. Smith later
                          apologised to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and to his fellow nominees as he
                          tearfully accepted the Oscar for best actor for playing the father of Venus and Serena Williams in
                          “King Richard”. “Art imitates life. I look like the crazy father,” he said, “just like they said
                          about Richard Williams.” Jessica Chastain landed the best actress award for playing TV evangelist
                          Tammy Faye Bakker in “The Eyes of Tammy Faye”. In other awards, Jane Campion won the Oscar for best
                          director for her dark Western “Power of the Dog”. Campion, who had been the first woman ever twice
                          nominated in the category (previously for 1993’s “The Piano”), is just the third woman to win best
                          director. It is also the first time the directing award has ever gone to women in back-to-back
                          years after “Nomadland” filmmaker Chloe Zhao won last year.

                          or Arab nation.[245] The final was played on 18 December between Argentina and France. Both teams
                          had won the event twice previously.[246] Early goals from Lionel Messi and Ángel Di María gave
                          Argentina, leading 2–0, a head start against the French.[246][247] Despite multiple substitutions
                          in the first half, France did not record a shot until after the 70th minute but were energised by
                          additional substitutions in the 71st. A few minutes later, France were awarded a penalty as Randal
                          Kolo Muani was brought down in the penalty area by Nicolás Otamendi. Mbappé scored the penalty and
                          added a second goal less than two minutes later to equalise the scores.[247] With the score tied at
                          two goals apiece, the match went to extra time. Messi scored his second goal in the 108th minute,
                          once again giving Argentina the lead. However, Mbappé was awarded a second penalty in the 115th
                          minute after his shot hit the arm of Gonzalo Montiel. Mbappé scored his third goal, becoming the
                          second player ever to complete a hat-trick in the final of a World Cup after Geoff Hurst for
                          England in 1966.[247] With the score tied at 3–3, the match was determined via a penalty shootout.

                          had won the event twice previously.[246] Early goals from Lionel Messi and Ángel Di María gave
                          Argentina, leading 2–0, a head start against the French.[246][247] Despite multiple substitutions
                          in the first half, France did not record a shot until after the 70th minute but were energised by
                          additional substitutions in the 71st. A few minutes later, France were awarded a penalty as Randal
                          Kolo Muani was brought down in the penalty area by Nicolás Otamendi. Mbappé scored the penalty and
                          added a second goal less than two minutes later to equalise the scores.[247] With the score tied at
                          two goals apiece, the match went to extra time. Messi scored his second goal in the 108th minute,
                          once again giving Argentina the lead. However, Mbappé was awarded a second penalty in the 115th
                          minute after his shot hit the arm of Gonzalo Montiel. Mbappé scored his third goal, becoming the
                          second player ever to complete a hat-trick in the final of a World Cup after Geoff Hurst for
                          England in 1966.[247] With the score tied at 3–3, the match was determined via a penalty shootout.

                          same period last year, Tesla delivered 184,800 electric vehicles and produced 180,338 cars. Model 3
                          and Model Y vehicles comprised 95%, or 295,324, of deliveries in the first quarter of 2022,
                          according to Tesla. The company produced 4,641 fewer cars than it delivered during the quarter
                          citing "ongoing supply chain challenges and factory shutdowns." Analysts expected deliveries of
                          317,000 vehicles for the first three months of 2022, according to estimates compiled by FactSet as

                          quarter-on-quarter sales growth was modest despite price cuts as rising competition and a bleak
                          economic outlook weighed. Tesla delivered 422,875 vehicles for the first three months of this year,
                          up 4% from the previous quarter. This was 36% higher than a year ago. In January, Chief Executive
                          Elon Musk said Tesla could achieve 2 million vehicle deliveries this year, up 52% from last year.
                          Investors have been watching Musk's gamble that cutting prices would stimulate sales, although they
                          worry about eroding margins. In January, Tesla slashed prices globally by as much as 20%,
                          unleashing a price war after missing Wall Street delivery estimates for 2022. The basic Model Y
                          that used to sell for $65,990 now costs $54,990. "If they wouldn't have done the price cut, it
                          would have been ugly. I think what it tells you is the economy is getting tough," Gene Munster,

                          ambitious sales targets for Tesla in recent years, said in January that 2023 deliveries could hit 2
                          million vehicles, absent external disruption, from 1.3 million in 2022.

                          Scottie Scheffler won the 2022 Masters on Sunday following a dominant performance at Augusta
                          National. The world No. 1 finished ahead of Northern Irishman Rory McIlroy to claim his first major
                          title. After two close-range misses on the 18th green, he rolled home the winning putt and carded a
                          final round one-under par 71 to finish on 10-under for the tournament, three shots ahead of
                          second-placed McIlroy. Over the four days at the lush, sprawling golf club in Augusta, Georgia,
                          Scheffler produced some excellent golf, refusing to falter under the pressure of being the
                          tournament’s leader for nearly three days. In the end, he was rewarded for his recent run of good
                          form, winning the most prestigious tournament title out there, as well as going home with the
                          famous green jacket and the $2.7 million winners purse. Asked how he felt in the immediate
                          aftermath, Scheffler said he was “pretty tired.” “I want to go home! I’m pretty tired right now –
                          I’m really at a loss for words right now,” he said. “I can’t thank my family enough – they’ve made
                          many sacrifices over the years. To have the honor of winning the tournament and to have my family
                          with me was incredible.” The last two months have been transformative for Scheffler.

                          Over the next several hours, Scheffler, 25, rebuffed every challenge with the same aplomb to claim
                          his first major championship, running away to win the 2022 Masters by three strokes. His margin of
                          victory would have been larger but for a final show of some nerves during the tournament’s closing
                          sequence on the 18th green, when Scheffler needed four putts, including three from less than five
                          feet, to close out a round of 71. Scheffler finished 10 under par for the tournament, in just his
                          third Masters appearance. Rory McIlroy, who trailed Scheffler by 10 strokes heading into the final
                          round, finished second after an eight-under-par 64. Smith and Shane Lowry tied for third, five
                          strokes off the lead. Speaking with reporters after donning the ceremonial green jacket awarded to
                          Masters winners, Scheffler talked of feeling calm on the course during the final round but said he
                          was “so stressed out” on Sunday morning. “I cried like a baby,” he said. “I was so overwhelmed.”
                          Scheffler added that he told his wife, Meredith, “I don’t think I’m ready for this.” Scheffler said
                          he could not recall any previous episodes of self-doubt and attributed it to an understanding of
                          how much winning the Masters would mean to him. “I’ve felt at peace on the golf course,” he said,
                          laughing.

                          Scottie Scheffler won the 2022 Masters on Sunday following a dominant performance at Augusta
                          National. The world No. 1 finished ahead of Northern Irishman Rory McIlroy to claim his first major
                          title. After two close-range misses on the 18th green, he rolled home the winning putt and carded a
                          final round one-under par 71 to finish on 10-under for the tournament, three shots ahead of
                          second-placed McIlroy. Over the four days at the lush, sprawling golf club in Augusta, Georgia,
                          Scheffler produced some excellent golf, refusing to falter under the pressure of being the
                          tournament’s leader for nearly three days. In the end, he was rewarded for his recent run of good
                          form, winning the most prestigious tournament title out there, as well as going home with the
                          famous green jacket and the $2.7 million winners purse. Asked how he felt in the immediate
                          aftermath, Scheffler said he was “pretty tired.” “I want to go home! I’m pretty tired right now –
                          I’m really at a loss for words right now,” he said. “I can’t thank my family enough – they’ve made
                          many sacrifices over the years. To have the honor of winning the tournament and to have my family
                          with me was incredible.” The last two months have been transformative for Scheffler.

Question 52              : Who won the women's singles Australian Open 2022?
Correct Answers         :  
                          Ashleigh Barty

                          The 2022 Australian Open was a Grand Slam tennis tournament that took place at Melbourne Park,
                          Australia from 17 to 30 January 2022.[2] It was the 110th edition of the Australian Open, the 54th
                          in the Open Era, and the first Grand Slam of the year. The tournament consisted of events for
                          professional players in singles, doubles and mixed doubles. Junior and wheelchair players competed
                          in singles and doubles tournaments. As in previous years, the tournament's main sponsor was Kia.
                          The men's singles title was won by Rafael Nadal, and was Nadal's 21st major title, and his second
                          Australian Open. He defeated second seed Daniil Medvedev in the final, winning in five sets after
                          being two sets down. In winning the title, Nadal broke the record for all-time men's major singles
                          title - it was previously tied at 20 between himself, Novak Djokovic, and Roger Federer. The
                          women's singles title was won by Ashleigh Barty, who won her first Australian Open title and third
                          major title. She defeated 27th seed Danielle Collins in straight sets. Barty was the first
                          Australian to win the title since Chris O'Neil won the title in 1978. The final would also prove to
                          be Barty's last professional match, with Barty announcing her retirement in March 2022.

                          Aryna Sabalenka defeated Elena Rybakina in the final, 4–6, 6–3, 6–4 to win the women's singles
                          tennis title at the 2023 Australian Open. It was her first major singles title.[1] Sabalenka
                          dropped just one set during the tournament, to Rybakina in the championship match. Rybakina became
                          the first Kazakhstani player to progress past the fourth round, and the first player since Jennifer
                          Capriati in 2001 to defeat three consecutive major champions in a single edition of the Australian
                          Open.[2] By reaching the final, Rybakina made her debut in the top ten of the WTA Rankings.
                          Ashleigh Barty was the reigning champion,[3] but she retired from professional tennis in March
                          2022.[4] Barty's retirement and Angelique Kerber and Naomi Osaka’s absences (both due to pregnancy)
                          meant that Victoria Azarenka and Sofia Kenin were the only former champions left in the draw. They
                          met in the first round, with Azarenka winning in straight sets.[5] Jeļena Ostapenko became the

                          finishes the point with a crosscourt forehand winner - 15-all. Wide serve into the deuce court and
                          yet again, Rybakina’s forehand return is beyond the baseline. Rybakina reads the crosscourt drop

                          from Sabalenka and she has her third set point. A T ace on second serve and Sabalenka wins second
                          set 6-3! Sabalenka 5-3 Rybakina* - Rybakina serving to stay in the set. The Kazakh misses the inner
                          sideline by a whisker as she goes for an inside-out backhand. Deep backhand return from Sabalenka
                          and Rybakina’s backhand in reply is well long.

                          can stop him. He had a breakthrough year in 2022. He won the Australian Open doubles with Thanasi
                          Kokkinakis then made the Wimbledon singles final, where he famously wore his red hat to the awards
                          ceremony. He followed it up with singles and doubles victories at the Citi Open. And who can forget
                          the tactically brilliant four-set win against Medvedev in the fourth round of the US Open last
                          year? The Australian Open is his home Slam too, so he might not stop until he wins the whole thing
                          -- and then, who knows, he might just retire, as he keeps hinting. Maine: Those who were paying
                          close attention in 2022 might not be surprised by this, especially not after the fourth-round
                          challenge she presented to Swiatek at the French Open, but Qinwen Zheng seems poised for another
                          huge year, and it feels like that could start in Melbourne.

                          She has talked about the value of maintaining low expectations, taking things day by day, even
                          though her ambitions make it so difficult. She has been frank about the possible outcomes here,
                          including the fact that losing is an option that should be prepared for, one that would not be a
                          tragedy. Quite the final we have on Philippe Chatrier today, a battle between an irresistible force
                          in Iga Swiatek and irresistible charm in Coco Gauff. It’s also a battle between two members of the
                          younger generation on the women’s tour. Swiatek, the 2020 French Open champion, while Gauff is
                          still just 18, having charmed the tennis world in 2018 with her Wimbledon run. It’s her first grand
                          slam final, though she has also reached the women’s doubles final this year at Roland Garros. To
                          land the French title, Gauff must beat a player on a 34-match winning streak, going for a sixth
                          title in succession, and therefore upset the odds, though she has yet to drop a set this year in
                          Paris. This could be a classic, and three sets of tennis must be expected. We start at 2pm UK time.

                          the 2022 French Open.[1] It was her second French Open title, and she dropped just one set en
                          route, in the fourth round to Zheng Qinwen. With the win, Świątek extended her winning streak to 35
                          matches (dating back to the Qatar Open in February), equaling Venus Williams' tally from the 2000
                          season.[2] Świątek also became the youngest winner of multiple majors since Maria Sharapova in
                          2006.[3] Barbora Krejčíková was the defending champion,[4] but she lost in the first round to Diane
                          Parry. This marked only the third time in French Open history that the defending champion lost in
                          the first round (after Anastasia Myskina in 2005 and Jeļena Ostapenko in 2018), and the record
                          fifteenth consecutive unsuccessful French Open women's singles title defense since 2007.[5]
                          17-year-old Linda Nosková became the youngest qualifier to debut in the main draw since Michelle
                          Larcher de Brito in 2009.[6][7][8][9] This was the second time in the Open Era when only one out of
                          the top ten seeds advanced to the fourth round of a major, after 2018 Wimbledon.[10]

                          Gauff, an 18-year-old from Delray Beach, Florida, was disappointed after the loss, but talked about
                          how this match -- and her run to the final -- has helped boost her confidence. "For a while I
                          really believed I couldn't do it just because ever since I was 15 and I first came on people had so
                          much expectations for me and I started to believe that I couldn't do it and you know I made a final
                          and I wasn't expecting it and I know that I'll get this opportunity again and I hope that I can
                          come out on top next time. The numbers tell the story of a dominant and composed match for Swiatek
                          -- which was the story of her tournament and could be the tag line for her last three months of
                          tennis. 73% first serves in, 72% win rate on first serves, 5-for-10 in break point chances, just 16
                          unforced errors. On the other side of the court Gauff struggled on her first serve, winning just
                          46% of her first serve points and coming away with three double faults and 23 unforced errors and
                          21 forced errors. The next big tournament on the tennis calendar is Wimbledon, which starts June
                          27. Ash Barty, who retired earlier this year, won the women's singles in 2021.

                          She also liked that she didn’t have to worry about any gusts or the sun or anything else while
                          playing — a reminder of days practicing at indoor courts during winters in Prague. “I always play
                          good indoors,” Vondrousova said. “I was like, ‘Yeah, maybe that’s going to help me.’” On this
                          afternoon, she trailed in each set but collected the last four games of the first, then the last
                          three games of the second as Jabeur fell to 0-3 in major finals. The 28-year-old from Tunisia is
                          the only Arab woman and only North African woman to make it that far in singles at any Grand Slam
                          tournament. “You cannot force things,” the sixth-seeded Jabeur said. “It wasn’t meant to be.” She
                          lost to Elena Rybakina 12 months ago at the All England Club and to No. 1 Iga Swiatek at the U.S.
                          Open last September. “I think this is the most painful loss of my career,” Jabeur said Saturday,
                          pausing to wipe away tears. Vondrousova’s surge to her Slam title was hard to envision at the start
                          of this fortnight. She was 1-4 in previous appearances on Wimbledon’s grass, only once making it as
                          far as the second round, before going 7-0 on a run that included wins against five seeded foes.

                          Three-time defending champion Novak Djokovic defeated Nick Kyrgios in the final, 4–6, 6–3, 6–4,
                          7–6(7–3) to win the gentlemen's singles tennis title at the 2022 Wimbledon Championships. It was
                          his seventh Wimbledon title and 21st major singles title overall.[1] Djokovic became the fifth man
                          in the Open Era to record a streak of at least four consecutive titles at one major.[2] By reaching
                          his 32nd men's singles major final, he surpassed the all-time record he had jointly held with Roger
                          Federer.[3] Djokovic also became the first player (male or female) to win 80 matches at all four
                          majors with his first-round win over Kwon Soon-woo.[4] Because no ranking points were awarded for
                          the tournament in response to its banning of Russian and Belarusian players, Djokovic dropped out
                          of the top five in ATP rankings after the tournament.[5] Kyrgios became the first unseeded man to
                          reach a major final since Jo-Wilfried Tsonga at the 2008 Australian Open, the first Australian man
                          to reach a major final since Lleyton Hewitt at the 2005 Australian Open, and the first unseeded or
                          Australian man to reach the Wimbledon final since Mark Philippoussis in 2003.[6]

                          her the first woman representing Kazakhstan to win a major tournament. She was born in Russia --

                          nation's tennis federation offered her more support than she found in her home country. Jabeur,
                          meanwhile, was the first Arab woman and African-born player to reach a Grand Slam final. Ladies No.
                          1 seed Iga Swiatek saw her wining streak come to an end with a third round loss to Alizé Cornet.

                          Cornet's win put her in the fourth round at Wimbledon for the first time since 2014. Serena
                          Williams took the court for the first time since the 2021 installment of Wimbledon on June 28. She
                          had not played since last June, when she suffered a hamstring injury during her opening-round match

Question 68              : Who is the new head coach of the Virginia Tech football team in 2022?

                          Brent Pry

  - Source              :
                          64 BLACKSBURG, Va. — Amid the excitement and fanfare of a new head coach comes an uncomfortable
                          side of things too. The previous regime at Virginia Tech wasn’t cutting it, nor were some of the
                          players. It’s how a program once revered for its consistent ability to win 10 games a year finishes
                          under .500 in three of the past four seasons. Advertisement So for new Hokies head coach Brent Pry,
                          chief among his tasks is to be open and honest with players about where they fit in the new world
                          order, what their role is and, in some cases, whether he thinks they’re good enough to play at
                          Virginia Tech. “We can’t be afraid of hard conversations,” Pry said. “Everybody in here has
                          weaknesses, including myself. It’s about staring at those head-on and addressing them and let’s go
                          work through them and strengthen them.” In that spirit, here’s a hard conversation for Hokies fans:
                          This season could be a rough one. That’s not a commentary on Pry’s long-term viability as Tech’s
                          coach. The early returns seem positive, with Pry saying and doing all the right things and sowing
                          the seeds with how he and his staff are re-establishing themselves in the state on the recruiting
                          trail after many of those relationships atrophied in the Justin Fuente era. But this roster isn’t
                          in a quick-fix situation.

                          from Woodbridge used to get asked when strolling through campus or nearby neighborhoods how
                          relatable Fuente was to his players, with fans expressing their distaste for the former coach.
                          “That’s one thing I thought was crazy because last year, the year before, we would walk around, and
                          people would be like: ‘Do you like Fuente? Because I don’t,’ ” Dzansi said. “And now it’s like:

                          been only Pry’s vibrant personality that has energized the Hokies, who last season finished 12th

                          also brings credentials that include directing the Nittany Lions to a national ranking of sixth in

                          Reserve[1]) took place on Saturday, May 7, 2022, at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky. It was
                          the 148th running of the Kentucky Derby, a 1+1⁄4 miles (2.0 km) Grade I stakes race for
                          three-year-old Thoroughbreds. The Derby is held annually at Churchill Downs on the first Saturday
                          in May since its inception in 1875. The 20 horses that ran in the Derby qualified by earning points
                          in the 2022 Road to the Kentucky Derby. The two favorites for the 2022 Kentucky Derby were
                          Epicenter, the winner of the Louisiana Derby, and Zandon, the winner of the Blue Grass Stakes. Both

                          Entering the race at odds of 80–1, Rich Strike's victory was the second-largest upset in Derby
                          history. It was the first Kentucky Derby victory for his trainer Eric Reed, as well as the first
                          graded stakes win in any race for his jockey Sonny Leon. Participation in the Kentucky Derby is
                          restricted to three-year-old Thoroughbreds.

                          Only three horses in the Derby had previously raced on an "off" track, and such precipitation had
                          the chance to alter the race dynamics.[36] However, the rain held off. By the time horses reached
                          the post, the weather at Churchill Downs was 62 °F (17 °C) with cloudy skies and 10 mph (16 km/h)
                          winds. The track condition was listed as fast.[37] The listed attendance for the 2022 Kentucky
                          Derby was 147,294.[38] This was an increase over the previous year, when ticket sales were
                          restricted due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, but below the expected crowd of
                          170,000.[39][40] Coverage of the Derby was broadcast on USA Network from noon to 2:30 p.m. (ET) and
                          then moved to NBC until 7:30 p.m. (ET). The race was also broadcast online through Peacock,
                          NBCSports.com, and the NBC Sports app.[6] Summer is Tomorrow took an early lead out of the gates,
                          setting a Derby record by running the first quarter-mile in 21.78 seconds.[41][42] Crown Pride kept
                          apace with Summer is Tomorrow through the first half-mile, run in 45.36 seconds, with Messier
                          following close behind.[43] Messier took the lead at the 3⁄4-mile mark but was soon overtaken by
                          Epicenter at the head of the stretch.

                          The initial months of 2021 were not favorable for automakers. Semiconductor shortages derailed the
                          post-COVID recovery, affecting vehicle sales worldwide. But the shortages have eased a bit one year
                          later and auto sales are reviving. Automakers expect to recover the losses made during the last two
                          years, soon. However, traditional automakers are unable to cope with the rising demand for pure
                          EVs, whereas Tesla’s ability to address this demand has rewarded it not only with higher vehicle
                          sales in Q1 2022 but also a record revenue of $18.8 billion. Tesla has also started deliveries to
                          car rental service provider Hertz against its huge 100,000-vehicle order, which is also a reason
                          for high vehicle production and delivery during the quarter. Tesla’s Q1 2022 revenue would have
                          been more without the fresh COVID wave that has hit Shanghai and surrounding areas, affecting the
                          company’s production there. From the second week of March, rising cases of a new COVID variant have
                          forced automakers operating around Shanghai to suspend production. The urge to achieve L4 autonomy
                          by the end of 2023 and to roll out robotaxis by early 2025 can be a major reason for Tesla’s big
                          R&D spend. Besides, Tesla could also be conducting research on developing new battery chemistry.
                          The soaring prices of some key battery components like nickel and lithium have put the auto OEMs in
                          a spot.

                          However, the company has faced numerous challenges due to global supply chain disruptions. Those
                          challenges, which include the global semiconductor shortage, continue to persist. Tesla was even
                          forced to shutter its Shanghai factory in late March due to an outbreak of COVID-19 in the region.
                          The company began preparing to reopen the plant earlier this week. However, the reopening will be
                          under modified conditions where workers will have to live onsite to comply with China's "closed
                          loop management" process for limiting the spread of the coronavirus. Tesla said that it has made
                          adjustments to its product pricing due to inflationary pressures on its cost structure. However, it
                          has been able to reduce its cost of goods sold (COGS) per vehicle despite the inflationary
                          pressures. That helped to drive its profitability during the quarter. During an earnings call after
                          results were announced, Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Zachary Kirkhorn and Chief Executive Officer
                          (CEO) Elon Musk said the company remains confident that it can increase volume at least 50%
                          compared to 2021 numbers. However, the executives said that Tesla has lost about a month of “build
                          volume” in Shanghai in the wake of shutdowns imposed by China's central government due to the
                          increase in COVID-19 cases. “Production is resuming at limited levels, and we’re working to get
                          back to full production as quickly as possible,” Kirkhorn said.

                          By Anthony D'Alessandro Editorial Director/Box Office Editor EXCLUSIVE: There’s been a lot of
                          biting rumors around STX Entertainment during the past four months, from a potential sale to
                          Lionsgate to possibly filing Chapter 11. These are not coming to realization as the Hustlers and
                          Bad Moms studio now can breathe a sigh of relief, having fully closed its sale to The Najafi
                          Companies, with Birch Grove LP and 777 Partners now also providing financing. The Forest Road
                          Company originally was part of the Najafi consortium in taking over STX’s debt, but it no longer is
                          part of the revived studio going forward. All of this puts STX Entertainment in a position to
                          remain independent, now completely separated from Eros International, which we’ve heard has had its
                          own financial baggage, further complicating affairs for the Burbank studio. All of this is good for
                          the greater independent film ecosphere as STX won’t be a theatrical distributor to bite the dust in
                          an industry still obsessed with streaming as the pandemic eases. Related Stories Corporate Affairs

                          Lionsgate to possibly filing Chapter 11. These are not coming to realization as the Hustlers and
                          Bad Moms studio now can breathe a sigh of relief, having fully closed its sale to The Najafi
                          Companies, with Birch Grove LP and 777 Partners now also providing financing. The Forest Road
                          Company originally was part of the Najafi consortium in taking over STX’s debt, but it no longer is
                          part of the revived studio going forward. All of this puts STX Entertainment in a position to
                          remain independent, now completely separated from Eros International, which we’ve heard has had its
                          own financial baggage, further complicating affairs for the Burbank studio. All of this is good for
                          the greater independent film ecosphere as STX won’t be a theatrical distributor to bite the dust in
                          an industry still obsessed with streaming as the pandemic eases. Related Stories Corporate Affairs

                          longest-serving senator from Utah, died Saturday. He was 88. Hatch served 42 years in the Senate,
                          from 1977 to 2019, including time as the president pro tempore of the chamber, a ceremonial
                          leadership position typically reserved for senior members. He was known for working across the
                          aisle, and the late U.S. Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., was one of his closest friends. "At the time of
                          his retirement, Senator Hatch held the distinction of having passed more legislation into law than
                          any other Senator then alive," said a statement Saturday from the Orrin G. Hatch Foundation.
                          "Through his relentless work ethic, Hatch earned a reputation as one of the most effective and

                          Discovery head of streaming JB Perrette and now-CNN Chief Operating Officer David Leavy, were
                          skeptical of spending hundreds of millions of dollars on niche or half-baked content ideas like
                          "Jake Tapper's Book Club" and "Parental Guidance with Anderson Cooper." Leavy is now part of the
                          executive team that will help Zaslav find a new CEO. Zaslav thought CNN+ was a waste of resources
                          for a company saddled with $50 billion of debt that needed to boost free cash flow and generate $3
                          billion in merger-related synergies. But before he made any decisions, he wanted to hear Licht's
                          thoughts. Licht was supposed to begin his job May 2, 2022, but he started a few weeks early to
                          weigh in on CNN+. In several virtual conferences, he met with CNN+ head Andrew Morse, CNN+ general
                          manager Alex MacCallum and CNN Chief Tech Officer Robyn Peterson, according to people familiar with
                          the matter who declined to be identified due to the private nature of the talks. Perrette and
                          Discovery streaming CFO Neil Chugani (who would become CNN's CFO) were also there. Licht expressed
                          his skepticism with the product's programming, according to people in the meeting. The discussion
                          centered around the viability of offering a product named after CNN without actually featuring a
                          live feed of the network's cable programming. Perrette told the CNN+ leadership to pause all
                          marketing spending and not to launch on Roku.

Question 77              : What is the megapixel in main camera on the iPhone 14 Pro?
Correct Answers         :

  - Source              :
                          Well ahead of Apple’s event last month, there had been rumors that this long era — 7 years is a
                          practical century in technology time — was about to come to an end. Indeed, iPhone 14 Pro was
                          announced with a 48 megapixel camera. Looking purely at the specs, it’s an impressive upgrade: the
                          sensor is significantly larger in size, not just resolution. The lens is slightly slower (that is,
                          its aperture isn’t quite as large as the previous years’) but once again, the overall
                          light-gathering ability of the iPhone’s main shooter improves by as much as 33%. The implications
                          are clear: more pixels for more resolution; more light gathered for better low light shots, and
                          finally, a bigger sensor for improvements in all areas including more shallow depth of field.
                          There’s a reason we chase the dragon of larger sensors in cameras; they allow for all our favorite
                          photography subjects: details, low light and night shots, and nice bokeh. Your average digital
                          camera sensor has a particularly interesting way to capture color. We’ve previously detailed this

                          a camera sensor contains tiny pixels that can detect how much light comes in. For a dark area of an
                          image, it will register darkness accurately, and vice versa for lighter areas.

                          Apple did not go into great detail about the camera hardware changes here, but thankfully
                          Techinsights took the entire camera package apart. The new sensor, at 40mm², is almost 50% larger
                          than the iPhone 13 Pro’s 26.9 mm² sensor. While its aperture is slightly ‘slower’ (that is,
                          smaller) the larger sensor compensates. How does the sensor and lens change stack up in practice?
                          The iPhone 14 Pro easily outperforms the previous iPhone, creating far sharper shots: In multiple
                          shots in various conditions, the shots were far more detailed and exhibited less visible processing
                          than comparable iPhone 13 Pro shots: A nice side benefit of a larger sensor is a bit more shallow
                          depth of field. At a 13mm full-frame equivalent, you really can’t expect too much subject
                          separation, but this shot shows some nice blurry figures in the background. I believe that both
                          Apple’s new Photonic Engine and the larger sensor are contributing to a lot more detail in the
                          frame, which makes a cropped image like the above shot possible. The ‘my point of view’ perspective
                          that the ultra-wide provides puts you in the action, and a lack of detail makes every shot less
                          immersive. Is it all perfect? Well, comparably, with the main camera getting ever-better, it is
                          still fairly soft and lacking detail. Its 12 megapixel resolution is suddenly feeling almost
                          restrictive.

                          Well ahead of Apple’s event last month, there had been rumors that this long era — 7 years is a
                          practical century in technology time — was about to come to an end. Indeed, iPhone 14 Pro was
                          announced with a 48 megapixel camera. Looking purely at the specs, it’s an impressive upgrade: the
                          sensor is significantly larger in size, not just resolution. The lens is slightly slower (that is,
                          its aperture isn’t quite as large as the previous years’) but once again, the overall
                          light-gathering ability of the iPhone’s main shooter improves by as much as 33%. The implications
                          are clear: more pixels for more resolution; more light gathered for better low light shots, and
                          finally, a bigger sensor for improvements in all areas including more shallow depth of field.

                          Fashionistas, mark your calendars: The first Monday in May is quickly approaching. What makes this
                          Monday different from every other? Why, it's the most fashion-forward holiday of the year: the Met
                          Gala. You might be thinking, "But didn't they just have the Met Gala?" If so, you'd be correct. The
                          event was last held eight months ago in September -- when we saw Kim Kardashian's masked Balenciaga
                          look, Lil Nas X's three-part wardrobe transformation and Rihanna and A$AP Rocky's red-carpet debut
                          as a couple -- and the second part will take place on the traditional date. Want to make sure
                          you've got all the stylish details in order before the big night? E! News can help. Here's
                          everything you need to know about the 2022 Met Gala. The 2022 Met Gala will take place May 2. The
                          name of the event is a bit of a giveaway. The chic celebration will be held at New York's
                          Metropolitan Museum of Art, specifically in the American Wing period rooms that showcase American
                          architecture and furnishings spanning from the 17th to 20th centuries to give a glimpse into these
                          time periods. Part one was "In America: A Lexicon in Fashion" -- marking the Costume Institute's
                          75th anniversary and establishing a "modern vocabulary of fashion," according to the organization's
                          press release.

                          All rounds were best-of-seven series; a series ended when one team won four games, and that team
                          advanced to the next round. All rounds, including the NBA Finals, were in a 2–2–1–1–1 format with
                          regards to hosting. In the conference playoffs, home court advantage went to the higher-seeded team
                          (number one being the highest). Conference seedings were ignored for the NBA Finals: home court
                          advantage went to the team with the better regular season record, and, if needed, ties were broken
                          based on head-to-head record, followed by intra-conference record. On March 9, 2022, the Phoenix
                          Suns became the first team to clinch a playoff spot.[13] On April 5, the San Antonio Spurs and New
                          Orleans Pelicans became the last two teams to qualify for postseason play, as both teams secured
                          spots in the first-stage play-in tournament. On April 7, the Denver Nuggets became the final team
                          to secure a direct berth in the playoff bracket, qualifying as the sixth seed in the Western
                          Conference and relegating the Minnesota Timberwolves to the play-in tournament.[14] While noted in
                          the below tables, division titles have no bearing on seeding.[15] Seeds 7 and 8 in each conference
                          were determined via the first-stage play-in tournament, held April 12–15.

                          Netflix's shares took a big hit this week, with the stock price plummeting 26% after reporting it
                          lost about 200,000 subscribers in its first quarter, falling well below expectations. The company

                          These missions are only available as free-to-play game modes during specific seasons, but Blizzard
                          will offer to buy permanent access to these missions separately or as part of a battle pass
                          bundle.[11] Overwatch 2 was announced at BlizzCon on November 1, 2019, with plans that the game
                          would maintain a "shared multiplayer environment" between it and the original Overwatch, so that
                          players in either game could compete in the existing player versus player (PvP) game modes,
                          retaining all unlocked cosmetics and other features.[12] Jeff Kaplan, director for Overwatch,
                          explained that this was a major decision and that he had to justify this "player-first standpoint"
                          to Blizzard executives, given the current industry trend to draw in new sales.[13] All new heroes,
                          maps, and PvP modes were to be added to both games to maintain this shared environment.[14]
                          However, Overwatch 2 was later announced as a free-to-play title, and that on its release on
                          October 4, 2022, Blizzard affirmed that Overwatch 2 live services would replace those of the
                          original game; the original Overwatch servers would be shut down on October 2, 2022.[15] Players
                          retained their existing cosmetics and in-game currency, with remaining loot boxes opened
                          automatically upon the release of Overwatch 2.

Question 85              : How much was Apple's revenue in Q3? 2022
Correct Answers         :  
                          83 billion, 83.0 billion
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prediction (only positive):
  - Answer              : $83.0 billion

  - Source              :
                          Apple today officially reported its earnings for the third fiscal quarter of 2022, covering the
                          second calendar quarter and the months of April, May, and June. A lot of eyes are on Apple as
                          concerns mount over an economic downturn in the United States. Here’s what the company reported
                          today. For Q3 2022, Apple reported revenue of $83.0 billion and a profit of $19.4 billion.
                          Earnings-per-share hit $1.20 for the quarter. For Q3 2022, analyst predictions for revenue varied;
                          $79.26B at the low end to $88.41B at the high end. The average across 26 analysts, however, was
                          $82.81 billion. Apple had not provided any guidance for Q3 2022, citing ongoing supply chain issues
                          and continued disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, the company had even warned
                          that supply constraints would cost it somewhere in the range of $4 billion to $8 billion in revenue
                          for the quarter. For comparison’s sake, in the same quarter a year ago, Apple reported $81.43
                          billion in revenue and profit of $21.74 billion. It reported earnings-per-share of $1.30. These
                          numbers were boosted heavily by pandemic-induced spending, driven by strong iPad and Mac revenue
                          growth. Apple no longer reports unit sales for any of its products but instead reports a breakdown
                          of revenue by product category.

                          decades-high inflation. Apple's soft growth may suggest that the consumer electronics industry —
                          including leaders like Apple — is headed for a period of slow or no growth. Cook told CNBC that the
                          company is seeing inflation but will continue to make investments. "We do see inflation in our cost
                          structure," Cook said. "We see it in things like logistics and wages and certain silicon components
                          and we're still hiring, but we're doing it on a deliberate basis." Apple's iPhone sales exceeded
                          Wall Street expectations, suggesting that demand for iPhone 13 models remains strong even in the

                          on the Nintendo Switch. This is the fourth instalment in the much-loved Xenoblade series, and the
                          trailer showcases lush landscapes, giant mechons, and grand drama. We love the game, as we explain
                          in our Xenoblade Chronicles 3 review, so be sure to check it out if you’re interested. With the
                          Xenoblade Chronicles 3 release date set for July 29, it means the game is out now. It’s a bit of a
                          blend of the two previous mainline entries, which could have interesting story implications. To
                          learn more about the possibilities, check out our Xenoblade Chronicles 3 Noah, Xenoblade Chronicles

                          series, Xenoblade Chronicles 2, came out back in 2017, the launch year for the Nintendo Switch. In
                          terms of sales, it was very successful and was followed by a remaster of the original Xenoblade.

                          Ben Johnson Published: Jul 29, 2022 Xenoblade Chronicles 3, developed by Monolith Soft, is out now
                          on the Nintendo Switch. This is the fourth instalment in the much-loved Xenoblade series, and the
                          trailer showcases lush landscapes, giant mechons, and grand drama. We love the game, as we explain
                          in our Xenoblade Chronicles 3 review, so be sure to check it out if you’re interested. With the
                          Xenoblade Chronicles 3 release date set for July 29, it means the game is out now. It’s a bit of a
                          blend of the two previous mainline entries, which could have interesting story implications. To
                          learn more about the possibilities, check out our Xenoblade Chronicles 3 Noah, Xenoblade Chronicles
                          3 Mio, or Xenoblade Chronicles 3 characters guides to see what’s going on. The last game in the
                          series, Xenoblade Chronicles 2, came out back in 2017, the launch year for the Nintendo Switch. In
                          terms of sales, it was very successful and was followed by a remaster of the original Xenoblade.
                          Check out our Xenoblade Chronicles 3 trailers page to see if you can spot any clues as to how the
                          stories tie together.

  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          As Emerald recounts early in the film, the very first moving picture was created from photos of a
                          man galloping on a horse, specifically a Black jockey whose name has been lost to — or erased from
                          — history, depending on your perspective. The horse was named Sallie Gardner. Horses have had a
                          long and rocky history in Hollywood. Early Hollywood films put horses through gruelling working
                          conditions, often resulting in injury or death. They were essentially treated as disposable. Now
                          on-set animal action, in the United States at least, is monitored by the nonprofit American Humane.
                          Plus, animals on screen are increasingly computer-generated images or motion capture marvels that
                          fuse digital imagery with human actors, as was the case in the award-winning rebooted Planet of the
                          Apes trilogy starring Andy Serkis as the lead chimpanzee, Caesar. We have both reformed and
                          replaced animals’ work in the making of entertainment. Horses and chimpanzees are now often placed
                          on opposite sides of a perceived line between accepted and unacceptable animal use. Most horses are
                          domesticated and have worked for humans for thousands of years. Their careers, reproduction and
                          social lives are largely controlled by humans. In contrast, although individual chimpanzees have
                          been held captive, their species remains wild.

  - Source              :
                          Here's a guide to that cast and characters they play in Carter, and what they've been in before.
                          Heading up the cast is Joo Won as Carter Lee, later revealed as also going by the name Michael
                          Bane. The film begins with Carter waking up in a blood-soaked bed in Seoul with a cross-shaped scar
                          on the back of his head and no memory of who he is. With a premise similar to Hardcore Henry,
                          Carter also features video game logic in its action sequences. Joo Won is a South Korean actor best
                          known for his roles in television, including the main protagonist in Good Doctor, which is played
                          by Freddie Highmore in the American adaptation. Kim Jong-hyeok is a North Korean General who meets
                          Carter during his mission, providing him transport out of South Korea. General Kim is played by Lee
                          Sung-jae, a veteran South Korean actor with credits in TV and film. Lee’s most notable credit is
                          Barking Dogs Never Bite, a 2000 dark comedy film that was the directorial debut of Bong Joon-ho,
                          whose film Parasite won the 2020 Oscar for Best Picture. The young girl cured of the virus and
                          carrying the life-saving antibodies is Jung Ha-na (Kim Bo-min). Carter is tasked with rescuing
                          Ha-na and bringing her to a North Korean facility where the production of a vaccine can be
                          developed.

  - Answer              : Jim Sheridan
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          Now streaming on: Samuel L. Jackson made news last week by refusing to co-star with 50 Cent in a
                          movie based on the rapper's life. He not only refused, but did it publicly, even though the film is
                          to be directed by six-time Oscar nominee Jim Sheridan ("In America"). A clue to Jackson's thinking
                          may be found in his new film, "Coach Carter," based on the true story of a California high school
                          basketball coach who placed grades ahead of sports. Like Bill Cosby, Jackson is arguing against the
                          anti-intellectual message that success for young black males is better sought in the worlds of rap
                          and sports than in the classroom. There is however another aspect to Jackson's refusal: He said he
                          thought Sheridan wanted him to "lend legitimacy" to 50 Cent's acting debut. He might have something
                          there. Jackson has an authority on the screen; he occupies a character with compelling force,
                          commanding attention and can bring class to a movie. He might, he said, be interested in working
                          with 50 Cent after the rapper makes another five movies or so, and earns his chops. This reasoning
                          may not be fair. Consider the work that Ice Cube did in "Boyz N the Hood" (1991), his first movie
                          and the beginning of a successful acting career. Or look at the promise that Tupac Shakur showed,
                          especially in his last feature, "Gridlock'd" (1997), holding his own with the veteran Tim Roth.

                          August 5. The conversational AI is designed to converse with humans about “nearly any topic.” Like
                          Blender Bot 2, the latest upgrade also features the ability to browse the internet, is trained on
                          the OPT-175B language model (which is 58x the size of Blender Bot 2), and has long-term memory. It
                          also eliminates the limitations such as forgetfulness (which surprisingly makes machine learning
                          models efficient when not used in chatbots). It has self-learning capabilities that allow it “to
                          improve its conversational skills and safety through feedback from people who chat with it,
                          focusing on helpful feedback while avoiding learning from unhelpful or dangerous responses.” Well,
                          yes and no. While it is entirely plausible that the underlying AI tech helps it to ‘learn,’ it
                          seems like Blender Bot 3 cannot differentiate between what is acceptable and what is not. At least
                          that’s what its recent responses to some people conveyed.

                          was shut down in just 48 hoursOpens a new window of its release. Microsoft’s Zo also met a similar

                          GPT3 and OPT-175B are working language models, intended to be used – among other things – for
                          serious commercial enterprises. BlenderBot 3, though, is a bit of a laugh. Hence those open
                          questions about safety. Within a few days of BlenderBot being online and ready to mingle (with
                          Americans only, alas), users were posting some spicy examples of the chatbot’s output. The Wall
                          Street Journal’s Jeff Horwitz found that the bot appeared to have been radicalised by Facebook into
                          supporting Donald Trump as a three-term president: And into bringing antisemitic conspiracy
                          theories up, unprompted: Renee DiResta of the Stanford Internet Observatory found that the bot
                          would claim to be an a supporter of the German paramilitary organisation the Red Army Faction:
                          Pranav Dixit of BuzzFeed News found the bot wants to send Zuckerberg to jail: The whole thing is
                          most reminiscent of Tay, Microsoft’s AI-based learning chatbot, which was released in 2016 and
                          promptly became a Hitler-loving Trump supporter: ‘Tay is designed to engage and entertain people
                          where they connect with each other online through casual and playful conversation,’ Microsoft said.
                          ‘The more you chat with Tay the smarter she gets.’ But it appeared on Thursday that Tay’s
                          conversation extended to racist, inflammatory and political statements.

                          Facebook’s parent company has created a bot capable of weighing in on almost any topic – from
                          radicalisation to sending Mark Zuckerberg to jail Last week, researchers at Facebook’s parent
                          company Meta released BlenderBot 3, a “publicly available chatbot that improves its skills and
                          safety over time”. The chatbot is built on top of Meta’s OPT-175B language model, effectively the
                          company’s white-label version of the more famous GPT-3 AI. Like most state-of-the-art AIs these
                          days, that was trained on a vast corpus of text scraped from the internet in questionable ways, and
                          poured into a datacentre with thousands of expensive chips that turned the text into something
                          approaching coherence. But where OPT-175B is a general-purpose textbot, able to do anything from
                          write fiction and answer questions to generate spam emails, BlenderBot 3 is a narrower project: it
                          can have a conversation with you. That focus allows it to bring in other expertise, though, and one
                          of Meta’s most significant successes is hooking the language model up to the broader internet. In
                          other words: “BlenderBot 3 is capable of searching the internet to chat about virtually any topic.”
                          On top of that, BlenderBot is designed to improve itself through feedback on earlier conversations,
                          whereas large language models like OPT-175B are generally fairly static.

                          ChatGPT is a natural language processing tool driven by AI technology that allows you to have
                          human-like conversations and much more with the chatbot. The language model can answer questions
                          and assist you with tasks, such as composing emails, essays, and code. Also: How to use ChatGPT:
                          What you need to know now It's currently open to use by the public for free because ChatGPT is in
                          its research and feedback-collection phase. A paid subscription version called ChatGPT Plus
                          launched at the beginning of February. ChatGPT was created by OpenAI, an AI and research company.

                          then fine-tuned with reinforcement learning from human and AI feedback for human alignment and

                          Share The day for the release of GPT-4 is getting closer. GPT-3 was announced in May 2020, almost
                          two years ago. It was released one year after GPT-2 — which was also released a year after the
                          original GPT paper was published. If this trend were to hold across versions, GPT-4 should already
                          be here. It’s not, but OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, said a few months ago that GPT-4 is coming.
                          Current estimates forecast the release date sometime in 2022, likely around July-August. Despite
                          being one of the most awaited AI news, there’s little public info about GPT-4: what it’ll be like,
                          its features, or its abilities. Altman conducted a Q&A last year and gave a few hints on OpenAI’s
                          ideas for GPT-4 (he asked participants to be discrete about the info, and I’ve been silent — but

                          Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4) is a multimodal large language model created by
                          OpenAI, and the fourth in its numbered "GPT-n" series of GPT foundation models.[1] It was released
                          on March 14, 2023, and has been made publicly available in a limited form via the chatbot product
                          ChatGPT Plus (a premium version of ChatGPT), and with access to the GPT-4 based version of OpenAI's
                          API being provided via a waitlist.[1] As a transformer based model, GPT-4 was pretrained to predict
                          the next token (using both public data and "data licensed from third-party providers"), and was
                          then fine-tuned with reinforcement learning from human and AI feedback for human alignment and

                          transaction, according to the statement. The purchase would be Amazon’s fourth-largest acquisition
                          after the company bought Whole Foods for $13.7 billion in 2017 and the movie studio MGM for $8.5

                          MLB at Field of Dreams is a recurring Major League Baseball (MLB) regular-season game played in a
                          ballpark adjacent to Field of Dreams in Dyersville, Iowa, a site popularized by the 1989 baseball
                          film Field of Dreams. The first edition of the game was played on August 12, 2021, with the Chicago
                          White Sox defeating the New York Yankees, 9–8. The second edition of the game was played August 11,
                          2022, with the Chicago Cubs defeating the Cincinnati Reds, 4–2. Both games were held on the second
                          Thursday of August. Future games are on hold while a new youth baseball and softball complex is
                          under construction at the Field of Dreams site. The first edition of the game was planned for
                          August 13, 2020, with the Chicago White Sox facing the New York Yankees.[1] However, due to the
                          COVID-19 pandemic, MLB implemented a shortened 2020 season that limited games played to each team's
                          division and the opposite league's geographically equal division to reduce travel. Hence, on July
                          1, MLB announced that the St. Louis Cardinals would replace the Yankees for the game.[2] After
                          several St. Louis players and coaches tested positive for COVID-19 in late July, MLB postponed
                          several Cardinals games, eventually leading the league to announce on August 3 that the MLB at
                          Field of Dreams game would be postponed to the 2021 season.

                          League.[32] On August 9, the Quad Cities River Bandits hosted and defeated the Cedar Rapids
                          Kernels, 7–2.[33] The teams used historical franchise names for the contest, Davenport Blue Sox and
                          Cedar Rapids Bunnies, respectively.[32] MLB will not host a game at the ballpark in 2023 due to
                          construction around the site.[34] Future plans include converting the site into a youth baseball
                          and softball complex that one day would also have a hotel.[35] Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds confirmed
                          that there will be another round of public funding to build a permanent stadium at the site.[36]

                          Windows 11 version 22H2 (2022 Update) is the next major refresh of the Microsoft desktop operating
                          system. Codenamed “Sun Valley 2,” the feature update will continue updating the desktop interface,
                          bringing back previously removed features, and introducing new features and improvements. Although
                          we are still days away from the release date, Microsoft is done adding the new features and changes
                          for the Windows 11 2022 Update. The intended final version of the update is already available in
                          the Release Preview Channel of the Windows Insider Program. This release will include new features
                          like Live Captions and Voice Access. It will also introduce an updated version of File Explorer
                          that brings support for tabs and a redesigned navigation pane, a new way to snap applications on
                          the screen with drag and drop Snap layouts flyout, and redesigned version of Task Manager.
                          Furthermore, you will find many visual updates for legacy elements and more. The final version of
                          Windows 11 22H2 has been available since June 7, 2022, but only as a preview in the Release Preview
                          Channel. The feature update is expected to launch on Tuesday, September 20, 2022 (the update is now
                          live for everyone). The update will be offered as a free upgrade for computers already running the
                          original version.

                          By Susan Bradley, Contributing Writer, Computerworld | Windows 11 22H2, released two weeks ago, is
                          another step closer to being an acceptable upgrade to Windows 10. But many Windows users aren't yet
                          being offered it for download. It's important to understand that we're in the “seeker” era for
                          Windows 11 22H2. Microsoft still has a variety of hardware and third-party issues to work through,
                          which is why you might not get offered 22H2 right away. But there is a mechanism you can use to
                          review any hard blocks on your system. (If you want to get 22H2 sooner rather than later, you could
                          opt into the Insider release track, which ensures you get the beta versions of Windows 11 — but
                          that also exposes your hardware to possible bugs, side effects, and other issues.) Courtesy of Adam
                          Gross, you can use a GitHub script to determine exactly why your system is not being offered 22H2.
                          You can either download the PowerShell script from the Github site or follow these commands to
                          determine what might be blocking Windows 11 22H@ from showing up on your hardware.. First, search
                          for PowerShell and then right-mouse click and run as administrator. In an administrator PowerShell
                          session, type in the following: Install-Module FU.

                          works. Everything we know about AMD's new desktop processors Editor's Note: AMD unveiled a few new
                          CPUs in the Ryzen 7000 line at CES 2023, most notably the Ryzen 7040, the first (and so far only)
                          laptop CPU in the lineup -- and the first AMD laptop CPU to ship with onboard Ryzen AI tech. The
                          AMD Ryzen 7000 desktop processors have arrived. AMD announced the pricing and availability of its
                          upcoming Zen 4 architecture-based CPUs during the company's “Together we advance PCs” live stream
                          in August 2022. As previously revealed during Computex 2022, the new chips will feature TSMC's
                          5-nanometer process and run on AMD's new AM5 platform. AMD released four Ryzen 7000 series CPUs on
                          September 27, 2022. As it did with the previous Ryzen 5000 chips, the company plans to release the
                          higher-end (i.e. more expensive) CPUs first and then follow up with more budget processors later
                          this year. Prices for the initial crop of CPUs ranges from $299 to $699. Here's everything you need
                          to know about the new AMD Ryzen 7000 processors. AMD’s Ryzen 7000 series processors will launch on
                          September 27, 2022. The line will consist of four CPUs.

Question 101              : What is the new price of Tesla's Full-Self Driving (FSD) software?

                          much more. Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO. Tesla’s increasing the price of its
                          Full-Self Driving (FSD) software to $15,000. In a post on Twitter, Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced
                          that the new price will go into effect in North America starting September 5th, representing a
                          $3,000 jump. Drivers who order a vehicle before September 5th won’t have to pay the newly-increased
                          price, Musk says. The price hike comes as Tesla begins rolling out FSD beta 10.69 to drivers, a
                          version Musk calls “a big step forward.” It’s still unclear whether Tesla plans on raising the
                          price of its FSD subscription, which currently costs $199 per month. The FSD software lets drivers
                          use Tesla’s advanced driving assistance system (ADAS), Autopilot, to navigate to and from specific
                          destinations, among other driver-assist features. FSD doesn’t make a vehicle fully autonomous; it
                          requires drivers to keep their hands on the wheel and pay attention to the road at all times. The
                          price of Tesla’s FSD beta has slowly crept up over the years, and cost $5,000 upon launch.

                          House of the Dragon premieres Aug. 21 on HBO. It’s been three years since Game Of Thrones ended,
                          and five years since its fandom started complaining bitterly about its final seasons. Spin-off
                          House Of The Dragon therefore debuts to less hype than it might have once had, but really could
                          restore our fascination with Westeros. Immediately, its premiere boasts everything that Thrones did
                          well: an overqualified cast of character actors; backstabbing; sexposition; and lots of dragons.
                          The first proposed spin-off to Game Of Thrones – a Naomi Watts-led adventure set in Westeros’
                          distant past – was ultimately scrapped, reportedly because it was too different from the original
                          show. Perhaps as a result, it sometimes feels like there’s an element of overcorrection here. It’s
                          beautifully rendered - the budget is clearly late-season Game Of Thrones rather than Season 1, and
                          both the Cornish and Spanish locations and the computer-generated dragon flights look magical - but
                          looks and sounds awfully close to its progenitor, down to iconography and locations. That’s not
                          necessarily a bad thing when it comes to the storytelling, since it’s set just far enough in
                          Westeros’ past to keep us guessing, but it speaks of a pervasive timidity in Hollywood to take even
                          the most minor of risks. Still, that’s admittedly more a criticism of this show’s context than its

                          back in 2016, but luckily the PlayStation VR2 is now here to take the best console VR to the next
                          level. With the PS5 now out worldwide, it’s no surprise that fans have been waiting for a PS VR2
                          headset to go with the new home console. Now we have it – but be warned, it costs more than a PS5
                          itself. If that’s too steep for you, the existing PSVR headset still works with the PlayStation 5,
                          though owners have to request a free adapter to connect the camera to the system. The PS VR2
                          launched worldwide on 22 February 2023, with more than 40 games releasing alongside it in the first
                          month or so. This is the bad news: PS VR2 is expensive. The basic bundle – which includes the
                          headset, a pair of controllers, and stereo headphones – costs $549/£529/€599, which is more than
                          the first PS VR headset launched for, and even more than it costs to buy the PS5 now, which is
                          $499/£479/€549. That’s the cheapest way to buy the new VR headset.

                          affect our editorial independence. It’s been six long years since Sony release the PlayStation VR
                          back in 2016, but luckily the PlayStation VR2 is now here to take the best console VR to the next
                          level. With the PS5 now out worldwide, it’s no surprise that fans have been waiting for a PS VR2
                          headset to go with the new home console. Now we have it – but be warned, it costs more than a PS5
                          itself. If that’s too steep for you, the existing PSVR headset still works with the PlayStation 5,
                          though owners have to request a free adapter to connect the camera to the system. The PS VR2
                          launched worldwide on 22 February 2023, with more than 40 games releasing alongside it in the first
                          month or so. This is the bad news: PS VR2 is expensive. The basic bundle – which includes the
                          headset, a pair of controllers, and stereo headphones – costs $549/£529/€599, which is more than
                          the first PS VR headset launched for, and even more than it costs to buy the PS5 now, which is
                          $499/£479/€549. That’s the cheapest way to buy the new VR headset.

                          TECH CHECK: McCarley said the idea of using technology to broaden the sport has been the focus of
                          conversations he’s had with Woods and McIlroy over the years, as he and Woods's agent, Mark
                          Steinberg, "have spent hours together over the years talking about how good primetime golf is but
                          how difficult and expensive it is to execute." McCarley: “But the proof is in the ratings every few
                          years when a West Coast event can go late into East Coast prime.” Those conversations became more
                          frequent during the pandemic, particularly with Rob McNamara, EVP of TGR Ventures, which includes
                          PopStroke, Full Swing Golf and TGR Design. Separately, McCarley was having similar conversations
                          with McIlroy and his team. NBC launched GolfPass with McIlroy in 2019, two years before McCarley
                          left the network. “It evolved into how we can harness technology to enhance the experience for both
                          participants who play and for fans,” McCarley said. “We believe there is a difference between
                          following and watching -- so shorter-form experiences are going to be more important as we continue
                          to be crunched for time.” MARKETPLACE OF IDEAS: McCarley bounced the idea off his mentor, Ebersol,
                          who immediately bought into the idea and helped McCarley refine the concept.

                          the fastest-growing trucking fleets in the western United States, is getting even more SUPER. The

                          offensive weapons that can thrive in this system. More importantly, Williams will be in his third
                          season with Lincoln Riley. Plus, USC’s defense is going to require a lot of shootouts in 2023.

                          USC Trojans quarterback Caleb Williams is the reigning Heisman Trophy winner after a breakout
                          season in 2022. Now, we can look ahead to the candidates who will join the growing list of Heisman
                          winners. Stay tuned for the upcoming year as we evaluate the leading Heisman candidates, track
                          performances and so much more. Once the college football season begins, we’ll provide weekly

                          2023. We’ll provide individual breakdowns for each of the players this off-season. Caleb Williams
                          is the favorite to win the 2023 Heisman Trophy, to the surprise of no one. While history suggests
                          it will be another player hosting the coveted trophy at the Heisman ceremony next December,
                          Williams is in a great position to repeat. While USC loses Jordan Addison, it welcomes new
                          offensive weapons that can thrive in this system. More importantly, Williams will be in his third
                          season with Lincoln Riley. Plus, USC’s defense is going to require a lot of shootouts in 2023.

                          [Warning: The following contains MAJOR spoilers for The Amazing Race Season 34 premiere, “Many
                          Firsts But Don’t Be Last.”] When you’re 30+ seasons into a show, you’ve got to change things up
                          from time to time. A big new change was revealed in The Amazing Race Season 34 premiere on
                          September 21 on CBS, and it raises the stakes of the fast-paced competition series to new heights.
                          In The Amazing Race Season 34, there will be no non-elimination rounds. If you’re last, you’re cut,
                          and you can’t be saved. The show announced this change ahead of the season premiere, but the
                          contestants had no clue. The paired players learned of this shocking update from host Phil Keoghan
                          outside of Nymphenburg Palace in Munich, Germany, marking another first — the series has always
                          started the seasons somewhere in the United States. Throughout their adventures, the cast will trek
                          through Jordan, Austria, Italy, France, Spain, and Iceland before arriving at the Nashville finish
                          line. Players hardly had any time to process the non-elimination bombshell before it was off to the
                          (many) races. The first leg of the race required players to drive themselves to three different
                          places before finding Phil at the first Pit Stop. This task went off relatively without a hitch for
                          the teams. The next challenge was more physically demanding, requiring contestants to roll a beer
                          keg (when in Germany) through obstacles in one minute.

                          They couldn’t move forward until they successfully got through all the obstacles in that short
                          timeframe. Military brothers Michael and Marcus made quick work of that, nailing it on the second
                          attempt, but others struggled more. Timing is everything in this game, so multiple failed challenge
                          attempts could snowball into eliminations. Up next, the pairs had to saw a log to unlock a clue.
                          The teams deployed different strategies for this. Where some exerted a lot of physical energy,
                          others took a less intense, more careful approach of letting the saw do what it’s made to do.
                          Preserving energy was a good move, as the last challenge required players to chisel through a large
                          block of ice. Kit Karzen/CBS Big Brother alums Derek and Claire (who have been dating since meeting
                          on the show) were the first couple to unlock all three clues, which reveal the next Pit Stop
                          location: Friedensengal, Munich’s Angel of Peace monument. Derek and Claire came in first place,
                          winning them $2,500 each. Newlyweds Glenda and Lumumba placed second, and former Rams cheerleaders
                          Quinton and Mattie placed third. Engaged couple Aastha and Nina came in last, making them the first
                          pair eliminated from The Amazing Race Season 34. The Amazing Race will have a 90-minute episode on
                          September 28, starting at 9:30/8:30c on CBS.

                          Barcelona also faces a ban that could stretch to multiple years if a match-fixing allegation
                          emerges in the so-called “Caso Negreira” case. Any club suspected of fixing just one game since a
                          UEFA rule took effect in 2007 is typically removed from the next European competition. A
                          disciplinary case also is opened that can apply further sanctions. Turkish club Fenerbahce ended up
                          missing three seasons because of fixing allegations in 2011. Milan and Toulouse, owned by RedBird
                          Capital Partners, are not alone facing UEFA questions about multi-club owners having “decisive
                          influence” over two clubs. Brighton and Union Saint-Gilloise have close ties through owner Tony
                          Bloom and both are in the Europa League. Aston Villa’s owners, including Milwaukee Bucks co-owner
                          Wes Edens, have a near-50% stake in Vitória Guimarães of Portugal. Both are in the Europa
                          Conference League. Still, those clubs can point to a celebrated ruling in 2017 when Leipzig and
                          Salzburg were able to persuade UEFA — amid broad skepticism — that energy drinks giant Red Bull did
                          not control both clubs. Any club’s ban opens the door for others to be included. Fifth-place La
                          Liga team Villarreal can step up from the Europa to Champions League if Barcelona is out. A Spanish
                          reshuffle would likely see eighth-place Athletic Bilbao get into the Conference League.

                          Woods, the strongest brand name in golf, was added later as the third co-founder. “TGL is the next
                          evolution within professional golf, and I am committed to helping lead it into the future,” Woods

                          Woods, the strongest brand name in golf, was added later as the third co-founder. “TGL is the next
                          evolution within professional golf, and I am committed to helping lead it into the future,” Woods
                          said in the press release announcing TGL.

Question 110              : Who is the director of BioShock movie?
Correct Answers         :  
                          Francis Lawrence

                          Back in February, Netflix announced it was working with 2K and Take-Two Interactive for a
                          live-action movie based on the BioShock series. The project has taken an important step forward, as
                          it now has a writer and director on board. Michael Green (Logan, Blade Runner 2049 and American
                          Gods) is on script duties, while Francis Lawrence will be keeping the director's chair warm. Along
                          with I Am Legend, Lawrence has directed four of the five Hunger Games movies as well as some
                          episodes of the Apple TV+ series See. He's currently shooting The Hunger Games: The Ballad of
                          Songbirds and Snakes, so don't expect a trailer for the BioShock movie anytime soon. It appears as
                          though the film will in fact be an adaptation of the first game. Netflix's Tudum site explains a
                          few basics of the original BioShock and notes that Lawrence will presumably "strap into a Big Daddy
                          suit and get ready to brave the flooded corridors of Rapture soon enough." For the sake of clarity,
                          there's only one question truly worth asking: Netflix, would you kindly reveal more details about
                          the movie? BioShock — our live-action feature film adaptation of the renowned video game franchise
                          — will be directed by Francis Lawrence (I Am Legend, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, Slumberland)

                          say that BioShock has a "strange mash-up of genre," touching upon things like horror and sci-fi, as
                          well as how it's a period piece. "I think it can be really unique and really beautiful and really
                          entertaining" as a film, Lawrence said. A BioShock movie was planned many years ago from Pirates of
                          the Caribbean director Gore Verbinski, but its R rating proved to be an issue. Now that it's being
                          made for Netflix, Lawrence said there are "always discussions about rating and tone," but he is
                          feeling free to execute on his own vision. "I certainly have not felt stifled in any way, or sent
                          in any directions with Netflix," he said, adding that the key creative team can basically do "what
                          we want to do" with the movie. Additionally, Lawrence said he has been in contact with BioShock
                          rights owner Take-Two and original writer-director Ken Levine. As for a status update on how the
                          BioShock movie is progressing through development, Lawrence said Green is in the middle of writing
                          the movie. As such, there is a "real possibility" that Lawrence will make it next, but nothing is
                          certain yet.

                          Kong, a subsidiary of Tencent, have acquired new shares in Japanese studio FromSoftware by way of a
                          third party allotment. In a document shared by FromSoftare's parent company Kadokawa Corporation,
                          as spotted by VGC, Sixjoy has bought 16.25% of shares in the Dark Souls developer, while Sony has
                          taken a 14.09% stake. Kadokawa will retain the remaining 69.66% of shares. In the notice, the firm
                          stated it "recognises the enhancement of capabilities for the creation, development and deployment
                          of game IP as one of the Group's highest priorities." "Through the implementation of the fund
                          procurement, FromSoftware will aim to proactively invest in development of more powerful game IP
                          for itself to strengthen FromSoftware's development capabilities and will seek to establish a

                          global market," the notice continued. The company added that it chose to allocate shares to Tencent
                          because of its efforts to promote "media mix strategy targeting the Chinese market," and
                          highlighted the firm's "capabilities to develop and deploy mobile games and other network
                          technologies," which it hopes to levy to increase FromSoftware's user base.

                          NEW YORK -- Serena Williams gave an emotional speech after what was likely her final tennis match
                          Friday night, an over-three-hour 7-5, 6-7 (4), 6-1 loss to Ajla Tomljanovic in the third round of
                          the US Open. "Thank you daddy, I know you're watching. Thanks mom," Williams said before starting
                          to cry during her postmatch on-court interview with ESPN's Mary Joe Fernandez. "Everyone that's
                          here, that's been on my side, for so many years, decades ... "These are happy tears, I guess. I

                          in a Vogue essay posted during the Canadian Open last month, citing her desire to have another
                          child. In the piece, she said she preferred the word "evolution" instead of "retirement" and
                          acknowledged how difficult it was to come to the decision. During her news conference after the
                          match, Williams told reporters she was excited about spending more time with her daughter, and
                          "explore a different version of Serena." However, she didn't completely close the door on a future
                          comeback.

                          TikTok star Tanya Pardazi was mourned at a funeral and on social media this week following her
                          death from a horrific accident. The 21-year-old Canadian influencer, also a University of Toronto
                          philosophy student, died on Aug. 27 from injuries suffered from a skydiving jump, during which her
                          parachute deployed too late. She was laid to rest at a memorial service in Richmond Hill, Ontario
                          on Sept. 2. "What Tanya did during 21 years, I think many people fail to fulfill even in 80 or 90
                          years," one of the guests said in a eulogy delivered at the funeral, which was streamed online by
                          the Elgin Mills Funeral Centre, according to The National Post, which was unable to identify the
                          speaker. The newspaper reported that most of the participants wore white as they sat before a white
                          casket and watched a montage of photos from Pardazi's life as Sarah McLachlan's "Angel" played in
                          the background. Another speaker later read off a list of 18 things that the TikTok star said she
                          had learned by her 18th birthday, such as, "Don't take yourself so seriously, nothing matters in
                          the grand scheme anyway." Pardazi fell to her death while completing her first solo dive with
                          Skydive Toronto, her childhood friend Melody Ozgoli told CTV News Toronto on Aug. 31.

                          The FAANG stocks (i.e. Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google) have had a great run as the
                          large cap digital giant leaders. However, with Facebook and Netflix facing massive declines in year
                          over year subscriber growth, their valuations have taken a hit along with the macro conditions of
                          rising interest rates and global instability. MATANA means gift in Hebrew and the shift to quality
                          stocks is important. Investors seek digital giants who show double digital year over year growth
                          and increasing revenue per user (ARPU). This collection of stocks are the gifts that keep giving.
                          Microsoft, Apple, Tesla, Alphabet, Nvidia, and Amazon (MATANA) are the large cap shocks who have
                          exhibited this consistency in year over year financial performance and market domination. Not all
                          tech stocks are created the same. Rising interest rates, a tightening Fed, Russia/Ukraine, and
                          global regulatory onslaughts on tech giants provide massive headwinds on tech. However, the digital
                          giants will still outperform most sectors given the macro environment. This shift to quality
                          requires an understanding of which big tech categories will survive the current big tech winter.
                          The winners will exhibit five traits as mentioned in my latest book, Everybody Wants To Rule The
                          World. What's your view of the digital giants? Have you gone through your cyclical rotation from
                          growth to value? Do you regret it? Ready to wait out for the dip or are you selling the rip?

                          The FAANG stocks (i.e. Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google) have had a great run as the
                          large cap digital giant leaders. However, with Facebook and Netflix facing massive declines in year
                          over year subscriber growth, their valuations have taken a hit along with the macro conditions of
                          rising interest rates and global instability. MATANA means gift in Hebrew and the shift to quality
                          stocks is important. Investors seek digital giants who show double digital year over year growth
                          and increasing revenue per user (ARPU). This collection of stocks are the gifts that keep giving.
                          Microsoft, Apple, Tesla, Alphabet, Nvidia, and Amazon (MATANA) are the large cap shocks who have
                          exhibited this consistency in year over year financial performance and market domination. Not all
                          tech stocks are created the same. Rising interest rates, a tightening Fed, Russia/Ukraine, and
                          global regulatory onslaughts on tech giants provide massive headwinds on tech. However, the digital
                          giants will still outperform most sectors given the macro environment. This shift to quality
                          requires an understanding of which big tech categories will survive the current big tech winter.
                          The winners will exhibit five traits as mentioned in my latest book, Everybody Wants To Rule The
                          World. What's your view of the digital giants? Have you gone through your cyclical rotation from
                          growth to value? Do you regret it? Ready to wait out for the dip or are you selling the rip?

Question 126              : Which animated series won the Emmy Award for Best Animated Program?

                          Netflix's League of Legends-based animated series Arcane has won an Emmy for Outstanding Animated
                          Program, becoming the first streaming series to win in that category. It beat out some much better
                          known competition, including Bob's Burgers, Rick and Morty, The Simpsons and What If...? hosted by
                          the late Chadwick Boseman. "It’s a big deal for us as we come from video games. It’s been amazing
                          to see the world embrace our characters and our stories," said Arcane co-creator Christian Linke.
                          The series stars Ella Purnell (Jinx), Hailee Steinfeld (Vi) and Katie Leung (Caitlyn). It was
                          picked up for a second season by Netflix last winter, suggesting that the streamer was willing to
                          embrace high-budget game-based productions. The first season boasted nearly 34.2 million viewing
                          hours in its first week on Netflix's top 10 chart, putting it second in views at that time. It also
                          received very positive reviews from both critics and audiences.

  - Answer              : Clone Wars
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          The show follows the adventures of the Jedi Knights as they fight against the Separatist forces and
                          the rise of the Sith. With its stunning animation, complex characters, and thrilling action
                          sequences, Clone Wars has become a fan favorite and a critical darling. What makes Clone Wars so
                          special is its ability to expand the Star Wars universe and provide new insights into familiar
                          characters. From exploring the motivations of the villainous Count Dooku to delving into the
                          relationship between Anakin Skywalker and his Padawan Ahsoka Tano, the show adds depth and
                          complexity to the Star Wars saga. The animation style is also a standout feature, with detailed
                          designs for each character and breathtaking visuals that make the action sequences come to life.
                          With its rich storytelling and stunning animation, it's no surprise that Clone Wars has won
                          multiple Emmys and continues to be a beloved part of the Star Wars canon. Garfield specials have
                          been a staple of television for decades, entertaining audiences with the lovable lasagna-loving cat
                          and his trusty sidekick, Odie. The specials, based on the comic strip, follow Garfield's antics, as
                          he lazes around the house and interacts with his owner, Jon Arbuckle, and the other residents of
                          their neighborhood. What sets Garfield apart is his sarcastic wit and larger-than-life personality
                          that audiences can't help but fall in love with. The animation style is simple, yet charming, and
                          the characters are brought to life with expressive and colorful designs.

                          lobbied FIFA to allow their team to open the tournament.[29][30] The final was played on 18
                          December 2022, National Day, at Lusail Stadium.[31][28] The matches for each group were allocated
                          to the following stadiums:[31] FIFA confirmed the group stage venue and kick-off times on 1 April
                          2022, following the draw.[32][33] On 11 August, it was confirmed that Qatar vs Ecuador had been
                          brought forward one day, now becoming the tournament's opening match, while Senegal vs Netherlands,
                          which would have opened the tournament under the original schedule, had been reallocated to the
                          freed-up timeslot.[34] In April 2022, FIFA announced the prizes for all participating nations. Each
                          qualified team received $1.5 million before the competition to cover preparation costs with each
                          team receiving at least $9 million in prize money. This edition's total prize pool was $440
                          million, $40 million greater than the prize pool of the previous tournament.[35] The tournament
                          featured new substitution rules whereby teams could make up to five substitutions in normal time,
                          and an additional substitution in extra time.[36][37][38] In addition, it was the first World Cup
                          to feature concussion substitutions, whereby each team was permitted to use a maximum of one
                          concussion substitute during a match.

                          England and was replaced by Hossein Hosseini. This was the first use of a dedicated concussion
                          substitute during a World Cup.[40] The bidding procedure to host the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups
                          began in January 2009. National associations had until 2 February 2009 to register interest.[41]
                          Initially, 11 bids were made for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, but Mexico withdrew from
                          proceedings,[42][43] and Indonesia's bid was rejected by FIFA in February 2010 after the Indonesian
                          Football Association failed to submit a letter of Indonesian government guarantee to support the
                          bid.[44] After UEFA were guaranteed to host the 2018 event, members of UEFA were no longer in
                          contention to host in 2022.[45] There were five bids remaining for the 2022 FIFA World Cup:
                          Australia, Japan, Qatar, South Korea, and the United States. The 22-member FIFA Executive Committee
                          convened in Zürich on 2 December 2010 to vote to select the hosts of both tournaments.[46] Two FIFA
                          executive committee members were suspended before the vote in relation to allegations of corruption
                          regarding their votes.

                          Nearly a dozen U.S. law enforcement agencies were searching for Francis on Tuesday. But officials
                          acknowledged he may already be in Mexico, and possibly on his way back to Asia. Four years ago,
                          U.S. District Court Judge Janis Sammartino feared Francis might run off when she turned down his
                          lawyer’s request to allow him to be under house arrest without round-the-clock security guards
                          watching the ailing defense contractor. At the time, Francis was cooperating with prosecutors as
                          they pursued charges against dozens of Navy officials who accepted bribes in exchange for
                          classified information that gave Francis’ ship servicing business in Asia an edge in getting
                          military contracts. When asked about the bold escape Tuesday, his lawyer, Devin Burstein, who
                          pushed for more leniency for his client, said: “At this time, I have no comment, sorry.” Sammartino
                          repeatedly maintained that Francis, who was in poor health and needed medical care, could only
                          remain under house arrest if private security guards were on site. At one point she expressed
                          concern that if he were to escape and ended up “back in Malaysia for whatever reason,” her name
                          would come up if anyone asked “who let somebody do this without any security,” according to a
                          transcript of a closed-door hearing in February 2018 that was unsealed in January. She raised
                          similar concerns in another hearing on Dec.

                          CEO Mark Zuckerberg will lay out the company's latest updates on the metaverse at the virtual
                          event. Meta Connect, the tech giant's annual virtual reality conference, will take place on Oct. 11
                          this year, the company said on Tuesday. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the event in a Facebook
                          post, saying simply "See you at Meta Connect on Oct 11." The site for the virtual event teases that
                          people will be able to "discover how the metaverse is being built by many and why collaboration is
                          the key to it all." Meta said it'll also offer a look at progress the company has made as well as
                          at what's to come in the near and far future. At last year's event, Zuckerberg revealed his
                          company's new name, Meta, a nod to its focus on building the metaverse. "This is the next chapter
                          of our work, and, we believe, for the internet overall," Zuckerberg said at the time. Zuckerberg
                          also teased Project Cambria, the company's next virtual reality headset, which is expected to be
                          more advanced and more expensive. In August, Zuckerberg said that the headset would come out in
                          October and that more details would be revealed at Connect. The virtual event will be livestreamed
                          on the Reality Labs Facebook page at 7 a.m. ET / 10 a.m. PT on Oct. 11.

Question 132              : How much is the fine that Meta is facing for failing to safeguard children's information on Instagram?

                          The company says it will appeal the fine from Ireland's Data Protection Commission. Meta faces a
                          hefty GDPR fine for its handling of children's data. Meta is facing a fine of 405 million euros, or
                          just over $400 million, from Ireland's Data Protection Commission for failing to safeguard
                          children's information on Instagram. The country's data watchdog had accused Instagram of setting
                          children's accounts to "public" by default and allowing children to operate business accounts on
                          the platform, which could leave their phone numbers and email addresses exposed. Full details of
                          the decision are expected to be published next week, a commission spokesman said Tuesday. Meta
                          confirmed the fine and said it plans to appeal the decision. "This inquiry focused on old settings
                          that we updated over a year ago, and we've since released many new features to help keep teens safe
                          and their information private," a Meta spokesperson told CNET via email on Tuesday. "Anyone under
                          18 automatically has their account set to private when they join Instagram, so only people they
                          know can see what they post, and adults can't message teens who don't follow them." The
                          spokesperson added that Meta disagrees with how the fine was calculated and is reviewing the rest
                          of the commission's decision. The $400 million fine would be the second-largest issued to a tech
                          company for a violation of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, behind Amazon's
                          record-setting $888 million fine in 2021.

                          Gotham Knights is a 2022 action role-playing game developed by WB Games Montréal and published by
                          Warner Bros. Games. Inspired by the Batman: Gotham Knights comic series and based on the DC Comics
                          character Batman and his supporting cast, the game focuses on the characters Nightwing, Batgirl,
                          Robin, and Red Hood as they attempt to restore justice to Gotham City during a period of decline in
                          the immediate aftermath of Batman's death. While investigating the events that led to their
                          mentor's demise, the heroes become embroiled in an ancient conflict between two secret
                          organizations fighting for control of Gotham: the Court of Owls and the League of Shadows. Gameplay
                          is presented from the third-person perspective with a primary focus on using each playable
                          character's traversal and combat abilities to defeat enemies and explore the environment. Players
                          can freely move around Gotham City, interacting with characters, undertaking missions, and gaining
                          experience points and other resources to level up their characters and equipment. Outside of the
                          story, players are able to complete side missions to unlock additional content and collectible
                          items. A cooperative online multiplayer mode is also included, allowing two players to play through
                          the single-player campaign together while progressing in their own game. Gotham Knights was
                          released on October 21, 2022, for PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series X/S. Versions for the
                          PlayStation 4 and Xbox One were also planned, but were ultimately cancelled.

                          the best broadcast journalist I could be. In all the years of preparing to become an anchor, one of
                          the things I strove for was to be able to control my emotions in the midst of hell breaking

                          RIP CNN anchor and icon Bernard Shaw, who died yesterday at age 82, per his family. Deepest
                          condolences to his family, friends, and former colleagues. May his memory be a blessing.
                          pic.twitter.com/3Xh27a0ucH In a 2014 interview with NPR, Shaw said that he decided to retire to
                          spend more time with his family. He said, “Gnawing at me for years were the untold sacrifices that
                          my wife, Linda — we’ve been married 40 years — and my daughter Anil and my son Amar made. I will
                          never know the sacrifices they made so that I could do what I did. The countless weeks away from
                          them, the missing of so many precious moments in a child’s and a wife’s lifetime, experiences. And
                          it began to gnaw at us more, more, more. And I decided it was time to walk off the field when I was
                          approaching my 61st birthday.” In a statement to CNN, Shaw’s family requested that in lieu of
                          flowers, donations be made to the Bernard Shaw Scholarship Fund at the University of Chicago.” Shaw
                          is survived by his wife, Linda, and children, Anil and Amar. ©2022 Cox Media Group © 2023 Cox Media

                          On 8 September 2022, at 15:10 BST, Elizabeth II, Queen of the United Kingdom and the other
                          Commonwealth realms, and the longest-reigning British monarch, died at Balmoral Castle in
                          Aberdeenshire, Scotland, at the age of 96. Her death was publicly announced at 18:30. She was
                          succeeded by her eldest son, Charles III. The death of Queen Elizabeth II set in motion Operation
                          London Bridge, a collection of plans including arrangements for her state funeral, and supported by
                          Operation Unicorn, which set protocols for her death occurring in Scotland. The United Kingdom
                          observed a national mourning period of 10 days. The Queen's lying in state took place in
                          Westminster Hall from 14 to 19 September, during which time an estimated 250,000 people queued to
                          pay their respects. Elizabeth's state funeral on 19 September was the first held in Britain since
                          Winston Churchill's in 1965. A funeral service was held at Westminster Abbey, followed by a
                          procession to Wellington Arch that featured around 3,000 military personnel and was watched by
                          around a million people in central London. The state hearse then transported the Queen's coffin to
                          Windsor, followed by another procession through Windsor Great Park and a committal service at St
                          George's Chapel at Windsor Castle.

                          of the United Kingdom was a longer reign than any other British monarch, has died at the age of 96.

                          Highlands, royal family officials announced. Her son Charles, 73, is now king and will be known as
                          King Charles III. Officials said he remains at Balmoral and will return to London on Friday. The

                          members of my family," the king said in a statement. "We mourn profoundly the passing of a
                          cherished Sovereign and a much-loved Mother. I know her loss will be deeply felt throughout the
                          country, the Realms and the Commonwealth, and by countless people around the world." Camilla, his

                          occasion — code-named Operation Golden Orb — was a display of heritage, tradition and spectacle
                          unmatched around the world. To the crowds gathered under rainy skies — thousands of whom had camped
                          overnight — it was a chance to be part of a historic event. Julie Newman, a 77-year-old visitor
                          from Canada, said the royal procession had been “absolutely fabulous. Couldn’t ask for anything
                          better.” “But we’re ready to go back home and watch it all on the television,” she added. But to
                          millions more, the day was greeted with a shrug, the awe and reverence the ceremony was designed to
                          evoke largely gone. And to a few, it was reason to protest. Hundreds who want to see Britain become
                          a republic gathered to holler “Not my king.” They see the monarchy as an institution that stands
                          for privilege and inequality, in a country of deepening poverty and fraying social ties. A handful
                          were arrested. WATCH: Pageantry and protests surround coronation of King Charles III As the day
                          began, the abbey buzzed with excitement and was abloom with fragrant flowers and colorful hats.

                          Because of the preparation needed, the Coronation is not likely to happen very soon after Charles's
                          accession - Queen Elizabeth succeeded to the throne in February 1952, but was not crowned until
                          June 1953. For the past 900 years the coronation has been held in Westminster Abbey - William the
                          Conqueror was the first monarch to be crowned there, and Charles will be the 40th. It is an
                          Anglican religious service, carried out by the Archbishop of Canterbury. At the climax of the
                          ceremony, he will place St Edward's Crown on Charles's head - a solid gold crown, dating from 1661.
                          This is the centrepiece of the Crown Jewels at the Tower of London, and is only worn by the monarch
                          at the moment of coronation itself (not least because it weighs a hefty 2.23kg - almost 5lbs).
                          Unlike royal weddings, the coronation is a state occasion - the government pays for it, and
                          ultimately decides the guest list. There will be music, readings and the ritual of anointing the
                          new monarch, using oils of orange, roses, cinnamon, musk and ambergris. The new King will take the
                          Coronation oath in front of the watching world. During this elaborate ceremony he will receive the
                          orb and sceptre as symbols of his new role and the Archbishop of Canterbury will place the solid
                          gold crown on his head.

                          Fox's latest musical drama brings viewers along for the radio in this tale about a fictional
                          country music empire. One of the most recognizable genres of music, country music has seen its fair
                          share of stars and dynasties throughout its years. Fox’s new musical drama Monarch is out to
                          capture the intrigue of the country music scene. The synopsis that Fox provides is tantalizing:
                          Reigning King of Country Music Albie Roman, along with his insanely talented -- and tough as nails
                          -- wife, Queen of Country Music Dottie Cantrell Roman, have created a country music dynasty, but
                          even though the Roman name is synonymous with authenticity, the very foundation of their success is
                          a lie. When their reign as country royalty is put in jeopardy, heir to the crown Nicolette “Nicky”
                          Roman will stop at nothing to protect her family’s legacy, while ensuring her own quest for
                          stardom, alongside her brother Luke and sister Gigi. The trailer very much confirms the synopsis.
                          With characters oozing secrets, betrayals, fistfights, guns, bright lights, and country music,
                          there’s enough content here for a whole album’s worth of country music lyrics. Importantly, we are
                          introduced to the major players in the series, most of them members of the Roman family. Created by
                          Melissa London Hilfers, the series promises an epic drama with familiar actors and names from the
                          country music scene including starring roles from Susan Sarandon and country singer Trace Adkins.

                          afraid to speak her mind. Outside of the business world, however, Kayla’s relationships
                          are...complicated. Holder has appeared in Magnum P.I., UnReal, Make It or Break It, Ringer, and
                          Born Again Virgin. Pascual will portray Ace Grayson, Nicolette's adoptive teenage son. He's also a
                          talented singer and dreams of becoming a country star like his grandpa. Pascual, who is originally
                          from the Philippines, was a successful musician in his native country before making his way to
                          America. He most recently made a cameo in Netflix’s Jo Koy: In His Elements. Croasdell will star as
                          Nicolette's husband, Clive Grayson, a struggling British actor. Croasdell can be seen in the
                          British shows Peak Practice, The Chase, EastEnders, and Agatha Christie’s Poirot. Higareda plays
                          Catt Phoenix, a mother who loathes the Roman family. She especially dislikes Nicolette, which
                          creates tense situations when Catt moves to their town.

                          Fox's latest musical drama brings viewers along for the radio in this tale about a fictional
                          country music empire. One of the most recognizable genres of music, country music has seen its fair
                          share of stars and dynasties throughout its years. Fox’s new musical drama Monarch is out to
                          capture the intrigue of the country music scene. The synopsis that Fox provides is tantalizing:
                          Reigning King of Country Music Albie Roman, along with his insanely talented -- and tough as nails
                          -- wife, Queen of Country Music Dottie Cantrell Roman, have created a country music dynasty, but
                          even though the Roman name is synonymous with authenticity, the very foundation of their success is
                          a lie. When their reign as country royalty is put in jeopardy, heir to the crown Nicolette “Nicky”
                          Roman will stop at nothing to protect her family’s legacy, while ensuring her own quest for
                          stardom, alongside her brother Luke and sister Gigi. The trailer very much confirms the synopsis.
                          With characters oozing secrets, betrayals, fistfights, guns, bright lights, and country music,
                          there’s enough content here for a whole album’s worth of country music lyrics. Importantly, we are
                          introduced to the major players in the series, most of them members of the Roman family. Created by
                          Melissa London Hilfers, the series promises an epic drama with familiar actors and names from the
                          country music scene including starring roles from Susan Sarandon and country singer Trace Adkins.

                          hadn’t used the Plus name since 2017, but it resurrected it in 2022 with the iPhone 14 Plus. Just
                          like before, the new model increases the screen size of the standard one, but keeps the majority of
                          the other technical features in place. It fits in that awkward space between the cheaper iPhone 14
                          and the slightly more expensive, but superior Pro model. But is there any real reason to buy it?
                          The iPhone 14 Plus is wider, taller, and heavier than the iPhone 14, and the only dimension that
                          stays the same is the thickness at 7.8mm. Made from aluminum and glass, it’s a step down in luxury
                          from the stainless steel and glass Pro models, but with this comes the advantage of low weight. At
                          203 grams, the iPhone 14 Plus can’t be called light, but it’s lighter than the iPhone 14 Pro and
                          only a few grams heavier than the Samsung Galaxy S22+. My usual iPhone of choice is the iPhone 14
                          Pro, and I’ve been consistently surprised at how light the iPhone 14 Plus feels when I pick it up,
                          despite the larger screen and body, as well as the scant 3-gram real-world difference between them.

                          We are thankful for all his contributions to our organization over the years. When you look at all
                          that he has accomplished already, it is truly remarkable, and we know someday we will be
                          celebrating his Hall of Fame induction. “We also know he still has many more achievements in our
                          sport ahead of him including competing for the championship this season. We wish Kyle, Samantha,
                          Brexton, and Lennix the very best.” Harvick said in late July that wherever Busch went, he would
                          make an impact. “I know there’s a lot of things that go on around Kyle, but in the end Kyle is
                          still one of the best that’s ever come through this garage,” Harvick said. “There’s a lot of teams
                          that can say that they’ve never had one of those types of drivers. He literally could rebuild an
                          organization if somebody took a chance that hasn’t had one of those types of drivers.” Busch

                          last-lap crash in the 2001 Daytona 500. “We’d like to welcome Kyle back to Team Chevy, where he
                          started his NASCAR career,” said Jim Campbell, Chevrolet U.S. Vice President, Performance and
                          Motorsports, in a statement. “As a 60 Cup race winner and two-time champion, he will be a valuable
                          addition to Richard Childress Racing and the Chevrolet line-up.

Question 144              : What is men's year-end No 1 in tennis in 2022?
Correct Answers         :

                          ATP Chairman Andrea Gaudenzi presents Carlos Alcaraz with the year-end ATP No. 1 Trophy presented
                          by Pepperstone at the Nitto ATP Finals in November. The ATP today published the 2022 year-end
                          Pepperstone ATP Rankings on ATPTour.com with Spaniards Carlos Alcaraz and Rafael Nadal headlining a
                          season of record-breaking performances and milestones. Alcaraz and Nadal are the first countrymen
                          to finish No. 1 and 2 since Americans Pete Sampras and Michael Chang in 1996. Alcaraz, 19, is the

                          ATP Rankings, while Nadal, 36, is the oldest to finish in the Top 2. Nadal also finishes in the Top

                          overall with 18. Alcaraz is the first player other than Nadal, Federer, Novak Djokovic and Andy
                          Murray to finish No. 1 since Andy Roddick in 2003. He also makes the biggest jump to year-end No. 1
                          in history, rising from No. 32 at the end of 2021. Alcaraz and No.

                          7, but that’s all because of Wimbledon. He’s playing like the No. 1 player in the world. It’s not
                          apples to apples like other years.” Under the normal points system, Djokovic might not even qualify
                          for the ATP Finals in Turin, Italy, this year. Heading into Paris, he was in 10th place in the
                          points race. But under the ATP’s Grand Slam champion rule, any player who wins a major title and is
                          ranked within the top 20 is guaranteed a spot in the year-end championship. (The WTA Tour has no
                          such rule, which is why Djokovic’s fellow Wimbledon champion, Elena Rybakina, did not qualify for
                          the WTA Finals in Fort Worth.) “Most of the upheaval this year is because of Djokovic,” Patrick
                          McEnroe, a former United States Davis Cup captain and now an ESPN commentator said. “He missed two
                          majors and didn’t get points for the one he won. It really affected the rest of the field. You
                          could make the case that if Djokovic runs the table, wins Paris and the ATP Finals, that he
                          deserves to be No. 1.” The player most likely to end 2022 at No. 1 is Alcaraz. So far he has won
                          five tournaments this year, including ATP Masters 1000s in Miami and Madrid. In Madrid, he beat
                          Nadal, Djokovic and Alexander Zverev in succession.

                          in a drama. The South Korean won for playing the main role of the increasingly desperate Seong
                          Gi-hun in the hit Netflix show. The show's creator, Hwang Dong-hyuk, won the best drama series
                          director prize, also the first Asian to do so. Ted Lasso won best comedy series for the second year

                          Charles." "Keep it royalist, keep it royalist," the show's star Brian Cox, who was also on stage,
                          told him after the audience went fairly quiet. Armstrong then added: "I'm not saying that we're any
                          more legitimate in our position than he is. We'll leave that to other people." Another Succession
                          cast member, Matthew Macfadyen, won best supporting drama actor for his portrayal of ambitious
                          interloper Tom Wambsgans, which he said was a "bonkers gift of a role".

Question 148              : How much did Google acquire Mandiant for?

  - Source              :
                          Google (GOOG, GOOGL) is finally sounding off on its blockbuster $5.4 billion acquisition of
                          cybersecurity firm Mandiant, expressing the extent of the company's ambitions in the sector. The
                          mega-deal was all about strengthening Google's capabilities in detecting cyber threats – something
                          Mandiant has become well-known for, said Google Cloud Chief Information Security Officer Phil
                          Venables at a press conference yesterday. “I want to emphasize that this is adding more frontline
                          threat intelligence,” Venables said. “When you look at what we’ve got existing at Google, which
                          includes very complementary things from VirusTotal and our other threat intelligence capabilities,
                          bringing that together really gives us this kind of end-to-end security operations stack. Again,
                          Google Cloud is already strong when we think about how we analyze data and put it in context, and
                          that only gets stronger with Mandiant.” Venables was very clear that Google Cloud's ambitions in
                          cybersecurity are massive, but on some level, the size of the deal already said it all. The
                          acquisition is Google's second-largest ever, surpassed only by the company's $12.5 billion buyout
                          of Motorola ten years ago. The more than $5 billion the company spent on Mandiant overshadows even
                          what Google shelled out for Fitbit, which it bought for $2.1 billion. The timing of this deal also
                          wasn't an accident – it's a response to a changing environment.

                          Mandiant will join Google's cloud computing division, which is yet to grow to the same size as
                          Microsoft Azure or Amazon Web Services. "Organizations around the world are facing unprecedented
                          cybersecurity challenges as the sophistication and severity of attacks that were previously used to
                          target major governments are now being used to target companies in every industry," said Thomas
                          Kurian, CEO of Google Cloud, in a statement. He added: "We look forward to welcoming Mandiant to
                          Google Cloud to further enhance our security operations suite and advisory services, and help
                          customers address their most important security challenges." The deal is expected to close later
                          this year. Shares of Mandiant closed up 16% on Monday after The Information reported that Google
                          was interested in acquiring the company. Mandiant, which has a market value around $5.25 billion,
                          was previously under the FireEye umbrella before that brand was sold. FireEye was credited with
                          helping Microsoft discover the SolarWinds hack that attacked government systems in 2019 and 2020.
                          Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to investors Tuesday, "With cyber attacks increasing by the
                          day and cyber warfare underway from Russia/state sponsored cyber terrorism organizations, Google is
                          doubling down on its cyber security footprint at the right time with Mandiant and looking to
                          differentiate itself from the likes of behemoths Microsoft and Amazon in the cloud arms race.

                          Tuesday, Sept. 13, 2022 Gayle King, the award-winning co-host of “CBS Mornings,” has been chosen to
                          receive the 39th Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Journalism, Arizona State University
                          officials announced today. King, who is also editor-at-large of Oprah Daily and hosts a live,
                          weekly radio show titled “Gayle King in the House” on SiriusXM, will be honored during a ceremony
                          in Phoenix on Feb. 21, 2023, at the Sheraton Phoenix Downtown. The Cronkite Award — named after the
                          late CBS News anchor — has honored prominent journalists since 1984. The award recognizes the
                          recipients’ accomplishments and leadership over the course of their careers. Registration is now
                          open for the Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Journalism luncheon. “Gayle King’s career and
                          accomplishments are remarkable, and her professionalism embodies everything that Walter Cronkite
                          valued in journalism,” said Cronkite School Dean Battinto L. Batts Jr. “Her approach to covering
                          important events and interviewing politicians, leaders and celebrities is unparalleled. It’s an
                          honor to present Gayle with this prestigious award.” “I am honored to accept the Walter Cronkite
                          Award for Excellence in Journalism. The work myself and other journalists do is important, but I
                          don’t do it alone.

                          Critics praised its open-ended gameplay, open-world design, and attention to detail, though some
                          criticized its technical performance. It is the best-selling Zelda game and one of the best-selling
                          video games of all time, with 32.35 million copies sold by 2023. Breath of the Wild is considered
                          one of the greatest video games of all time. Journalists described it as a landmark in open-world
                          design for its emphasis on experimentation, physics-based sandbox, and emergent gameplay. Numerous
                          developers cited Breath of the Wild as inspiration, and it is a popular point of comparison among
                          open-world games. A spin-off, Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity, was released in 2020 while a
                          sequel, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, was released in 2023. Breath of the Wild is an
                          open world action-adventure game. Players are tasked with exploring the kingdom of Hyrule while
                          controlling Link. Breath of the Wild encourages nonlinear gameplay, which is illustrated by the
                          game's lack of defined entrances or exits to areas,[1] scant instruction given to the player, and
                          encouragement to explore freely.[2] Breath of the Wild introduces a consistent physics engine to
                          the Zelda series, letting players approach problems in different ways rather than trying to find a
                          single solution.[3] The game also integrates a "chemistry engine" that defines the physical
                          properties of most objects and governs how they interact with the player and one another.

                          Nintendo has guarded the new Breath of the Wild game so tightly that players do not even know the
                          title of the new Legend of Zelda. Fans have called the Nintendo game The Legend of Zelda: Breath of
                          the Wild 2, BOTW 2, and the Sequel to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. However, according
                          to a new rumor, the Breath of the Wild 2 name may finally have leaked online. While “new details”
                          about the Zelda game come and go, the newest rumor might hold more water than the others. While the
                          alleged title is still a rumor, the next adventure of Link and Zelda is “The Legend of Zelda:
                          Breath of Duality.” According to Nintendo Life, the report comes from veteran video game journalist
                          Paul Gale “who runs his own website, appeared in Nintendo Power, and worked with many other video
                          game outlets over the years,” according to Nintendo Life. In a post, Gale reports that “the sequel
                          to BotW and its main hook is right in the name, which establishes on the ‘Breath’ familiarity from
                          the 2017 hit and [gives] a nod to the fact that you can play as more than the aforementioned
                          title’s Link (including various, polar themes), hence ‘Duality.’” RUMOR: A potential Breath of the

                          “The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom” is perhaps the most highly anticipated video game of
                          the year. (In fact, it won that very award in 2022 – the wait has been long.) And by all accounts,
                          it’s living up to the hype: “Tears of the Kingdom,” released May 12, has already broken sales
                          records, earned raves from experts like IGN and longtime “Zelda” fans, and driven some fans to take
                          time off from work to dive into its intricate, enveloping world. The very first “Zelda” game was
                          released in 1986, and almost 40 years later, Link’s adventures are still enchanting gamers and
                          infuriating those who don’t have over 100 hours to spend discovering the game’s many hidden
                          treasures. Here’s what you need to know about the newest installment in the “Zelda” franchise, sans
                          spoilers. Link, now a knight of the kingdom of Hyrule, just got done saving Hyrule in 2017’s
                          acclaimed game, “Breath of the Wild.” But just when he thought he could hand up his green tunic,
                          super-villain Ganondorf returns to wreak havoc, taking the wise Princess Zelda with him. Link sets
                          out to find her – and to once again save Hyrule from one of its most prevalent threats. But oh!

                          Hocus Pocus 2 is only weeks away and we've been given a spooky treat of a new trailer for the
                          eagerly-awaited sequel. The second trailer was debuted at the D23 Expo and it gave us our first
                          look at Hannah Waddingham's role as The Witch, as well as the return of Doug Jones as "good zombie"
                          Billy Butcherson. Disney released the first trailer for the highly-anticipated sequel in late June
                          and if you weren't aware of the demand for the movie, the trailer notched up more than 40 million
                          views in its first 24 hours. The sequel sees the Sanderson Sisters return to wreak havoc in Salem
                          once again, but what else can we expect? Here's everything you need to know about Hocus Pocus 2. As
                          mentioned above, the first trailer for Hocus Pocus 2 arrived on June 28, 2022 and while it was low
                          on plot, it was high on spookiness. The trailer teased the return of the Sanderson Sisters and
                          featured other classic Hocus Pocus items such as the Black Flame Candle. Disney then revealed the
                          second trailer for Hocus Pocus 2 on September 9, 2022 and it was more plot-focused than the teaser.

                          For the "tracked" festivals, I'm only looking at major & large multi-day, multigenre festivals that
                          are produced by C3 and/or have a history of overlap with ACL. These festivals, as of now, are
                          Coachella, Bonnaroo, Lolla Chicago, Shaky Knees, BottleRock, Jazz Fest, Boston Calling, Gov Ball,
                          Lolla international events, Innings, Okeechobee, Osheaga & Hangout. Also, to keep the list from not
                          being stupid long, I'll only list an act if they're playing at least 2 tracked festivals. I will
                          use my discretion to determine the validity of a source/rumor. Sorry in advance if you disagree.

                          will be evaluated according to how the tutorial contributes to topics promoting diversity (e.g.,
                          working on minority languages, developing NLP for good), participation diversity (e.g.,
                          coordinating with social affinity groups, providing subsidies, making a promotional plan for the
                          tutorial), and representation diversity among tutorial presenters. For more information or advice,

                          Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP) invite proposals for tutorials to be held in

                          computational linguistics, broadly conceived to include related disciplines. ​ We invite proposals
                          for two types of tutorials: ​ Cutting-edge: tutorials that cover advances in newly emerging areas
                          not previously covered in any ACL/EMNLP/EACL/NAACL-HLT/AACL/COLING related tutorial (see the list
                          of tutorials in the past 4 years). Introductory: tutorials that provide introductions to related
                          fields that are potentially relevant for the computational linguistics community (e.g.,
                          linguistics, bioinformatics, machine learning techniques). In both cases, the aim of a tutorial is
                          primarily to help understand a scientific problem, its tractability, and its theoretical and
                          practical implications. Presentations of particular technological solutions or systems are welcome,
                          provided that they serve as illustrations of broader scientific considerations. ​ Tutorials will be

                          (AP) — The United Kingdom and the world bade farewell to Queen Elizabeth II on Monday with a state
                          funeral that drew presidents and kings, princes and prime ministers — and crowds in the streets of
                          London and at Windsor Castle — to honor a monarch whose 70-year reign defined an age. In a country
                          known for pomp and pageantry, the first state funeral since Winston Churchill’s was filled with
                          spectacle: Before the service, a bell tolled 96 times — once a minute for each year of Elizabeth’s
                          life. Then, 142 Royal Navy sailors used ropes to draw the gun carriage carrying her flag-draped
                          coffin to Westminster Abbey, where pallbearers carried it inside and about 2,000 people ranging
                          from world leaders to health care workers gathered to mourn. The trappings of state and monarchy
                          abounded: The coffin was draped with the Royal Standard and atop it was the Imperial State Crown,
                          sparkling with almost 3,000 diamonds, and the sovereign’s orb and scepter. But the personal was
                          also present: The coffin was followed into the church by generations of Elizabeth’s descendants,
                          including King Charles III, heir to the throne Prince William and 9-year-old George, who is second
                          in line.

Question 165              : Who is Italy's first female prime minister?
Correct Answers         :  
                          Giorgia Meloni
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prediction (only positive):
  - Answer              : Giorgia Meloni
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          Populist firebrand Giorgia Meloni has been named as Italy’s first female prime minister, becoming
                          the country’s most far-right leader since Benito Mussolini. She received the mandate to form a
                          government from Italy’s President Sergio Mattarella on Friday afternoon after two days of official
                          consultations, and is set to be sworn in at 10 a.m. local time (4 a.m. ET) on Saturday. Last
                          month’s general election resulted in an alliance of far-right and center-right parties, led by her
                          ultraconservative Brothers of Italy, winning enough seats in Italy’s parliament to form a
                          government. Meloni announced her government picks in Rome’s Quirinal Palace, making the leader of
                          Italy’s far right League party, Matteo Salvini, infrastructure minister. Giancarlo Giorgetti, also
                          of the League party, was made economy minister. Antonio Tajani from the Forza Italia party was
                          given the position of minister of foreign affairs while the role of defense minister went to Guido
                          Crosetto, one of the founders of the Brothers of Italy party. The new government will be made up of
                          a coalition of Meloni’s Brothers of Italy party, Salvini’s League party and the Forza Italia party,
                          led by former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. The Brothers of Italy received nine
                          ministries whereas Forza Italia and the League each received five ministries.

                          On 25 October, Meloni gave her first official speech as Prime Minister in front of the Chamber of
                          Deputies, before the confidence vote on her cabinet.[132][133] During her speech, she stressed the
                          weight of being the first woman to serve as head of the Italian government.[134] She thanked
                          several Italian women including Tina Anselmi, Samantha Cristoforetti, Grazia Deledda, Oriana
                          Fallaci, Nilde Iotti, Rita Levi-Montalcini, and Maria Montessori, who she said, "with the boards of
                          their own examples, built the ladder that today allows me to climb and break the heavy glass
                          ceiling placed over our heads".[135][136] The government won the confidence vote with a comfortable
                          majority in both houses.[137][138] One of the first measures implemented by the government regarded
                          COVID-19 and concerned with the complete removal of the COVID-19 vaccination certificate, known in
                          Italy as the Green Pass; moreover, non-vaccinated doctors were re-integrated into service.[139] By
                          this time, the government’s workforce vaccination mandate had been in place for over one year,
                          rendering the edict largely symbolic. On 31 October, the government approved a decree providing for
                          a penalty of up to six years of imprisonment for illegal parties and rallies.

                          ultraconservative Brothers of Italy, winning enough seats in Italy’s parliament to form a
                          government. Meloni announced her government picks in Rome’s Quirinal Palace, making the leader of
                          Italy’s far right League party, Matteo Salvini, infrastructure minister. Giancarlo Giorgetti, also
                          of the League party, was made economy minister. Antonio Tajani from the Forza Italia party was
                          given the position of minister of foreign affairs while the role of defense minister went to Guido
                          Crosetto, one of the founders of the Brothers of Italy party. The new government will be made up of
                          a coalition of Meloni’s Brothers of Italy party, Salvini’s League party and the Forza Italia party,
                          led by former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. The Brothers of Italy received nine
                          ministries whereas Forza Italia and the League each received five ministries.

                          the first time ever, the Las Vegas Aces are WNBA champions. On Sunday afternoon, the Aces hung on
                          for a dramatic 78-71 win over the Connecticut Sun in Game 4 of the 2022 Finals to take the series
                          3-1. In addition to this being the franchise's first title, it is also the first major professional
                          title for a team in Las Vegas. The first half was a rugged, forgettable affair in which each team
                          had a scoreless streak that lasted over five minutes. Thankfully, both teams settled down and found
                          a rhythm in the second half to create a much more enjoyable experience. The game going down to the
                          wire helped in that department as well. Late in the fourth quarter, the Aces opened up a six-point
                          lead and appeared to be on the verge of pulling away. Instead, the Sun converted a five-point
                          possession after Kelsey Plum's reckless closeout on DeWanna Bonner's 3-point attempt was upgraded
                          to a flagrant foul. That swing allowed the Sun to jump right back into the game, and they briefly
                          grabbed the lead with 2:22 remaining on a Courtney Williams jumper. From that point on, though, it
                          was all Aces and all Riquna Williams.

Question 169              : What is the release date of the Pixel Watch?

                          This makes the Pixel Watch a bit more affordable than the Apple Watch Series 8 ($399) but pricier
                          than the Galaxy Watch 5 ($279) and recently-released Fitbit Sense 2 ($299). (See the rest of the
                          differences between the Google Pixel Watch vs. Fitbit Sense 2.) The Pixel Watch release date was
                          October 13, 2022, and since then we're continuing to track the best Pixel Watch deals. Note that
                          the Pixel Watch launched alongside the Google Pixel 7 and Google Pixel 7 Pro, which would both make
                          ideal companion devices for the company's smartwatch. The Google Pixel Watch is a simple-looking
                          smartwatch, I might even call it minimalistic. It comes in just one size: 41mm. Those with larger
                          wrists might complain about the lack of a larger option; that said, it fit me perfectly. The face
                          features a rounded design with a 3D glass dome. This raised effect distracts from the display's
                          thick bezel, but doesn't change the fact that a good chunk of the display is unusable. Perhaps my
                          prior experience with Samsung watches is to blame? I can't help but think it's a missed opportunity
                          to incorporate in digital rotating bezel in that space. It seems like no mistake that the Pixel
                          Watch is a "dark mode" device. The interface and all of Google's watch faces have black backgrounds
                          to further conceal the bezel.

                          Here’s how it works Home / Features / Google Pixel Watch 2: the features we want from a smartwatch
                          successor The first Pixel Watch was a solid start - but there's room for improvement Android fans
                          had a lot to like about the Google Pixel Watch when it landed in October 2022: a minimal design,
                          slick Fitbit integration, and the best version of the firm’s Wear OS software to date. Google’s
                          first wearable effort wasn’t perfect, though. Battery life was a real downer, and the “one size
                          fits all” approach was off-kilter with the rest of the smartwatch world. That leaves plenty of
                          areas for a Pixel Watch 2 to improve upon. At the time of writing there’s still a fairly long wait
                          before a successor is set to turn up – but that doesn’t mean we can’t look to the future, or come
                          up with a laundry list of things we’d like to see make the cut by the time it does. Google hasn’t
                          said anything official about a second Pixel Watch. At the annual I/O event in May 2023, it quickly
                          breezed over WearOS to leave more time to focus on AI, coding and other upcoming hardware like the
                          Pixel Fold smartphone. The only info we have to go on right now is a single tweet from prolific
                          phone leaker EVleaks.

                          got up its rather ample sleeves? We round up all the news and rumours we’ve seen so far about the
                          Google Pixel Watch 2. There’s no official word yet from Google, and the Google I/O event in May
                          2023 came and went without any mention or tease of an update to the smartwatch range, instead only
                          covering the Pixel 7a, Pixel Fold, and Pixel Tablet. Instead, 9to5Google reports that the Pixel
                          Watch 2 will make its debut in October 2023 alongside the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro. Again, there’s
                          no confirmed price details from Google at this point in time. With the Pixel Watch only being
                          released in October 2022, we don’t think there will be too much change from the price of that
                          smartwatch: We don’t know the official specs of the Google Pixel Watch 2 yet, so we’re relying on
                          the rumours that have surfaced so far to give us a clue on what we might see when the new model
                          arrives.

                          Kyodo News via AP) TOKYO (AP) — Former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was assassinated Friday on a
                          street in western Japan by a gunman who opened fire on him from behind as he delivered a campaign
                          speech — an attack that stunned a nation with some of the strictest gun control laws anywhere. The
                          67-year-old Abe, who was Japan’s longest-serving leader when he resigned in 2020, collapsed
                          bleeding and was airlifted to a nearby hospital in Nara, although he was not breathing and his
                          heart had stopped. He was later pronounced dead after receiving massive blood transfusions,
                          officials said. A hearse carrying Abe’s body left the hospital early Saturday to head back to his
                          home in Tokyo. Abe’s wife Akie lowered her head as the vehicle passed before a crowd of
                          journalists. Nara Medical University emergency department chief Hidetada Fukushima said Abe
                          suffered major damage to his heart, along with two neck wounds that damaged an artery. He never
                          regained his vital signs, Fukushima said. Police at the shooting scene arrested Tetsuya Yamagami,
                          41, a former member of Japan’s navy, on suspicion of murder. Police said he used a gun that was
                          obviously homemade — about 15 inches (40 centimeters) long — and they confiscated similar weapons
                          and his personal computer when they raided his nearby one-room apartment.

  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          (Kyodo News via AP) TOKYO (AP) — Japanese prosecutors formally charged the suspect in the
                          assassination of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe with murder, sending him to stand trial, a court
                          said Friday. Tetsuya Yamagami was arrested immediately after allegedly shooting Abe with a homemade
                          gun as the former leader was making a campaign speech in July outside a train station in Nara in
                          western Japan. He then underwent a nearly six-month mental evaluation, which prosecutors said
                          showed he is fit to stand trial. Yamagami was also charged with violating a gun control law,
                          according to the Nara District Court. Police have said Yamagami told them that he killed Abe, one
                          of Japan’s most influential and divisive politicians, because of Abe’s apparent links to a
                          religious group that he hated. In his statements and in social media postings attributed to him,
                          Yamagami said he developed a grudge because his mother had made massive donations to the
                          Unification Church that bankrupted his family and ruined his life. One of his lawyers, Masaaki
                          Furukawa, told The Associated Press on Thursday that Yamagami will have to take responsibility for
                          the serious consequences of his alleged actions and that his defense lawyers will do their best to
                          reduce his sentence. Japanese law allows capital punishment for murder, but experts say the death
                          penalty usually is handed down for multiple killings and Yamagami could get life in prison if
                          convicted.

                          heard and smoke can be seen in the air. Photos show people gathered around the former leader as he

                          beating by the time he reached the hospital, doctors said. The former leader had two gunshot wounds
                          but doctors could not determine the trajectory of the bullets. During surgery, doctors struggled to
                          stem the bleeding. “We took resuscitative measures, but (Abe) unfortunately died,” Hidenori

                          (Yoshikazu Tsuno/Pool Photo via AP) TOKYO (AP) — Japan’s assassinated hawkish former leader, Shinzo
                          Abe, was given a rare state funeral Tuesday full of military pomp and surrounded by throngs of
                          mourners as well as by widespread protests, with thousands taking to the streets in opposition.
                          Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said the publicly financed ceremony was a well-deserved honor for
                          Japan’s longest-serving modern political leader. The event was attended by U.S. Vice President
                          Kamala Harris, Japanese Crown Prince Akishino and other foreign and Japanese dignitaries. Japan’s
                          main political opposition parties boycotted the funeral, which critics say was a reminder of how
                          prewar imperialist governments used state funerals to fan nationalism. The government maintains
                          that the ceremony was not meant to force anyone to honor Abe. But the decision to give him the rare
                          honor — which was made without parliamentary debate or approval — as well as the funeral’s high
                          cost and other controversies have led to anger about the event. The funeral began with Abe’s widow,
                          Akie Abe, in a black formal kimono, walking slowly behind Kishida into the funeral venue, carrying
                          an urn in a wooden box wrapped in a purple cloth with gold stripes. Soldiers in white uniforms took
                          Abe’s ashes and placed them on a pedestal filled with white and yellow chrysanthemums and
                          decorations.

                          Japan bid farewell to former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in an elaborate state funeral Tuesday,
                          despite public opposition to the cost of the event as the country grapples with their late leader’s
                          legacy. Abe, Japan’s longest-serving prime minister, was shot dead during a campaign speech in Nara
                          in July, stunning a nation where gun violence is extremely rare. More than 4,300 guests attended
                          the service at the Nippon Budokan Arena in Tokyo, including foreign dignitaries such as US Vice
                          President Kamala Harris, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Australian Prime Minister Anthony
                          Albanese. Shinzo Abe, Japan's longest-serving prime minister, defined politics for a generation
                          Abe’s ashes were carried into the venue, where the government played a video tribute honoring his
                          life and career. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida then delivered a memorial address, praising Abe’s
                          “courage” and dedication. Other government figures including former Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga –
                          who was Abe’s right hand man for many years – also gave remarks, before attendees laid flower
                          offerings and bowed in turn. Other ceremonial rites on the program include an honor guard, gun
                          salute, and musical performances, before a government reception for visiting foreign dignitaries.
                          Police ramped up security for the event, with public broadcaster NHK reporting that about 20,000
                          police officers were deployed to keep the peace.

                          Nicola took to Insta to post a cute Polaroid selfie with co-star Louisa Harland, who plays Orla
                          McCool on the show. She placed two rainbow pin badges next to the sweet pic, in what appears to be
                          a heartfelt reference to lesbian character Claire. The actress went on to add the caption, "Goodbye
                          Derry Girls, it’s been quite a ride 🌈," seeming to confirm that filming has indeed finished. We're
                          not crying, you're crying. Filming for Derry Girls season 3 was originally supposed to start in
                          June 2020, but was delayed due to the pandemic. However, on 1 November 2021, Nicola shared another
                          Instagram post featuring a behind-the-scenes snap from set, appearing to make the start of
                          production. Posting a very close-up selfie complete with her character Claire's signature fringe
                          and scrunchie pigtails, Nicola wrote, "Guess who’s back in the house #ReturnOfTheWeeLesbian" - in
                          reference to the season 1 episode which saw Claire come out as a lesbian. While it wasn't 100%
                          clear whether filming had properly started, Nicola certainly seemed to be in costume (hey, maybe
                          she just likes to dress up at home to get into character). While Nicola Coughlan has confirmed that
                          she's returning as Claire, the rest of the main cast will remain the same too.

                          Derry Girls is a British teen sitcom, created and written by Lisa McGee, that premiered on 4
                          January 2018 on Channel 4[4] and ran for three series. The channel's most successful comedy since
                          Father Ted, the series was inspired by McGee's own experiences growing up in Derry, Northern
                          Ireland, in the 1990s, during the final years of the Troubles.[5] It stars Saoirse-Monica Jackson,
                          Louisa Harland, Nicola Coughlan, Jamie-Lee O'Donnell, and Dylan Llewellyn as five teenagers living
                          in mid-1990s Derry while attending Our Lady Immaculate College, a fictional girls' Catholic
                          secondary school based on the real-life Thornhill College, where McGee herself studied.[6][7]
                          Produced by British production company Hat Trick Productions, Derry Girls is filmed in Northern
                          Ireland, with most scenes shot on location in Derry and some in Belfast. Although the plot lines of
                          Derry Girls are fictional, the series frequently references actual events of the Troubles and the
                          Northern Ireland peace process, including the 1994 IRA ceasefire announcement, the 1995 visit to
                          Northern Ireland of President Bill Clinton and First Lady Hillary Clinton, and the Good Friday
                          referendum of 1998.

                          The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (Swedish: Nobelpriset i fysiologi eller medicin) is
                          awarded yearly by the Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institute for outstanding discoveries in
                          physiology or medicine. The Nobel Prize is not a single prize, but five separate prizes that,
                          according to Alfred Nobel's 1895 will, are awarded "to those who, during the preceding year, have
                          conferred the greatest benefit to humankind". Nobel Prizes are awarded in the fields of Physics,
                          Chemistry, Physiology or Medicine, Literature, and Peace. The Nobel Prize is presented annually on
                          the anniversary of Alfred Nobel's death, 10 December. As of 2022, 114 Nobel Prizes in Physiology or
                          Medicine have been awarded to 226 laureates, 214 men and 12 women. The first one was awarded in
                          1901 to the German physiologist, Emil von Behring, for his work on serum therapy and the
                          development of a vaccine against diphtheria. The first woman to receive the Nobel Prize in
                          Physiology or Medicine, Gerty Cori, received it in 1947 for her role in elucidating the metabolism
                          of glucose, important in many aspects of medicine, including treatment of diabetes. The most recent
                          Nobel prize was announced by the Karolinska Institute on 3 October 2022, and has been awarded to
                          Swedish Svante Pääbo, for the discoveries concerning the genomes of extinct hominins and human
                          evolution.

                          57][58][59] When Banting published the paper that brought him the Nobel,[60] Paulescu already held
                          a patent for his discovery (10 April 1922, patent no. 6254 (8322) "Pancreina şi procedeul
                          fabricaţiei ei"/"Pancrein and the process of making it", from the Romanian Ministry of Industry and
                          Trade).[61][62][63] The Spanish neurophysiologist Fernando de Castro (1896–1967) was the first to
                          describe arterial chemoreceptors and circumscribe them to the carotid body for the respiratory
                          reflexes in 1926–1928. For many experts, this direct disciple of Santiago Ramón y Cajal deserved to
                          share the Nobel Prize 1938 with the awarded Corneille Heymans, but at that time Spain was immersed
                          in the Spanish Civil War and it seems that the Nobel Board even doubted if he was alive or not,
                          being at the front since almost the beginning of the conflict. Heymans himself recognised the
                          merits of De Castro for the Nobel Prize in different occasions, including a famous talk in
                          Montevideo (Uruguay).[64] In 1949, despite protests from the medical establishment, the Portuguese
                          neurologist António Egas Moniz received the Physiology or Medicine Prize for his development of the
                          prefrontal leucotomy, which he promoted by declaring the procedure's success just 10 days

                          The 2022 Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded to the French author Annie Ernaux "for the courage
                          and clinical acuity with which she uncovers the roots, estrangements and collective restraints of
                          personal memory".[1][2] It was announced by the Swedish Academy on 6 October 2022.[3][4][5] Ernaux
                          was the 16th French writer – the first Frenchwoman – and the 17th female author, to receive the
                          Nobel Prize in Literature.[6][7] Ernaux started her literary career in 1974 with Les Armoires vides
                          ("Cleaned Out"), an autobiographical novel. Very early in her career, she turned away from fiction
                          to focus on autobiography, combining historic and individual experiences. In her different
                          viewpoints, she consistently examines a life marked by strong disparities regarding gender,
                          language and class. Her path to authorship was long and arduous, and all her oeuvres are written in
                          plain language. Her books are followed by a wide readership, and are reviewed in most local and
                          national newspapers in France, as well as being the subject of many radio and television interviews
                          and programmes, and a large and growing international academic literature.

                          At a news conference at the Paris offices of her publisher, Gallimard, Ernaux, 82, promised to keep
                          writing. “To receive the Nobel Prize is, for me, a responsibility to continue,” she said. She felt
                          compelled, in particular, to keep examining the inequality and struggles that women face. “Speaking
                          from my condition as a woman,” she said, “it does not seem to me that we, women, have become equal
                          in freedom, in power.” Ernaux becomes only the 17th woman to have been awarded the prize, which has
                          been given to 119 writers since it was formed in 1901. She is the second woman to receive the prize
                          in three years after Louise Glück, the American poet, was given 2020’s award. While early on in her
                          career Ernaux wrote autobiographical fiction, she quickly cast off any pretense that she was
                          inventing a plot and began writing memoirs, though she has often resisted labeling her work as
                          either fiction or nonfiction. “Everything she writes, every word, is literal and factually true,”
                          said Dan Simon, the founder of Seven Stories Press, which has been publishing Ernaux in English for
                          31 years. “And yet these are tremendous works of the imagination.

Question 181              : Who won the Japanese Grand Prix 2022?
Correct Answers         :  
                          Max Verstappen
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prediction (only positive):
  - Answer              : Max Verstappen
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          Max Verstappen clinched what had long been expected with his win at the 2022 Japanese Grand Prix:
                          this year's drivers' title crown. It makes him a double world champion at 25 and now he's close to
                          breaking Formula 1's record for most wins in a single season, with four events still left to run.
                          But Verstappen's title celebrations were overshadowed by the chaos and confusion during and after
                          the wet race last Sunday, which has led to even more questions being raised about the procedures
                          and attitudes of motorsport's governing body. There was also plenty of intrigue further down the
                          field and off the track too. Here are the headline takeaways from F1's first visit back to Suzuka
                          in three years. Verstappen hugs Adrian Newey after claiming a second F1 world title Photo by: Sam
                          Bloxham / Motorsport Images It had been coming ever since Charles Leclerc crashed out of the lead
                          of the French GP: Verstappen was going to be the 2022 world champion. After his Suzuka triumph and
                          the Ferrari driver's latest error gifting Sergio Perez second, came Verstappen's coronation.
                          Although, as we'll get to soon, not immediately. Having missed his first, slim chance to seal the
                          title in Singapore seven days earlier, Verstappen wrested control in Japan. He edged Leclerc for
                          pole, then beat his rival in the race's two main challenges.

                          Show premieres September 19 on NBC, promotional event happens September 15 In advance of the debut
                          of Quantum Leap September 19, NBC is hosting a promotion that sees gas sell for 91 cents a gallon,
                          as it was in 1985, and movie tickets for $3.55. That happens September 15. The pilot episode is set
                          in 1985. Quantum Leap aired on NBC from 1989 to 1993, with Scott Bakula starring. In the new
                          Quantum Leap, Raymond Lee plays Dr. Ben Seong. Both the gas and movie ticket promotions have a
                          “while supplies last” caveat attached, and the gas event happens in Los Angeles. “Visit our Los
                          Angeles gas station activation to receive gas at 1985 prices,” NBC said. Activation involves
                          driving to a “check-in lot” on North Vine Street to get the gas pass. The drive-through experience
                          while waiting for gas includes entering the “Quantum Accelerator,” ‘80s trivia, break-dancers and
                          snacks. Customers can get up to ten gallons of gas. The movie promotion is a partnership with
                          Fandango and involves a promo code. NBC calls the event Quantum Leap Day. More information can be
                          found at www.quantumleapday.com. The show’s logline reads: “It’s been 30 years since Dr. Sam
                          Beckett stepped into the Quantum Leap accelerator and vanished.

                          works. What you need to know about Nvidia's new GeForce RTX 4090 The Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 is now
                          available. This GPU is currently among the most powerful on the market, and if you want to play the
                          latest games at the highest framerates, you'll need the best gaming PCs packing high-octane cards
                          like this one. Presently, the GeForce RTX 4090 is the top-of-the-line card in Nvidia's 40-series of
                          GeForce RTX GPUs, which were officially announced in September 2022. The Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080
                          and 4090 were unveiled during Nvidia's September 2022 GTC keynote. Together, they've established a
                          new high-water mark for what we can expect from consumer-grade graphics cards. At that Nvidia
                          event, we learned when these cards are coming out, how much they'll cost, and what kind of power we
                          ought to expect from them. The Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 is the cream of the crop — here's everything
                          you need to know about it. The Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 went on sale on October 12, 2022. The card
                          has a starting price of $1,599. That's roughly as much as the rest of the PC you'll put it in will
                          cost, so start saving now!

                          Nvidia's RTX 4060 is right around the corner, so it's really no surprise that the first benchmarks
                          are already starting to leak out. Today, two tests have been spotted, and they bode pretty well for
                          the GPU. The RTX 3060, which is still a favorite among Nvidia users, might be around 20% slower
                          than the upcoming Ada Lovelace model. Will the RTX 4060 become one of the best GPUs, or at least
                          one of the most popular models in this generation? One might think that a GPU that costs over
                          $40,000 is going to be the best graphics card for gaming, but the truth is a lot more complex than
                          that. In fact, this Nvidia GPU can't even keep up with integrated graphics solutions. Now, before

                          capabilities, it also doesn't have any coolers. This is because, again, you'd find this GPU in a
                          data center or server setting, where it'd be cooled with powerful external fans. Nvidia has just
                          quietly announced the official release date of the RTX 4060. The GPU is coming out on June 29 and
                          will be priced at $299.

                          Telling the true story of one of the NBA greats, 'Sweetwater' is just around the corner. Sports
                          biopics have a long illustrious history within cinema, and in recent years they have taken our
                          screens by storm. Some standout favorites include the likes of Craig Gillespie's I, Tonya starring
                          Margot Robbie, the recent Netflix biopic The Swimmers, and the highly-praised Ford v Ferrari. The
                          hunger for more sports biopics is great, and the eyes of the world constantly await the next
                          offering. Well, one such offering is just around the corner, in the form of Martin Guigui's
                          Sweetwater (2023). Telling the tale of Nat Clifton, an NBA Hall of Famer, the film itself has been
                          in the works since 2007 and is finally being released this year. Of course, we know that the movie
                          will be about the life of Nat Clifton, but a film cannot simply show every aspect of a person's
                          life, and will often choose a specific period of importance. The official plot synopsis of
                          Sweetwater reads: "The film follows Clifton, who is the star attraction of the Harlem
                          Globetrotters, led by owner/coach Abe Saperstein.

Question 186              : When did the Google Pixel Watch start sell?
Correct Answers         :  
                          October 13, Oct 13, Oct. 13, 13 October, 13 Oct, 13 Oct.

                          This makes the Pixel Watch a bit more affordable than the Apple Watch Series 8 ($399) but pricier
                          than the Galaxy Watch 5 ($279) and recently-released Fitbit Sense 2 ($299). (See the rest of the
                          differences between the Google Pixel Watch vs. Fitbit Sense 2.) The Pixel Watch release date was
                          October 13, 2022, and since then we're continuing to track the best Pixel Watch deals. Note that
                          the Pixel Watch launched alongside the Google Pixel 7 and Google Pixel 7 Pro, which would both make
                          ideal companion devices for the company's smartwatch. The Google Pixel Watch is a simple-looking
                          smartwatch, I might even call it minimalistic. It comes in just one size: 41mm. Those with larger
                          wrists might complain about the lack of a larger option; that said, it fit me perfectly. The face
                          features a rounded design with a 3D glass dome. This raised effect distracts from the display's
                          thick bezel, but doesn't change the fact that a good chunk of the display is unusable. Perhaps my
                          prior experience with Samsung watches is to blame? I can't help but think it's a missed opportunity
                          to incorporate in digital rotating bezel in that space. It seems like no mistake that the Pixel
                          Watch is a "dark mode" device. The interface and all of Google's watch faces have black backgrounds
                          to further conceal the bezel.

                          the Pixel Watch "good-but-not-yet-great".[63] Wired's Julian Chokkattu echoed these sentiments, but
                          argued that its "accuracy, elegance, and comfort" compensated its shortcomings.[64] CNN Underscored
                          reviewer Max Buondonno praised the Pixel Watch's sleek design and the performance of Wear OS 3.5,
                          but felt that the battery life was subpar and the screen was not large enough.

                          recipient in recognition of her support of military caregivers by the Elizabeth Dole Foundation.
                          The award will be presented at the foundation’s annual Heroes & History Makers celebration, on Oct.
                          19 at The Anthem in Washington, DC, and streamed live. The event is EDF’s annual tribute to
                          America’s 5.5 million military caregivers. Sen. Elizabeth Dole will be joined by Hidden Heroes
                          Campaign Chair Tom Hanks and multi-platinum, global entertainer Chris Young. The Caregiver Champion
                          Award was named for Hanks in recognition of his outstanding support of military caregivers. The
                          award has previously been presented to former First Lady Michelle Obama, music superstar Tim
                          McGraw, and actor and humanitarian Gary Sinise. Guthrie was selected in recognition of her devoted
                          advocacy of those who serve and their families. Since joining EDF as a Hidden Heroes Ambassador in
                          2018, Guthrie has used her platform to bring awareness to the 5.5 million loved ones caring for a
                          wounded, ill, or injured service member at home. “Over the past four years, she has become deeply
                          invested in our cause,” said Steve Schwab, CEO of the Elizabeth Dole Foundation. ‘She has brought
                          our caregivers' stories of service and sacrifice into millions of homes across America.

                          Dole was the first to call the nation’s attention to the men and women caring for a wounded, ill,
                          or injured service member or veteran at home. Military caregivers face increased emotional and
                          physical stress, financial and legal troubles, employment difficulties, and feelings of isolation
                          due to the enormous responsibility and severe lack of resources for those caring for someone who
                          served. The Foundation is committed to recognizing, supporting, and empowering military caregivers.

                          Alliance and NYC Parks announced today that longtime New York City public servant Morgan Monaco
                          will become the new President of the Alliance, the non-profit that operates the park in partnership
                          with the City, and also the Prospect Park Administrator, a public appointment by NYC Parks. Monaco,
                          whose public sector career spans both government and non-profit organizations, brings extensive
                          knowledge of park equity and community development to the position, as well as strong leadership in
                          driving sustainable impact for civic organizations. Monaco is the first Black leader of the
                          Alliance, further diversifying executive leadership within the open space sector, and continues the
                          legacy of female leadership at the Alliance over the course of its 35-year history. Monaco succeeds
                          former Prospect Park Alliance President Sue Donoghue, who was appointed New York City Parks
                          Commissioner earlier this year. Monaco looks forward to working with the board, staff and most

                          and recognizing the ways in which the park has been an invaluable resource for New Yorkers to
                          recover, she looks forward to strengthening the organization’s capacity in order to keep pace with
                          the needs of the park community and the robust use of the park. She plans to leverage her
                          experience in working on citywide equity initiatives and serving vulnerable communities to explore
                          the ways in which the Alliance can bring more social services to the park.

                          Parks Commissioner. Serving as the President of Prospect Park Alliance and Park Administrator has
                          been one of the great honors of my career. I’ve been so lucky to work alongside so many dedicated
                          people, from Alliance and NYC Parks staff, to our incredibly hardworking volunteers and community
                          advocates, and a devoted Board of Directors that has provided the Alliance exceptional guidance and
                          leadership. I’m honored to be taking on a citywide leadership role in caring for New York City’s
                          most essential resource, its parks and open spaces, and I will continue to cherish and support

                          35-years-young organization. During this time we’ve advanced the park in numerous ways: rebounding

                          Alliance and NYC Parks announced today that longtime New York City public servant Morgan Monaco
                          will become the new President of the Alliance, the non-profit that operates the park in partnership
                          with the City, and also the Prospect Park Administrator, a public appointment by NYC Parks. Monaco,
                          whose public sector career spans both government and non-profit organizations, brings extensive
                          knowledge of park equity and community development to the position, as well as strong leadership in
                          driving sustainable impact for civic organizations. Monaco is the first Black leader of the
                          Alliance, further diversifying executive leadership within the open space sector, and continues the
                          legacy of female leadership at the Alliance over the course of its 35-year history. Monaco succeeds
                          former Prospect Park Alliance President Sue Donoghue, who was appointed New York City Parks
                          Commissioner earlier this year. Monaco looks forward to working with the board, staff and most
                          especially park users to help shape her vision for the park’s future. Coming out of the pandemic
                          and recognizing the ways in which the park has been an invaluable resource for New Yorkers to
                          recover, she looks forward to strengthening the organization’s capacity in order to keep pace with
                          the needs of the park community and the robust use of the park. She plans to leverage her
                          experience in working on citywide equity initiatives and serving vulnerable communities to explore
                          the ways in which the Alliance can bring more social services to the park.

Question 189              : What gaming software development studio did Riot Games acquire?
Correct Answers         :  
                          Wargaming Sydney

  - Source              :
                          By Jess Weatherbed, a news writer focused on creative industries, computing, and internet culture.
                          Jess started her career at TechRadar, covering news and hardware reviews. Video game developer and
                          publisher Riot Games has announced its acquisition of Wargaming Sydney, a gaming software
                          development studio that’s part of Cyprus-based Wargaming, the publisher behind titles such as World
                          of Tanks and World of Warships. Riot did not disclose the price of the purchase. Wargaming Sydney
                          is one of the largest games studios in Australia, formed under its original name of BigWorld back
                          in 2002. It was by Wargaming in 2012. The studio has created game development tools and other
                          software architecture required to develop online games such as MMOs. After the acquisition by Riot,
                          Wargaming Sydney will be renamed Riot Sydney and will assist in the development of Riot games such
                          as Valorant and League of Legends. Wargaming will maintain ownership of BigWorld Technology
                          Wargaming Sydney is the only operation being acquired by Riot Games, with other studios under the
                          Wargaming name unaffected by the purchase. Wargaming will also maintain ownership of BigWorld
                          technology’s gaming software architecture for its existing products. Riot says the newly branded
                          Riot Sydney will be a key contributor to its network of development studios.

  - Source              :
                          Here's Gowrappan's memo to Yahoo staff: Team - We've entered a new chapter in our history, and I am
                          tremendously proud of all that we have accomplished together over the past three years. Like the
                          start of any next chapter, this is a natural moment for transition. I've made the decision to take
                          on a new role as a senior advisor to Apollo. This role will enable me to support our next phase of
                          growth and continued investment in the company. As such, I am excited to welcome Jim Lanzone as the
                          new CEO of Yahoo effective September 27, 2021. Jim is a veteran technology and media leader with
                          two decades of leadership experience and a deep track record of growth, innovation and an
                          entrepreneurial spirit. I have every confidence he will be a terrific leader for the new Yahoo. Jim
                          and I will work together to ensure a seamless transition, and I'm confident he will build on our
                          successes and lead us into our future. What an incredible journey this has been. I joined the
                          company three years ago as part of Verizon. Today, we're a standalone company with significant
                          potential to grow beyond what we have accomplished thus far. We have the best team, with the right
                          products, content and technology to shape the future of Yahoo. To reiterate what's been said many
                          times over the past few months – this next chapter is a testament to the great work you've
                          delivered against a focused strategy.

  - Source              :
                          Peloton's new CEO Barry McCarthy is known in tech circles and on Wall Street as Mr. No Bullshit.
                          Direct. No nonsense. A deep strategic thinker who wants to get stuff done yesterday. A man who
                          likes golf, but enjoys explaining the intricacies of tech subscription models and the ins and outs
                          of a balance sheet perhaps way more. And overall McCarthy, 69, lived up to all of that external
                          branding in an exclusive 30-minute Zoom chat with Yahoo Finance. "I could have stayed in
                          retirement," McCarthy said, decked out in his trademark vest and glasses and looking not too far
                          removed from fit Peloton instructor status. "It's pretty clear to me there are only one or two
                          outcomes for me here — either I'm coming home in defeat or I'm coming out victorious." McCarthy's
                          resume suggests victory is not out of reach. It includes being the innovative architect of
                          Spotify's 2018 direct listing. At Spotify, he was CFO for several years before retiring in 2019,
                          working closely with founder Daniel Ek. Before then, he worked alongside Netflix's founder Reed
                          Hastings to build the streaming giant into a powerhouse. Peloton hired McCarthy as its no-nonsense
                          sheriff several weeks ago — to work alongside founder and now executive chairman John Foley — after
                          several challenging quarters, operationally and reputation wise. To be sure, McCarthy has a lot on
                          his plate from the jump — something you pick up on within the first five minutes of our chat.

                          new episode 4 of Chicago PD’s current season 10. It turns out that the writers decided to name it,
                          “DONDE VIVES.” It sounds like episode 4 will feature some more very scandalous, intense, dramatic,
                          interesting, action-filled and suspenseful scenes. In the new episode 4, a shocking murder and a

Question 193              : How much does the YouTube Premium family plan cost now?
Correct Answers         :  
                          22.99 per month
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prediction (only positive):

                          If you subscribe to a YouTube Premium family plan, you may want to check your email: Google is
                          notifying users that the monthly cost of the service will be going up by $5 a month. Starting in
                          November, most users will start paying $22.99 per month for YouTube Premium — though there seems to
                          be some leeway. While the main announcement says that the price increase starts on the next billing
                          cycle on or after November 21st, some legacy subscribers won't see their bill jump for several
                          months. One Engadget staffer was informed that their price would not increase until April due to
                          their status as a "long-standing and valued member." With the new price structure, the family plan
                          is less of a bargain for smaller groups. At $17.99, buying into the family plan for just two users
                          offered a significant savings over individual accounts. Now, a two-user family will save only $1 a
                          month. For now, however, single-user prices remain the same: $11.99 a month for individual accounts
                          and $6.99 for students. The benefits haven't changed either, with Premium still offering users an
                          ad-free YouTube experience, the ability to download videos for offline viewing, access to YouTube
                          Music, and the ability to continue to play music and videos in the background or with your phone
                          screen off. At least you still don't need to subscribe to Premium to watch videos in 4K.

                          However, after killing off YouTube Originals in early 2022, YouTube opened up access to most
                          YouTube Originals for everyone. Now, free users can watch YouTube Originals content with ads, just
                          like any other video. The company vaguely states that "only select episodes may be available for
                          streaming at a given time," but in our experience, the majority of Originals content is open to
                          all. Being a YouTube Premium member still has some perks in regards to Originals, though. In
                          addition to ad-free access, subscribers get access to bonus content like deleted scenes and
                          director's cuts. Have a look at the YouTube Originals channel to see what's available. Some videos,
                          marked as Premium, are only available for subscribers. Whether you're interested in anything on

                          platforms, YouTube Music is available for free. With YouTube Music Premium, you also get ad-free

                          listening. YouTube Music Premium costs $9.99/month on its own, so it adds quite a bit of value to
                          YouTube Premium. If you don't already subscribe to Spotify, Apple Music, or similar, then you can
                          enjoy two types of subscriptions under one umbrella.

Question 194              : What is the release date of God of War Ragnarok?

                          Sony just had a successful release of one of its premiered games. More than four years after the
                          original, God of War gets the much-awaited sequel in God of War: Ragnarok. GoW: Ragnarok was
                          released on November 9, 2022, and was positively received by critics and the gaming community. It
                          is safe to say it lived up to the hype and exceeded expectations. But, since it’s a Sony-exclusive
                          title, God of War: Ragnarok was only released on the PlayStation 4 and 5. However, the first
                          installment to this beloved franchise got the opportunity to be ported for PC gamers after four
                          years since it was conceived. This leaves us with the question – When will God of War: Ragnarok
                          come to PC? Plus, what are God of War: Ragnarok’s basic PC requirements so my computer can run
                          smoothly? We will answer all of that for you in this article. Please enable JavaScript God of War
                          was released for PlayStation 4 on August 20, 2018. It was until January 14, 2022, that fans of
                          Kratos were able to embark on his epic God-slaying adventures on PC. That’s almost four years of
                          waiting which is roughly the estimated time for PlayStation games before they get an official
                          release on PC. Although there is no official announcement from Sony that GoW: Ragnarok will be
                          arriving on PC soon, the chances of it becoming true are very high.

                          Bat-Family. She loves ripping around the streets of Gotham City on her motorcycle and always wants
                          to be in the center of the action. Leah Lewis is represented by Commercial Talent Agency, Paradigm,
                          Strong Management, Morris, Yorn, Barnes, Levine, Krintzman, Rubenstein, Kohner & Gellman.
                          Additional cast and characters will be announced at a later time. They are a team of incredible
                          crimefighters who have banded together to oppose evil, combat crime and clean up the streets of
                          Gotham City. They are…okay, they’re NOT Batman and Robin. They’re the Batwheels – an awesome group
                          of sentient super-powered crime-fighting vehicles defending Gotham City alongside Batman, Robin,
                          Batgirl and a host of DC Super Heroes. Having just been created by the Batcomputer, our heroes are
                          essentially kids with little to no life experience. Led by Bam (The Batmobile), the Batwheels –
                          Bibi (The Batgirl Cycle), Redbird (Robin’s Sports Car), The Batwing and Buff (The Bat Truck) – must
                          navigate the growing pains of being a newly formed super team as well as the growing pains that
                          come with just being a kid.

                          110] On 22 October, it was reported that Sunak had the required number of supporters—100 members of
                          the House of Commons—to run in the ballot on 24 October. The total number of MPs who publicly
                          declared support passed 100 on the afternoon of 22 October.[111] On 23 October, Sunak declared that
                          he would stand for election.[112] After Johnson ruled himself out of the race and Penny Mordaunt
                          withdrew her candidacy, Sunak was announced as the new Conservative leader on 24 October.[113]
                          Following Truss's resignation, Sunak, as the Leader of the Conservative Party, became prime
                          minister on 25 October 2022, after accepting King Charles III's invitation to form a
                          government.[114] He is both the first British Asian and the first Hindu prime minister of the
                          United Kingdom. In his first speech as prime minister, Sunak promised "integrity, professionalism
                          and accountability," and said that "we will create a future worthy of the sacrifices so many have
                          made and fill tomorrow, and everyday thereafter with hope."[115] Of his predecessor, Sunak said
                          that Truss "was not wrong" to want to improve growth, but admitted that "some mistakes were made",
                          and that he was elected prime minister in part to fix them. He promised to "place economic
                          stability and confidence at the heart of this government's agenda".[116] Sunak began to appoint his
                          cabinet on 25 October 2022.

                          ‘groundbreaking milestone’ as Rishi Sunak becomes British Prime Minister. Sunak will be the first
                          person of color to lead the United Kingdom. (Oct. 25) LONDON (AP) — Rishi Sunak became Britain’s
                          third prime minister this year on Tuesday, tasked with taming an economic crisis that has left the
                          country’s finances in a precarious state and millions struggling to pay their food and energy
                          bills. Sunak, who is the U.K.’s first leader of color, met King Charles III at Buckingham Palace,
                          where the monarch officially asked the new leader of the governing Conservative Party to form a
                          government, as is tradition. Sunak clinched the leadership position Monday, seen by his party as a
                          safe pair of hands to stabilize an economy sliding toward recession — and stem its own plunging
                          popularity, after the brief, disastrous term of Liz Truss. Her package of unfunded tax cuts spooked
                          financial markets with the prospect of ballooning debt, drove the pound to record lows and forced
                          the Bank of England to intervene — weakening Britain’s fragile economy and obliterating Truss’
                          authority within her party. In one of his first acts, Sunak announced he would retain Treasury
                          chief Jeremy Hunt, appointed by Truss to steady the markets two weeks ago amid the turmoil. His
                          removal would have set off new tremors.

                          (born May 12, 1980, Southampton, England), British politician and financier who became leader of
                          the Conservative Party and prime minster of the United Kingdom in October 2022. Previously he
                          served as chancellor of the Exchequer (2020–22). Sunak was born into a family with immigrant roots.
                          His grandparents emigrated from Punjab, in northwestern India, to East Africa, where his mother and
                          father were born in Tanzania and Kenya, respectively. They met and married after their families
                          migrated in the 1960s to Southampton in southern England. Sunak’s father became a general
                          practitioner for the National Health Service. His mother, a pharmacist, owned and operated a small
                          pharmacy, for which Sunak, the eldest of their three children, would eventually keep the books.
                          Later, during his political career, Sunak would draw parallels between his experiences working in
                          the family business and the values he gained from them and those of Conservative Party icon
                          Margaret Thatcher, the daughter of a grocer. As a result of his parents’ sacrifices and saving to
                          fund his education, Sunak was able to attend Winchester College, the exclusive private school that
                          has produced no fewer than six chancellors of the Exchequer.

                          Like many of you, I find Netflix occupies my television screen about once every two weeks since I’m
                          not champing at the bit to experience a litany of identical documentaries focused on minor Twitter
                          story lines from the previous year. (Seriously, how the hell are there two GameStonk
                          documentaries?) In short, Netflix isn’t something I want to spend $240 on each year anymore — its
                          salad days are a distant memory — and the company is finally starting to empathize with my
                          reasoning. Basic With Ads is functionally identical to Netflix’s $10 Basic plan. You’re capped at a
                          720p resolution for all of your playback options and are allowed to use only one device on the
                          subscription at a time. (So no, you can’t engineer some sort of weird multi-apartment Bridgerton
                          marathon.) The only sacrifice you need to make to get the $3 discount is to sit through the four
                          minutes of total advertising time that occupied, say, season one, episode two of Stranger Things,
                          which I fired up on my Roku for a test-drive. (Yes, I’m a little late to the Upside Down party.)
                          The first thing I saw on my television was a dewy, luxurious promo for Louis Vuitton, which frankly
                          read as a pointed barb to my newfound money-saving mind-set. Yes, Netflix believes that even those
                          pivoting to Basic With Ads can afford the good life.

Question 200              : Where does The White Lotus Season 2 take place
Correct Answers         :  
                          Sicily

  - Source              :
                          This is a core theme in the first season of The White Lotus; White found that “Hawaii is a very
                          paradisiacal and idyllic place,” but its economy is dominated by tourists and military contractors
                          who are largely unaware of the issues of American imperialism. Ironically, Season 1 was filmed
                          amidst the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic when the tourism industry had been facing many setbacks.
                          This gave production designer Laura Fox the opportunity to spend time redesigning the artwork,
                          sets, and scenery in each room featured in the series; The White Lotus fans have enjoyed analyzing
                          the background details for hidden Easter eggs, and Fox herself compared the subtle menace of the
                          hotel to The Shining. Between assassination attempts, mafia, familial conflict, and beautiful
                          Italian scenery, The White Lotus: Sicily had a lot in common with The Godfather. Similar to Francis
                          Ford Coppola’s 1972 crime classic, season 2 was filmed on location in Italy. The San Domenico
                          Palace, Taormina stands in for the clifftop resort in the series. Additionally, White makes use of
                          several local wonders, including the Ionian Sea, the Greek Theater of Teatro Antico di Taormina,
                          and the active Mount Etna volcano, which erupts in the final episode, “Arrivederci.” Considering
                          that The White Lotus: Sicily focuses on the issues of colonialism, it makes sense that the series
                          was filmed in a location with a complex history.

                          'White Lotus' Season 2 Theories That Didn't Happen The first season of The White Lotus takes place
                          in the Hawaiian resort, which is decorated and designed to reflect the local cultural practices (or
                          at least the way that they are perceived by tourists); there’s a particularly entertaining
                          storyline where the hotel manager Armond (Murray Bartlett) and the brutish guest Shane Patton (Jake
                          Lacy) get into a dispute over the “Pineapple Room.” In reality, the Four Seasons Maui features
                          one-bedroom suites that overlook Wailea Beach and cost over $9,000 a night. White had grown
                          interested in telling a story set in Hawaii after filming episodes of his show Enlightened. He said
                          that “the colonial legacy is still a living issue,” and that he learned more about the United
                          States’ annexation of Hawaii in 1898 and the lack of self-determination granted to Indigenous
                          groups as a result of his experience.

                          This projection was based on a variety of metrics, including generic ballot testing that favored a
                          Republican-led Congress as well as President Biden’s low approval rating, which hovers around 40%.
                          Super PACS and political party groups were spending money almost exclusively in districts that
                          President Biden won in 2020, indicating that Democrats were in a defensive crouch. Midterm
                          elections often benefit the opposition political party at the expense of the White House’s party.
                          1994 and 2010 were typical midterm elections, where Republicans made gains in the House at the
                          midpoint of Bill Clinton and Barack Obama’s first terms. Similarly, in 2018, Republican’s got
                          crushed in House elections but picked up two seats in the Senate. If a president’s approval ratings
                          are high, then the presiding party typically fares better in midterm House elections. For example,
                          in 1998, Bill Clinton’s approval rating was 66%, and Democrats retained control of the House. In
                          2002, George W. Bush polled at a 63%, and Republicans made gains. Currently, Biden’s approval
                          rating is 42%, which is similar to former president Barack Obama’s rating in 2010. That year,
                          Democrats lost control of the House, similar to what occurred during this year’s midterms. After
                          each census, congressional district lines are redrawn. This Nov. 8 election was the first general
                          election since the redistricting process concluded.

                          "Lullaby" is a song by English rock band the Cure from their eighth studio album, Disintegration
                          (1989). Released as a single on 10 April 1989, the song is the band's highest-charting single in
                          their home country, reaching number five on the UK Singles Chart. It additionally reached number
                          three in West Germany and Ireland while becoming a top-10 hit in several other European countries
                          and New Zealand. The music video, directed by Tim Pope, won the British Video of the Year at the
                          1990 Brit Awards. The meaning of "Lullaby" has been speculated by fans, including as a metonymy for
                          addiction, depression, or sexual assault,[2] and Smith has offered multiple explanations as to its
                          theme or content, such as childhood nightmares or abuse.[2] One explanation by Smith follows that
                          the song is about the disturbing songs his father sung to him as a kid, and the horrible ending
                          they would always have.[3] Tim Pope, a long-time collaborator of the Cure on many of its music
                          videos, interprets "Lullaby" as an allegory for lead singer Robert Smith's drug-addled past.[4]
                          Upon its release, "Lullaby" became the Cure's highest-charting hit in their home country when it
                          reached number five on the UK Singles Chart. It remains their only single to reach the top five in
                          the United Kingdom.

                          wedding to Peter Neal. On 19 November, the 28-year-old attorney married fiancé and fellow lawyer
                          Neal on the South Lawn of the White House, the 19th wedding to be held at the Executive Mansion
                          since 1800. The celebration also marked the first White House wedding with a president’s
                          granddaughter as the bride, and the first one on the South Lawn, according to the White House
                          Historical Association. In a recent Vogue cover story documenting Naomi’s big day, it was revealed
                          the bride made a number of wardrobe changes throughout the evening. Naomi, the daughter of Hunter
                          Biden and Kathleen Buhle, walked down the aisle wearing a high-neck, long-sleeved Chantilly lace
                          dress designed by Ralph Lauren. The dress was paired with a cathedral-length silk organza veil,
                          featuring a matching Chantilly lace border. She completed the look with a pair of diamond-encrusted
                          Tiffany & Co platinum earrings, according to CNN. The drop earrings reportedly contain South Sea
                          pearls, which are listed for $9,300 per pair on the Tiffany website.

Question 207              : What grouping is France in World Cup 2022?

                          World Cup holders France are off to a strong start in Group D, where they are favorites to advance
                          as the group leaders. Their 4-1 come-from-behind victory over Australia is a sign that they are not

                          are tipped to be the team best equipped to lay claim to the other knockout round berth on offer,
                          but a 0-0 draw against Tunisia could hurt their chances. The Danes will now be sweating their Round
                          of 16 berth given Australia did what they couldn't against Tunisia. The Socceroos claimed a 1-0 win
                          over Tunisia to give themselves a shot at the Round of 16 in their group finale. That Australia vs.
                          Denmark match on Wednesday will essentially serve as a playoff for a berth into the knockout
                          rounds. It's worth noting that this group has reunited three teams that faced each other at the

                          than 30 years, led by a talented crop of young players. Morocco has seen some tumult following its
                          quarterfinal exit at AFCON, but Chelsea winger Hakim Ziyech is back after a spell away from the
                          national team. Then there’s Croatia: Only four years removed from a trip to the World Cup final in

                          Brazilians will contend for their country’s sixth World Cup (and first since 2002) with one of the
                          deepest squads in Qatar. With stars like Paris Saint-Germain’s Neymar and Real Madrid’s Vinícius
                          Júnior, A Seleção enters the World Cup with just one loss — to rival Argentina in July 2021 — in
                          its past 29 matches. It will be hard to stop a team as talent-laden as Brazil from finishing first
                          here, but the other three countries will battle it out for the group’s second place in the knockout
                          stage.

                          staff before making changes. Coming off a big win on Black Friday, Huskers are most interested in

                          over the next couple of days.” Alberts said the decision about whether to keep Joseph was entirely

                          Across the Yahoo Network Thu, October 27, 2022 at 2:01:02 PM EDT The voice behind TikTok’s
                          text-to-speech feature has spoken — and she’s a Canadian local radio host. Kat Callaghan hosts The
                          Beat on 91.5 FM in Ontario. She also made a major reveal this month: She’s the voice of TikTok’s
                          text-to-speech feature. Iconic! Callaghan confessed in her very first TikTok video. For a long time
                          I didn’t say a word. But … yes it’s me and yes I have an ongoing awesome relationship with the
                          folks at TikTok. 🎉 The coolest part for me is watching the creativity & awesome content that people
                          are putting out there using my voice. (Also oddly enough this is my first TikTok) “When you guys
                          have been asking me if I’m the voice on TikTok,” the text-to-speech caption said. “Finally I can
                          tell you guys: It is me,” Callaghan said in her authentic voice. In the caption, she explained that
                          she has an awesome ongoing relationship with TikTok. “The coolest part for me is watching the
                          creativity & awesome content that people are putting out there using my voice,” Callaghan wrote.
                          The video received over 29.4 million views. Some were in shock, but not everyone believed she was
                          the voice they had heard for so long.

                          “I’m not convinced but just wanted to be here before it blows up,” someone commented. “Omg I didn’t
                          know it was a real person behind the voice until now…” another said. “Finally the voice matches the
                          face in my brain,” a TikToker wrote. “Idk why I’m not 100% convinced,” a user replied. “Am I the
                          only one that watched 100 times to check if the voices matched?” a person added. Let’s see if this
                          does it. In an update, she explained that considering she is a voice actor for a living, lying
                          about something like this would be pretty bad for her career. Then Callaghan gave the people what
                          they wanted and spoke using her text-to-speech voice. The sound is uncanny! More from In The Know:

                          By Jacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge
                          in 2012, he’s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk. TikTok has
                          agreed to settle a lawsuit with Bev Standing, the voice actress who said she was behind the app’s
                          original text-to-speech voice. Standing sued TikTok in May, saying that the app was using her voice
                          without permission. A robotic version of what sounded like Standing’s voice had been in the app for
                          months, speaking over what felt like every other video at the time. A lawyer for Standing said the
                          settlement was still being finalized and details around payment could not be disclosed. “They’ve
                          reached an amicable resolution,” Robert Sciglimpaglia, who represents Standing, said in a phone
                          call with The Verge. Sciglimpaglia said TikTok would license Standing’s voice as part of the
                          agreement, but it’s up to TikTok whether or not to use it. TikTok did not immediately respond to a
                          request for comment. Standing said her voice was meant to be used for Chinese translations It
                          sounds as though some strange mixup led to Standing’s voice being used by TikTok in the first
                          place. Standing said that she made recordings for a text-to-speech feature “several years ago” but
                          that they were meant to be used for translations of Chinese texts. No one else was supposed to use
                          them.

                          Interest in this word spiked in March 2022 due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. As the United
                          States and other countries put sanctions on Russian oligarchs, several people searched the term to
                          understand what it means. This is an acronym which, according to Merriam-Webster, stands for
                          “lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning (one’s sexual or gender identity),
                          intersex, and asexual/aromantic/agender.” It was frequently searched during June, which is Pride
                          Month. When Queen Elizabeth II died this year, announcements of her death mentioned King Charles
                          III and identified his wife Camilla as the Queen Consort. That word rapidly became the subject of
                          many Merriam-Webster searches. This word gained popularity in June when an engineer at Google
                          stated that a company AI chatbot had human-esque consciousness. As a result, lookups of the term
                          went up by 480%. This term refers to the process which allows Congress to create laws. When Roe v.
                          Wade was overturned in June 2022, searches for the word increased by a massive 193%. Sources: Our

                          after the final in Qatar on Sunday. Here is what you need to know about their route to the title: *
                          The top two in each World Cup group advance to the last 16. The knockout rounds, which began on
                          Dec. 3, feature one-off matches, which can go to extra time and penalties to decide the winners. *
                          Argentina recovered from their shock defeat to Saudi Arabia with back-to-back wins over Mexico and
                          Poland to finish as winners of Group C. * Lionel Messi and Julian Alvarez scored in Argentina's 2-1
                          win over Australia in their Round of 16 tie. * Argentina beat the Netherlands 4-3 in a penalty
                          shootout in their quarter-final tie, after Nahuel Molina and Messi's goals were cancelled out by a
                          brace from Dutch substitute Wout Weghorst. * Argentina beat Croatia 3-0 in the semi-finals, with
                          Messi coolly putting away a spot kick in the 34th minute to open the scoring before Alvarez found
                          the net either side of halftime.

                          Berhalter announced on the eve of Monday’s Group B opener vs. Wales (2 pm ET | FOX, Telemundo). The
                          Leeds United midfielder and New York Red Bulls homegrown product will be the USMNT’s youngest
                          captain since Walter Bahr at the 1950 World Cup. He’s already worn the armband nine times during 32
                          career international appearances. “We think he has great leadership capabilities,” Berhalter said
                          of the 23-year-old Wappingers Falls, New York native. “He leads by his actions and his words.” FIFA
                          requires teams to name a singular captain for the tournament; the USMNT were the last of 32
                          Qatar-qualified squads to complete that task. During Berhalter’s tenure, the USMNT have relied on a
                          leadership council and rotating armband responsibilities. Chelsea forward Christian Pulisic and
                          Nashville SC center back Walker Zimmerman were other leading candidates to be named captain. “A lot
                          of credit to my teammates,” Adams said, “because anyone throughout our leadership council can wear
                          that armband and represent us with pride and represent us in the right way." Adams debuted for the
                          Red Bulls in 2016 before moving to Europe in the winter of 2019, then to German Bundesliga side RB
                          Leipzig.

                          Sarachan recalled that during the team's first training session, he had to rein Adams in. "He
                          covered more ground in 10 minutes than I had seen a lot of my players cover in one training
                          session," Sarachan said. "It's like when you go to buy a car and the salesman goes in the car with
                          you, usually you start out kind of easy and he'll tell you to get on the highway. Tyler just
                          floored it." Sarachan stops short of saying he knew Adams would captain the US side, but he saw
                          some of the same building blocks Bedoya did in terms of work ethic and preparation. Over time,
                          those traits made even more of an impression. "When you think of leadership qualities, certain
                          boxes need to be checked," Sarachan said. "You have to have confidence, you have to be humble, you
                          have to have a work ethic, there's a lot more subsets to it. And being a young kid, I didn't know
                          how that would play out. But once we got into 2018, it didn't take long for me to know that, 'OK,
                          this kid's got what it takes to be a leader other than his youth.' I look back and think about that
                          Portugal week, the signs were there for sure." Now Adams is a man in full.

                          referred to Zoom. Still, Zoom has become the app used by everyone from the Federal Reserve to
                          everyday Americans trying to keep their social lives afloat. In its most recent quarter, Zoom saw
                          year-over-year revenue growth of 367%, with the number of customers who spent more than $100,000 in
                          the trailing 12 months growing 136% year-over-year. And investors have been watching. Zoom’s stock
                          price has skyrocketed in the last 12 months, jumping an incredible 475% from $71.90 in January to
                          $410.01 as of the close of markets on Dec. 4. It’s for all of those reasons that Zoom is Yahoo

                          (LYFT), and Uber (UBER). But Zoom, unlike its contemporaries, was actually profitable. Still, the
                          firm faced major competition from tech giants in the video chat space including Microsoft (MSFT),
                          Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Cisco (CSCO). Even Apple (AAPL) and Facebook (FB) offer video chat

                          low-income students and students of color. And even before COVID-19, 43 percent of parents reported
                          struggling to find an adequate child care facility for their children. President Biden is calling

                          public from outdated, inefficient, and sometimes unsafe working conditions. While the median age of

                          median age of 58. The President believes our veterans deserve state-of-the-art hospitals and care.
                          President Biden’s plan provides $18 billion for the modernization of Veterans Affairs hospitals and
                          clinics.

                          Nonetheless, the final was contested by two European teams.[68] In another World Cup first, the two
                          finalists from the preceding tournament, Italy and France, were eliminated at the group stage, with
                          Italy becoming the third defending champions to be eliminated in the first round after Brazil in
                          1966 and France in 2002.[76] New Zealand, one of the lowest-ranked teams, surprised many by drawing
                          all three of their group matches, ending the tournament as the only undefeated team. All times
                          listed are South African Standard Time (UTC+02) The knockout stage comprised the 16 teams that
                          advanced from the group stage of the tournament. There were four rounds of matches, with each round
                          eliminating half of the teams entering that round. The successive rounds were the round of 16,
                          quarter-finals, semi-finals, and the final. There was also a play-off to decide third and fourth
                          place. For each game in the knockout stage, any draw at 90 minutes was followed by thirty minutes
                          of extra time; if scores were still level, there was a penalty shootout to determine who progressed
                          to the next round.[82] In this round, each group winner (A-H) was paired against the runner-up from
                          another group. The round was marked by some controversial referees' decisions, including:

                          spent four decades working roadside to fund her children's education. The two sang a song together
                          on stage, which Cheboi said she grew up singing to her mom after she returned home from work,

                          Performing Arts will present the 24th Mark Twain Prize for American Humor to Adam Sandler on March
                          19, 2023 in the Kennedy Center Concert Hall. The Prize, which is named to honor one of the world’s
                          greatest humorists, will be awarded at a gala performance featuring some of the biggest names in
                          comedy. Broadcast details will be announced at a later date. The Mark Twain Prize for American
                          Humor recognizes individuals who have had an impact on American society in ways similar to the
                          distinguished 19th-century novelist and essayist Samuel Clemens, best known as Mark Twain. As a
                          social commentator, satirist, and creator of characters, Clemens was a fearless observer of
                          society, who startled many while delighting and informing many more with his uncompromising
                          perspective on social injustice and personal folly. “Adam Sandler has entertained audiences for
                          over three decades with his films, music, and his tenure as a fan favorite cast member on SNL,”
                          said Kennedy Center President Deborah F. Rutter about this year’s recipient. “Adam has created
                          characters that have made us laugh, cry, and cry from laughing. I am looking forward to a
                          laughter-filled evening like no other as we celebrate his career at a ceremony that is sure to
                          bring together the best in comedy.

                          Association (NCAA) today announced that Charlie Baker, the Governor of the Commonwealth of
                          Massachusetts, will serve as the next NCAA President, assuming the role effective March 2023. A
                          former collegiate athlete at Harvard, Governor Baker is credited with bringing bipartisan
                          leadership to the state, successfully guiding Massachusetts through an exceptionally turbulent
                          period for government officials. In addition to his two terms as Governor, he brings decades of

                          sectors. Governor Baker’s appointment marks the culmination of a comprehensive and inclusive
                          national search process, led by a subcommittee of the NCAA Board of Governors and TurnkeyZRG, the

                          Baker to the NCAA and eager for him to begin his work with our organization,” said Linda
                          Livingstone, President of Baylor University and Chair of the NCAA Board of Governors, who helmed
                          the presidential search committee. “Governor Baker has shown a remarkable ability to bridge divides
                          and build bipartisan consensus, taking on complex challenges in innovative and effective ways.

                          Association (NCAA) today announced that Charlie Baker, the Governor of the Commonwealth of
                          Massachusetts, will serve as the next NCAA President, assuming the role effective March 2023. A
                          former collegiate athlete at Harvard, Governor Baker is credited with bringing bipartisan
                          leadership to the state, successfully guiding Massachusetts through an exceptionally turbulent
                          period for government officials. In addition to his two terms as Governor, he brings decades of

                          sectors. Governor Baker’s appointment marks the culmination of a comprehensive and inclusive

                          executive, on Monday officially took over the CEO role at Twitter from Elon Musk, weeks after the
                          billionaire announced hiring her for the top spot at the social media company. “It happened — first
                          day in the books!,” Yaccarino tweeted late Monday. “Stay tuned…” A day earlier, Yaccarino had
                          tweeted that Twitter had hired Joe Benarroch, NBCU’s former senior vice president of communications
                          for advertising and partnerships, to join her at the company. Benarroch will work in business

                          said in the tweet. The New York Times and The Information first reported that Yaccarino was
                          expected to officially start as Twitter CEO on Monday. Twitter did not respond to a request for
                          comment. A new CEO won't fix Twitter's biggest problem Musk announced in May that Yaccarino,

                          media. Her strategy, she said, is to “have very good relationships with them so they become our
                          advocates or mouthpieces to amplify our strategies.” But Ms. Yaccarino also made it clear that she

                          NFT collection startup Yuga Labs’ new CEO, Daniel Alegre, has a tall task ahead of him at his new
                          gig: rallying momentum around thousands of digital ape jpegs and CryptoPunks that once sold for
                          millions—all while the crypto market is spiraling. A key part of Alegre’s plan is the continued
                          buildout of the Yuga Labs virtual world, Otherside, the CEO explained Wednesday at Fortune’s
                          Brainstorm Tech conference in Deer Valley, Utah. These metaverse plans, which have been ongoing
                          since Yuga’s virtual land sale in 2022, are “audacious” and will “take time,” said Alegre, who was
                          the former president and COO of video game company Activision Blizzard before joining Yuga Labs end
                          of last year. “As an NFT holder, you will be able to participate in drawing what we’re building,
                          which is this Otherside metaverse,” he said, without offering many more details. Since Yuga Labs’
                          land sale raised $320 million last year, token holders have had two brief “trips” into that virtual
                          world—short visits intended to show the community “what the evolution can be,” Alegre said. Yuga
                          Labs’ gave users their first visit to Otherside in the summer of 2022, and followed up with a
                          second trip about eight months later. But it remains unclear when the company plans to officially
                          open the doors to Otherside.

                          These allegations led to a lawsuit being filed by the California Department of Fair Employment and
                          Housing against Activision Blizzard in July 2021. The company has also faced criticism for its
                          handling of the situation and the toxic work environment that allegedly exists within the company.
                          This has resulted in significant public backlash, with some fans and employees calling for boycotts
                          and protests. Alegre’s departure from Activision to Yuga Labs may be seen as a positive move for
                          those who are critical of Activision’s leadership and culture. It’s worth noting that the gaming
                          industry and the NFT space have both been the subject of intense scrutiny and controversy in recent
                          years. The allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination at Activision Blizzard have been a
                          particularly significant source of controversy in the gaming industry. Meanwhile, the NFT space has
                          faced criticism for its environmental impact and the high levels of speculation and price
                          volatility surrounding some NFTs. Furthermore, the recent fake news surrounding Bored Ape Yacht
                          Club (BAYC) highlights the need for responsible and informed reporting in the NFT space. Given
                          these issues, the appointment of Alegre as Yuga Labs’ CEO marks an interesting new phase for the
                          company. As Yuga Labs continues to expand its presence in the NFT gaming space, it will be
                          important for the company to navigate these complex issues with transparency and responsibility.

                          took in $134 million at the US box office, giving director James Cameron his first $100 million
                          opening weekend — despite falling short of analyst predictions. Although notching the second
                          highest world-wide opening this year didn’t quite match expectations, the film’s ultimate success
                          will depend on its long term appeal, a notable attribute of many of Cameron’s movies. “Avatar: The
                          Way of Water” has so far earned $435 million at the global box office. 'Avatar: The Way of Water'
                          could be a 'life saver' for China's cinemas Though Cameron hasn’t revealed exactly how much it cost
                          to make the “Avatar” sequel, one answer isn’t in doubt: a lot. Or in Cameron’s own words to GQ
                          Magazine, “very f***ing expensive.” The star director estimated to industry executives that in
                          order to break even the movie has “to be the third or fourth highest-grossing film in history.”
                          That means it needs to make more than $2 billion. Earning nearly $3 billion, “Avatar” is the
                          highest-grossing film of all time. And only one film during the pandemic era, “Spider-Man: No Way
                          Home,” has even come close to that mark, raking in nearly $1.9 billion.

                          post-opening weekend sales are usually around 5%. For “The Way of Water,” they were at 20%. In
                          other words, the company knew that tracking was overinflated. “We’ve got a terrific movie that is
                          playing across all demographics and (has) terrific word of mouth,” said Tony Chambers, the Walt
                          Disney Co.’s executive vice president for theatrical distribution. “We’ve got the screens and we’ve

                          run.” The film began its international rollout on Wednesday and debuted in North America on
                          Thursday evening. Domestically, “Avatar: The Way of Water” was released in 4,202 theaters on over
                          12,000 screens, 400 of which were IMAX 3D. The studio and filmmakers bet big on the draw, and

                          Pinocchio" during the Oscars show at the 95th Academy Awards in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California,
                          U.S., March 12, 2023. REUTERS/Carlos Barria By Danielle Broadway LOS ANGELES, March 12 (Reuters) -
                          Mexican filmmaker Guillermo del Toro's "Pinocchio" won the Academy Award for best animated feature
                          film on Sunday, the third Oscar of his career. The haunting stop-motion musical fantasy was
                          inspired by the 1883 Italian novel "The Adventures of Pinocchio" by Carlo Collodi, and informed by
                          Gris Grimly's illustrations of the 2002 edition of the book. Del Toro, 58, reimagines the classic
                          story of Pinocchio, a wooden puppet who dreams of being a real boy, who is cared for by carver
                          Geppetto. However, the story of the Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) film is set in Fascist Italy during the
                          interwar period and World War Two. "Pinocchio" prevailed over other popular nominees A24's
                          stop-motion film "Marcel the Shell With Shoes On" and the Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) 3D animated film
                          "Turning Red." Del Toro has many accolades, including his 2018 Oscar wins for best picture and best
                          director for "The Shape of Water.

                          four and Alfonso Cuaron, who leads the group with five statuettes. In 2017, Del Toro won a pair of

                          direction, then migrating back to a more circular orbit and stretching out again in the other

                          be with us deep into the next century. There have been mini-moon false alarms in the recent past.

                          games. C.J. Stroud, however, will have success on the perimeter with Marvin Harrison Jr. and Emeka

                          which costs $3 per user per month billed annually and tops out at 10 GB of storage. To coincide
                          with the introduction of the new tier, Microsoft today announced the general availability of the
                          Microsoft 365 app, which replaces the Microsoft Office app with a new design and new features. As
                          previewed earlier this year during Microsoft’s Ignite conference, the Microsoft 365 app — now live
                          on the web — provides quick access to apps including Word, Excel and PowerPoint in addition to file
                          templates, “smart” recommendations, to-do list functionality and syncing across different devices.
                          The Microsoft 365 app will launch on Windows, Android and iOS later this month, Microsoft says.
                          Rounding out the raft of new apps and services, Microsoft 365 users will soon be able to view,
                          manage and upgrade cloud storage across devices via a new “simplified view,” says the company.
                          Starting February 1 from a Microsoft account, Windows settings or app settings, subscribers can
                          mange and upgrade their cloud file and photo storage. The investment in Microsoft 365 makes sense.
                          It is a growing revenue item for Microsoft, which has bet much of its future on the cloud and, by
                          extension, cloud-driven subscriptions. In its Q4 2022 earnings call, Microsoft reported that
                          Microsoft 365 Consumer subscribers grew 15% to 59.

                          It’s more of a shift in focus where we’re doubling down on Microsoft 365 as our productivity suite,
                          and we want people, when they think of productivity, to think about Microsoft 365 and not Office.”
                          Later this month will also mark 10 years since Microsoft first introduced consumer subscriptions
                          for Office. Known back then as Office 365 Home Premium, the plan included access to Office desktop
                          apps and 20GB of cloud storage. That’s been increased to 1TB of cloud storage these days, alongside
                          a bunch of features added to the subscription. “One thing hasn’t changed over the last 10 years:
                          the price,” writes Microsoft vice president Liat Ben-Zur in a blog post. “Microsoft 365 Personal
                          and Family still cost only $6.99 and $9.99 per month, respectively.” While inflation and costs have
                          been pushing up other subscription services over the past decade, Microsoft says it doesn’t have
                          any immediate plans to raise Microsoft 365 prices, but Oystryk doesn’t rule it out for the future.

                          movie(s) is described as an epic sci-fi adventure compared with Star Wars in scope and scale.
                          Here’s an updated look at what we can expect from Rebel Moon which is now confirmed to arrive on
                          Netflix in December 2023. Zack Snyder will direct and co-write the film and will reunite with many
                          of his colleagues from past projects. The script for Rebel Moon will be co-written by Shay Hatten,
                          who co-wrote Army of the Dead, and Kurt Johnstad, who worked on 300 with Snyder. The Stone Quarry
                          is the main production company behind the movie with Grand Electric also listed, which is Eric
                          Newman’s production company that has an overall deal with Netflix. Snyder commented on the
                          inspiration for Rebel Moon in his THR interview: “This is me growing up as an Akira Kurosawa fan, a
                          Star Wars fan. It’s my love of sci-fi and a giant adventure.” @Netflix Let's go! https://t.

                          warriors from across the galaxy to make a stand against the Mother World's forces before they
                          return to the planet.

                          The decrease in residential fixed investment mainly reflected a decrease in new single-family
                          construction as well as brokers' commissions. The decrease in federal government spending reflected
                          decreases in both defense and nondefense spending. Within imports, both goods (led by nonautomotive
                          capital goods) and services (led by travel) increased. Current-dollar GDP increased 9.2 percent, or
                          $2.15 trillion, in 2022 to a level of $25.46 trillion, compared with an increase of 10.7 percent,
                          or $2.25 trillion, in 2021 (tables 1 and 3). The price index for gross domestic purchases increased
                          6.8 percent in 2022, compared with an increase of 4.2 percent in 2021 (table 4). The PCE price
                          index increased 6.2 percent, compared with an increase of 4.0 percent. Excluding food and energy
                          prices, the PCE price index increased 5.0 percent, compared with an increase of 3.5 percent.
                          Measured from the fourth quarter of 2021 to the fourth quarter of 2022, real GDP increased 1.0
                          percent during the period (table 5), compared with an increase of 5.7 percent from the fourth

                          TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew will testify for his first congressional hearing on Thursday, where he is
                          likely to face intense grilling from politicians from both parties who argue that the popular app,
                          which has 150 million U.S. users, cannot be trusted. Here’s a quick guide for what to know about
                          Chew, a 40-year-old Singaporean who interned at Facebook and studied at Harvard Business School
                          before becoming the public face of one of the most popular — and contentious — apps in the United
                          States. TikTok's CEO testifies before Congress. Follow our live updates. Chew was born and raised
                          in Singapore, the island nation in Southeast Asia that has become a prominent bridge for
                          international business between China and the West. “The thing about growing up on a small island …
                          is you get wanderlust at a very young age,” he said in an interview last year. After completing his
                          military service — mandatory for most male Singaporeans — he left to study economics at University
                          College London (UCL), a top British university, graduating in 2006 and working at investment bank
                          Goldman Sachs for two years. He then moved to the United States to get his master’s degree at
                          Harvard Business School. “I remember struggling with this decision,” he said in a speech to UCL
                          graduates in 2022, as he was unsure whether taking time to do the master’s degree “would enhance or
                          delay my career.

                          Shou Zi Chew testified Thursday at a congressional hearing over concerns about user data collected
                          by the popular video-sharing app and potential Chinese spying. Under his helm, TikTok reached 150
                          million users in the U.S., the majority of them teens and young adults who are attracted to the
                          app’s simple interface and addictive algorithm that serves up short videos on just about any
                          imaginable topic. Lawmakers have said they’re worried about American data falling into the hands of
                          the Chinese government and claim it threatens national security and user privacy and could be used
                          to promote pro-Beijing propaganda and misinformation. Chew attempted to persuade lawmakers not to
                          pursue a ban on the app or force Chinese parent company ByteDance to give up its ownership stake,
                          testifying that TikTok prioritizes the safety of young users. He says the company plans to store
                          all U.S. user data on servers maintained and owned by the software giant Oracle. Here’s a closer
                          look at Chew: Chew, 40, is a native of Singapore, where he lives with his wife, Vivian Kao, and
                          their two children. He graduated in 2006 from University College London and worked for two years at
                          Goldman Sachs before moving to the U.S. to pursue a master’s degree at Harvard Business School.

                          call it that – of four characters, Larry, Fred, Yvonne and Kakler, who look like what would happen
                          if Jerry, George, Elaine and Kramer were sucked into a 1990s computer game. They spend their days
                          discussing their lives and other trivial matters. And it never, ever stops: log on at any hour and
                          there they are, talking about coffee quality or a difficult Monopoly game. The dialogue comes from

                          Another example is Jerry's girlfriend Vanessa, who appears in "The Stake Out" and with whom he ends
                          the relationship when things do not work out in "The Stock Tip". Other examples are Kramer getting
                          his jacket back and Elaine heading the "Peterman catalog". Larry David, the head writer and
                          executive producer for the first seven seasons, was praised for keeping a close eye on minor
                          details and making sure the main characters' lives remained consistent and believable. Curb Your
                          Enthusiasm, David's later comedy series, expanded on this idea by following a specific theme for
                          all but one season in the series. A major difference between Seinfeld and sitcoms that preceded it
                          is that the principal characters never learn from their mistakes. In effect, they are indifferent
                          and even callous toward the outside world and sometimes one another. A mantra of the show's
                          producers was "No hugging, no learning."[52] Entertainment Weekly's TV critic Ken Tucker has
                          described them as "a group dynamic rooted in jealousy, rage, insecurity, despair, hopelessness, and
                          a touching lack of faith in one's fellow human beings."[53] This leads to very few happy endings,
                          except at somebody else's expense. More often in every episode, situations resolve with characters
                          getting a justly deserved comeuppance. The show premiered as The Seinfeld Chronicles on July 5,
                          1989. After it aired, a pickup by NBC seemed unlikely and the show was offered to Fox, which
                          declined to pick it up.

                          if Jerry, George, Elaine and Kramer were sucked into a 1990s computer game. They spend their days
                          discussing their lives and other trivial matters. And it never, ever stops: log on at any hour and
                          there they are, talking about coffee quality or a difficult Monopoly game. The dialogue comes from
                          OpenAI’s GPT-3, a text generator closely related to the ChatGPT service that has recently made
                          waves; another company is responsible for the tech behind the speech itself. On top of that, “we
                          have a lot of proprietary generative algorithms that cause the show to be ‘formed’, so to be
                          speak,” Skyler Hartle of Mismatch Media told Polygon. “We collectively call this logic the
                          ‘director’, as it is largely responsible for making sure all the individual pieces come together
                          into a whole.

Question 247              : What is the voucher amount per student in the Students First Act?
Correct Answers         :

                          This bill is about where that family feels that child will be best taught. This bill is not about
                          attacking teachers. The opponents of this bill will state that we’re attacking teachers over and
                          over again tonight. Nothing could be further from the truth." More:How will Gov. Kim Reynolds'
                          private school scholarships plan work? Here are the details Opponents in both chambers hammered
                          Republicans over the legislation, arguing it would harm public education while unfairly benefitting
                          private schools that lack accountability and can pick and choose which students they will accept.
                          “Spending public money with no accountability is reckless. Our public schools and students deserve
                          better,” said Sen. Molly Donahue, D-Cedar Rapids. “Until we are willing to provide adequate funding
                          for the vast majority of our public school students, we should not be creating a private, exclusive
                          school entitlement program with unknown costs and unlimited funding — a blank check.” The bill,
                          House File 68, would phase in over three years and eventually allow all Iowa families to use up to
                          $7,598 a year in an "education savings account" for private school tuition. If any money is left
                          over after tuition and fees, families could use the funds for specific educational expenses,
                          including textbooks, tutoring, standardized testing fees, online education programs and vocational
                          and life skills training. The $7,598 per private school student is the same amount of funding the
                          state provides to public school students and is expected to rise in future years.

                          CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa (KCRG) - The number of Iowans applying for an Educational Savings Account under
                          Iowa’s new school voucher program has surpassed projections, raising questions on the costs to
                          state taxpayers and local school districts. As of Friday, the Iowa Department of Education says it
                          has received 15,538 applications for an Educational Savings Account, or ESA, to provide state
                          funding for a student to attend a private K-12 school. A Legislative Services Agency analysis
                          projected 14,068 would enroll in the first year of the program. The application period runs through
                          June 30th, meaning the number of applications will likely continue to grow. If all of those
                          applications are approved, the taxpayer cost for the program would likely exceed the $107 million
                          dollars estimate for this coming school year. It would also likely mean a larger-than-expected loss
                          in funding to public schools due to students enrolling instead in a private institution. State
                          funding to public schools is based on enrollment, so fewer enrolled students would mean less
                          funding from the state. Governor Reynolds’ voucher program aimed to offset at least some of that by
                          giving districts $1,176 per student who lives in a district and enrolls in a private school. The
                          state declined to provide demographic data on the applications so far, citing the ongoing
                          application period. That means it’s unclear yet how many of the applications are from public school
                          students.

                          similar chatbot to its Bing internet search engine, showing how the technology could shift the
                          market that Google has dominated for more than 20 years. Google has been racing to ship A.I.
                          products since December. It declared a “code red” in response to ChatGPT’s release, making A.I. the
                          company’s central priority.

Question 250              : who founded midjourney?

                          Rob Salkowitz, Forbes Contributor: What’s your role and title? David Holz, Midjourney. I'm the
                          founder and CEO. I usually just prefer being called the founder, though, because CEO sounds very
                          businessy, and we're not very businessy. We're an applied research lab that makes products. What is
                          Midjourney’s mission? We like to say we’re trying to expand the imaginative powers of the human
                          species. The goal is to make humans more imaginative, not make imaginative machines, which I think
                          is an important distinction. Can you give a brief history of the company to date? We started
                          working on the imagination part of our company about a year and a half ago. There were some
                          breakthroughs on diffusion models, people understanding clip, openAI, that sort of thing. Almost
                          everyone involved in this is San Francisco and we all realized this is going to get serious, that
                          it’s different from a lot of other stuff. What does Midjourney see as the benefit of this
                          text-to-image technology for business and society? I’m definitely more concerned about society than
                          business. We’re a consumer product, but maybe 30%-50% of our users right now are professionals. The
                          majority are not. Artists on the platform tell us it allows them to be more creative and
                          explorative in the beginning, coming up with a lot of ideas in a short amount of time. Right now,
                          our professional users are using the platform for concepting.

                          “Coming from the IA [intelligence augmentation] school of thought, I’ve always been more interested
                          in empowering people and trying to make people better.” Like many experts in AI who believe in
                          using machines to perform tasks that humans would consider intelligent or smart —and experts in IA,
                          who place humans at the center of the system and use technology to support and complement human
                          cognitive functions, Holz chose a path that would let him enjoy the best of both worlds. “Over the
                          years, I’ve realized that we can use AI to empower people and to make people better and those
                          people can make better AI — it’s like coming full circle and everyone wins,” he said. Leap Motion
                          transpired out of this ideology. The company developed an optical hand tracking module that
                          captures the movements of human hands using AI. “The goal wasn’t to replace a sign language person,
                          but it was to allow us to literally be embodied in virtual spaces inside of computers. And now,
                          with Midjourney, we are not trying to replace an artist but are giving them tools to explore new
                          mediums of thought and expand their imaginative powers,” Holz explained. In 2021, Holz started
                          Midjourney as an independent research lab. Around the same time, industry buzzwords like ‘diffusion
                          models’ and ‘contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP)’ were on everyone’s lips. Building on
                          these developments, the lab began offering its text-to-image service in 2022.

                          Pikmin 4 is so close to lanching on the Nintendo Switch, and here's when fans can expect to jump
                          into the digital version. Pikmin 4 is set to launch for the Nintendo Switch on July 21 and marks
                          the newest numbered entry in the real-time strategy series in over ten years, making its release
                          quite the big deal for hardcore fans. Instead of playing as Captain Olimar (who most people know
                          from Super Smash Bros. at this point) or any of his space explorer comrades, gamers will get to
                          customize their own character (a series first). There are not too many options available, but it's
                          still a step forward in terms of a character creator in a Nintendo first-party title. Pikmin 4
                          comes out in a couple of days and retails for $59.99, the same price as most other major games on
                          the Switch. People who decided to pre-order the game digitally via the Switch eShop are probably
                          wondering just when they'll be able to actually boot the game and start playing --that's where this
                          guide comes into play. RELATED: Pikmin 4 Fans Are Paying for Ads of the Game to Appear Over Time
                          Square Before we get into it, it's worth pointing out that this is the expected release time for
                          Pikmin 4 --it has not been officially confirmed by Nintendo just yet.

                          Pikmin 4 is so close to lanching on the Nintendo Switch, and here's when fans can expect to jump
                          into the digital version. Pikmin 4 is set to launch for the Nintendo Switch on July 21 and marks
                          the newest numbered entry in the real-time strategy series in over ten years, making its release
                          quite the big deal for hardcore fans. Instead of playing as Captain Olimar (who most people know
                          from Super Smash Bros. at this point) or any of his space explorer comrades, gamers will get to
                          customize their own character (a series first). There are not too many options available, but it's
                          still a step forward in terms of a character creator in a Nintendo first-party title. Pikmin 4
                          comes out in a couple of days and retails for $59.99, the same price as most other major games on
                          the Switch. People who decided to pre-order the game digitally via the Switch eShop are probably
                          wondering just when they'll be able to actually boot the game and start playing --that's where this
                          guide comes into play. RELATED: Pikmin 4 Fans Are Paying for Ads of the Game to Appear Over Time
                          Square Before we get into it, it's worth pointing out that this is the expected release time for
                          Pikmin 4 --it has not been officially confirmed by Nintendo just yet.

                          necessarily know the denominator. At the end of the year, Meta had roughly 86,000 employees. Most
                          of those who are being laid off - the 11,000 from last fall - were still on the payroll, the
                          company said.

                          The company’s headcount ballooned during the pandemic from 48,000 on March 31, 2020 to 87,000
                          before layoffs started in November. “We should prepare ourselves for the possibility that this new
                          economic reality will continue for many years.” During Meta’s last earnings call in February,
                          Zuckerberg declared this the “year of efficiency,” even as he continues to spend billions to build
                          out his vision of the metaverse. Since November’s layoffs, he has been focused on reducing layers
                          of management, telling employees in January, “I don’t think you want a management structure that’s
                          just managers managing managers, managing managers, managing managers, managing the people who are
                          doing the work.” In his memo announcing more layoffs, Zuckerberg said that it no longer makes sense
                          for managers to have only “a few” direct reports and confirmed that many of them will be asked to
                          become individual contributors throughout the company. “A leaner org will execute its highest
                          priorities faster,” he wrote. “People will be more productive, and their work will be more fun and
                          fulfilling.” He said Meta will continue canceling low-priority projects throughout the company and
                          that he had “underestimated the indirect costs” of running them. Just yesterday, Meta said it would
                          end work to facilitate the sharing of NFTs on Facebook and Instagram, and a standalone product
                          group for creating new social apps called New Product Experimentation was quietly canned last week.

  - Source              :
                          Here’s a breakdown of the playoff overtime rules: Carl Cheffers, an NFL official since 2000, will
                          be the referee for Super Bowl LVII. The Whittier native has refereed two Super Bowls, the first in
                          2017 when Tom Brady and the New England Patriots defeated the Atlanta Falcons in overtime of Super
                          Bowl LI. His last Super Bowl assignment was in 2021 when the Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers
                          defeated the Kansas City Chiefs. Cheffers, 62, and his crews ranked No. 1 in the league for
                          penalties called during the 2022 regular season, averaging 14.4 flags per game, according to
                          Profootballreference.com. During Super Bowl LV, Cheffers drew the ire of many Chiefs fans for eight
                          first-half penalties against Kansas City. The Chiefs lost 95 yards in the game because of penalties
                          — a Super Bowl record. Here’s who will make up the rest of Cheffers’ Super Bowl LVII officiating
                          crew: Roy Ellison (umpire), Jerod Phillips (down judge), Jeff Bergman (line judge), John Jenkins
                          (field judge), Eugene Hall (side judge), Dino Paganelli (back judge), Mark Butterworth (replay

                          billion at the American and Canadian box offices at the time. Top Gun: Maverick was the
                          highest-grossing film among the Best Picture nominees with $718.7 million in domestic box office
                          receipts.[38] Avatar: The Way of Water came in second with $598.4 million; this was followed by

                          unavailable due to their distributor Netflix's policy of refusing to release such figures.[39]
                          Furthermore, by virtue of Avatar: The Way of Water and Top Gun: Maverick's Best Picture
                          nominations, it marked the first time since the 55th ceremony in 1983 that the two highest grossing

                          On the morning of the ceremony, however, it was reported that Gaga would perform at the
                          ceremony.[36] Meanwhile, actress Glenn Close, who was originally scheduled as a presenter during
                          the gala, canceled her appearance due to a positive COVID-19 test.[37] When the nominations were
                          announced, nine of the ten films nominated for Best Picture had earned a combined gross of $1.57
                          billion at the American and Canadian box offices at the time. Top Gun: Maverick was the
                          highest-grossing film among the Best Picture nominees with $718.7 million in domestic box office
                          receipts.[38] Avatar: The Way of Water came in second with $598.4 million; this was followed by
                          Elvis ($151 million), Everything Everywhere All at Once ($70 million), The Fabelmans ($15 million),
                          The Banshees of Inisherin ($9 million), Tar ($5.6 million), Triangle of Sadness ($4.2 million), and
                          Women Talking ($1.1 million). The box office figures for All Quiet on the Western Front were
                          unavailable due to their distributor Netflix's policy of refusing to release such figures.[39]
                          Furthermore, by virtue of Avatar: The Way of Water and Top Gun: Maverick's Best Picture
                          nominations, it marked the first time since the 55th ceremony in 1983 that the two highest grossing
                          films of the year were both nominated in the aforementioned category.[40]

                          The twenty-third season of the American reality television series The Voice premiered on March 6,
                          2023, on NBC.[1][2] The season is presented by Carson Daly, who returned for his twenty-third
                          season as host. The panel of coaches for the season consists of Blake Shelton, who returned for his
                          twenty-third and final season as a coach; returning coach Kelly Clarkson, who returned for her
                          ninth season after a one-season hiatus; and debuting coaches Chance the Rapper and Niall Horan.[3]
                          Gina Miles was named as the winner of the season, with the closest margin to-date, on the season
                          finale that aired on May 23, 2023. Her victory marks Niall Horan's first win as a coach, with Horan
                          becoming the third new coach, after Clarkson and John Legend, to win on his debut season, as well
                          as the youngest coach to win a season. On October 11, 2022, NBC announced that the show would be
                          returning for a twenty-third season to be aired in spring 2023.[4][5] Previously, it was announced
                          that, beginning with the 2021–22 United States network television schedule, only one season would
                          be produced per cyclical year,[6] though it was reported that this decision was reversed upon the
                          announcement of the season.[7] Later, it was announced that the season would air on March 6.

                          Elon Musk wants to “understand the true nature of the universe.” At least that’s what his new AI
                          company, xAI, said on its website as he announced its formation on Wednesday. Musk incorporated xAI
                          in Nevada in March this year and reportedly purchased “roughly 10,000 graphics processing
                          units”—hardware that is required to develop and run state-of-the-art AI systems. The company has
                          not said how it is financed but the Financial Times reported in April that Musk was discussing
                          getting funding from investors in SpaceX and Tesla, two companies he runs. The company has not
                          shared much detail about its intentions, but said on its website that its team would be joining a
                          Twitter Spaces call on July 14 to take questions. (Musk is the owner of Twitter.) The AI company
                          will work closely with Twitter, now called X Corp., and Tesla, as well as other companies “to make
                          progress towards our mission,” xAI said on its website. The team at xAI, led by Musk, includes
                          former employees of prominent AI companies OpenAI and DeepMind, as well as Microsoft and Tesla. Dan
                          Hendrycks, director of the Center for AI Safety, is listed as an adviser. The Center for AI Safety
                          has been highly vocal about safety concerns.

                          was dissolved as a company this week and was replaced by a new company Musk calls X. The move is
                          seen as an attempt to build a social media platform that also allows payments, turning it into “the
                          everything app,” akin to how apps like WeChat work in China. Twitter announced this week it was
                          partnering with eToro to allow users to be able to trade stocks and crypto. It should be pretty
                          clear by now that Musk’s call for a six-month pause was purely out of self interest in the AI arms
                          race, as I wrote at the time. ChatGPT has become a fascinating tool for people who want to
                          experiment with large language models (LLMs) that answer questions posed in natural language. But
                          there are still a lot of kinks to be worked out, as ChatGPT will often give confident answers, even
                          when it’s wrong. AI is largely a magic trick at this point, sometimes spouting nonsense that users
                          may not know enough about to fact-check. But it’s an interesting magic trick and it’s something
                          that will improved upon as more people in the world of tech become involved. Musk must know he’s
                          behind in the most exciting development on the web since social media went mainstream in the late
                          2000s. But the billionaire clearly doesn’t intend to stay behind for long.

                          Elon Musk wants to “understand the true nature of the universe.” At least that’s what his new AI
                          company, xAI, said on its website as he announced its formation on Wednesday. Musk incorporated xAI
                          in Nevada in March this year and reportedly purchased “roughly 10,000 graphics processing
                          units”—hardware that is required to develop and run state-of-the-art AI systems. The company has
                          not said how it is financed but the Financial Times reported in April that Musk was discussing
                          getting funding from investors in SpaceX and Tesla, two companies he runs. The company has not
                          shared much detail about its intentions, but said on its website that its team would be joining a
                          Twitter Spaces call on July 14 to take questions. (Musk is the owner of Twitter.) The AI company
                          will work closely with Twitter, now called X Corp., and Tesla, as well as other companies “to make
                          progress towards our mission,” xAI said on its website. The team at xAI, led by Musk, includes
                          former employees of prominent AI companies OpenAI and DeepMind, as well as Microsoft and Tesla. Dan
                          Hendrycks, director of the Center for AI Safety, is listed as an adviser. The Center for AI Safety
                          has been highly vocal about safety concerns.

                          Filed under: It’s the middle of April, the big Hokie Hi weekend has passed, and the biggest of the
                          big campus celebration events was the Spring Football Game. There were lots of things to look at
                          and analyze but for now, here are some shots and comments from the game. GO HOKIES!!! The crowd was
                          easily over 20,000 people. Hokie Hi weekend featured Friday and Saturday celebrations with an
                          evening tribute to the fallen 32 from April 16th 2007. The morning on Saturday was the 3.2 mile Run
                          and Walk for Remembrance, and the crowd there was estimated to be 15,000 or so. The weather in
                          Blacksburg not only cooperated, it assisted by being comfortably warm, without being hot, and a
                          light breeze was blowing. It was a magnificent way to honor the fallen and celebrate their memories
                          as Hokies. The Maroon Squad Offense was obviously mostly #1s int he depth chart, with Grant Wells
                          starting at Maroon Squad QB. He’d remain there for the first half. We’ll talk about the various
                          observations in a coming article, but overall, he did well and seemed like he was much more
                          comfortable than he was last season. We’ll take that as a major plus, for now.

                          State chiefs recognize that setting clear expectations for academic excellence is critical for
                          student success For all to mean all, it has to mean each. CCSSO supports states in encouraging
                          innovation, learning from other sectors, and applying new principles to transform the educational
                          landscape. As the national voice of every state education leader, we advocate for the development
                          and implementation of effective policies. Published: Author: Washington, D.C. (April 19, 2023) –
                          The Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO) today announced that Rebecka Peterson, a high
                          school math teacher, is the 2023 National Teacher of the Year. Peterson has taught high school math
                          classes ranging from intermediate algebra to Advanced Placement calculus for 11 years at Union High
                          School in Tulsa, Oklahoma. A proud immigrant of Swedish-Iranian descent, Peterson is passionate
                          about making mathematics engaging, relevant and accessible to all students, no matter their
                          background. Amid a difficult first year of high school teaching, she found “One Good Thing,” a
                          collaborative blog for teachers to track the good things happening in their classrooms. She credits
                          daily posting there to helping her recognize the beautiful and positive experiences occurring in
                          her classroom, which inspired her to stay in the profession. She has since contributed 1,400 posts
                          to the blog. As Oklahoma Teacher of the Year, she has visited teachers across the state to
                          highlight their important work through the Teachers of Oklahoma campaign.

                          [79] CNET has reported that the "Apple retail experience hurts Best Buy" and noted, "Buy a MacBook
                          at the Apple Store and it's hard to go back to the Best Buy Windows laptop buying experience". The
                          publication also wrote that "Apple salespeople are generally more knowledgeable, the products
                          themselves are generally higher quality, and the stores are more appealing, aesthetically and
                          practically."[80] In October 2009, reports surfaced that Steve Jobs and his retail team would help
                          "drastically overhaul" Disney Stores. His involvement was described by The New York Times as
                          "particularly notable", given his work on the "highly successful" Apple Stores and his election to
                          Disney's board of directors in 2006.[81][82] In August 2009, the London Evening Standard reported
                          that Apple's first store in the United Kingdom, at Regent Street, was the most profitable shop of
                          its size in London, with the highest sales per square foot, taking in £60 million a year, or £2,000
                          per square foot.[83] Many other electronics retailers from around the world such as Huawei,
                          Samsung, Xiaomi started to follow the designing trend of Apple Store.[citation needed] In May 2016,
                          Apple significantly redesigned its Union Square Apple Store in downtown San Francisco, adding large
                          glass doors for the entry, open spaces with touch-sensitive tables and shelves for product
                          displays, and rebranded rooms for the store.

Question 275              : What was Sundar Pichai's total compensation in 2022?

  - Source              :
                          The pay package awarded to Alphabet Inc. Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai soared to $226
                          million in 2022, boosted by a triennial stock grant, making him one of the world’s highest-paid
                          corporate leaders. The stock award portion of his pay amounted to $218 million, according to a
                          filing from the Google parent company Friday. He received a total of $6.3 million in compensation
                          in 2021, when he didn’t receive the grant, and his salary has remained steady at $2 million the
                          past three years. The 50-year-old CEO has been navigating a more competitive industry, with AI
                          products such as the chatbot ChatGPT from startup OpenAI threatening to undermine Google’s
                          dominance in search. A broader tech slowdown also has taken a toll on the company, with its shares
                          sliding 39% in 2022. Still, they’ve mounted a comeback in 2023, rising 19%. Pichai’s stock award
                          comes on a three-year schedule, and he received a similarly sized package in 2019. That year, the
                          executive was awarded $281 million. CEO compensation has become a particular touchy topic in the
                          technology industry — especially after a wave of layoffs at Alphabet and other major companies.
                          Apple Inc. CEO Tim Cook slashed his 2023 pay after drawing ire for making $100 million each of the
                          past two years.

                          personal security. Difficult time? The news comes as Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL) initiates cost
                          restructuring measures, including layoffs of 12,000 workers, or 6% of workforce. Pichai even said
                          in January that top executives would get lower bonuses as part of cost-cutting measures. In
                          December, the company granted a new triannual equity award to Pichai with a value of $210M. In
                          2019, the last year his compensation included a triannual stock grant, his compensation was valued
                          at $281M. Have a tip? Submit confidentially to our News team. Found a factual error? Report here.

                          she wrote "Prima Facie" (a legal term that means self-evident) to highlight just how much the
                          British and American justice systems fail women who bring sexual assault cases. "The statistics
                          speak for themselves," Miller said. "One in 10 women actually reports a sexual assault. Out of
                          those, I think it's one in 10 that go to court. And out of those, there's a 1.3% conviction rate.

                          Dating apps, meanwhile, still require a level of manual work (swiping, messaging, responding) that
                          can become cumbersome and exhausting. That is what drove Dmitri Mirakyan, 28, a data scientist in
                          New York, to develop YourMove.ai, an AI dating tool that helps users begin and respond to messages.
                          “This past summer, I got really tired of sifting through and trying to come up with responses on
                          dating apps,” he said. “So I tried to see if GPT3 could flirt. It turns out it could. A month
                          later, I built the first version [of the platform] on a Saturday.” Unlike Rizz and a similar app
                          called Keys, Your Move does not yet plug into a user’s keyboard, and you must enter messages
                          manually and it will generate a response. However, Mirakyan says a keyboard update is coming soon.
                          Mirakyan said that he has always struggled with social interaction and reading social cues, and
                          that he built the app for those like him who need help making digital communication seamless.
                          “There’s such a gap currently in what people like myself want to communicate and how it comes
                          across,” he said. “Just trying to be honest or communicate a point [can mean] not reading the room
                          or stumbling over ourselves.” Users across the country are embracing the app’s ability to generate

                          Mirakyan's interest in an app like his, however, seems to go deeper than Lloyd's term paper
                          comparison. Speaking to WaPo, he explained that he's always had a difficult time reading social
                          cues — a dating stressor that a tool like YourMove.ai helps to alleviate. "There's such a gap
                          currently," he told the newspaper, "in what people like myself want to communicate and how it comes
                          across." That's sympathetic, in a sense, and we could see how AI assistance might benefit folks who
                          have a tough time socially. At the same time, however, balance is definitely still needed here.
                          Romance is one of the most human things out there, and the digital dating world is robotic enough
                          as it is. Do we really want everyone on the apps just passing AI-generated quips and complements
                          back and forth for eternity? That's starting to sound like The Sims — and as humans, maybe we
                          should shoot a little higher. More on post-AI online dating: Man "Sure" His AI Girlfriend Will save

                          much about it yet. New U.S. Soccer Federation’s sporting director Matt Crocker clearly knows a lot
                          about how to build good soccer teams over a long term. He did it in the club realm with the English
                          Premier League’s Southampton, and in the national team realm with English men’s and women’s youth
                          squads. “Matt has great experience in developing talent, implementing a clear and consistent
                          playing philosophy from youth to senior teams, and implementing coaching programming,” federation
                          president Cindy Cone said Tuesday as she introduced him to the media. “After spending some time
                          with Matt, it quickly became clear that he excels in communication as well as being a team builder.
                          He is driven, he’s creative, and committed to building relationships at every level of the game.”
                          Crocker, who succeeds Earnie Stewart in the role, also isn’t entirely new to America. Seated
                          between Cone and CEO JT Batson, the Welshman noted that back in the day, he spent summers coaching
                          kids in Kansas and Arkansas. And he was honest about having “no illusions of what I need to learn,
                          and I need to learn quickly.” But in one especially important area, it seems he has a lot of
                          learning to do.

                          join Eredivisie club PSV Eindhoven, the federation announced Thursday. Additionally, U.S. men’s
                          national team general manager Brian McBride is moving on after three years in his role. Here’s what
                          you need to know: U.S. Soccer hired Stewart in 2018 as the USMNT’s first general manager, and he
                          led the hiring search that resulted in Berhalter becoming the national team’s coach. Once Stewart
                          was promoted to sporting director, he helped hire McBride to take over as GM. The departures of
                          Stewart and McBride leave the USMNT with a completely blank slate. The USMNT now has no head coach,
                          no general manager and no sporting director overseeing the program. That’s a daunting position, but
                          it also presents a huge opportunity for the federation ahead of the 2026 World Cup that the U.S.
                          will co-host with Canada and Mexico. Advertisement “I know this moment feels a bit uncertain,” USSF

                          best known as the voice of Alpha 5 in Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers. Perfectly cast as the cartoony
                          character Turgle in Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, Horvitz's zany performance gives levity to a game
                          that can be heavy and have a darker tone. Turgle can be found on the planet of Koboh and, without
                          giving too much away, players will end up feeling one way or another about Turgle in their
                          playthrough.

                          It’s currently on a hiatus and it’s also hard to say when the new season will come back to the NBC
                          as the premiere date hasn’t even yet been confirmed yet online. We’re hopeful that Grand Crew
                          season 2 is currently shooting and the premiere date will be sometime in early 2023. Its regular
                          time slot is 8:30 p.m. EST on Tuesdays. The show might have to compete with upcoming pilots who
                          might compete for its time slot. With that being said, hopefully there isn’t a drastic last-minute
                          change to the 2022-2023 lineup. Other shows to watch out for include American Auto, Young Rock,
                          Quantam Leap, La Brea, and New Amsterdam. And for those of you who haven’t met the crew yet, what

                          the characters were left with some pretty major cliffhangers that could mean big changes in the
                          future — so what exactly happened? Keep reading on for an official recap of the Grand Crew Season 2
                          finale. In "Wine & Journals," we learned that following the directive of his therapist, Noah (Echo
                          Kellum) began keeping a personal journal. And by the finale, he tells Sherm (Carl Tart) that it's
                          begun to turn into a screenplay rather than a typical diary. At the end of the episode, we see that
                          he's printed it out with the title, A Hopeless Romantic...and the Friends That Gave Him Hope. Could
                          Noah be on the road to getting a book deal and becoming a published author? Towards the end of the
                          season Wyatt (Justin Cunningham) and Kristen (Maya Lynn Robinson) took in his young niece-cousin,
                          Nadine, when her mother was going through a hard time.

                          It marked the largest bank failure since the 2008 financial crisis. "As we look at the overall US
                          banking system, this is a strong [system], this is a safe [system], this is the envy of the world,"
                          Citi CEO Jane Fraser said on Yahoo Finance Live. Despite the banking turmoil, the S&P 500 is down
                          less than 1% in the past month. It's up roughly 6% on the year. But the negatives for markets are
                          becoming too hard to ignore for Koch and the other realists that Yahoo Finance chatted up at the
                          Milken Conference. Koch believes the economy is headed into a credit crunch, in part fueled by the
                          rolling banking crisis that continues to unfold. As that lending plays out, Koch thinks it could
                          begin to weigh on the commercial real estate market. "[Regional banks] have this dual pressure from
                          both deposit outflow and their commercial real estate exposure, and that's going to put pressure on
                          those banks," she explained. "It's going to put pressure on their ability to extend credit, which
                          in turn is going to put pressure on the economy and jobs. We are quite worried about that, and that
                          really underscores the base view as to why we're in the more bearish camp." Brian Sozzi is Yahoo

                          For charging, the Pixel Fold supports 21W wired speeds. However, you’ll have to purchase Google’s
                          30W power adapter ($25 at Google Store) separately. The phone also supports wireless charging at up
                          to 7.5W and will work with any Qi wireless charger. No. Furthermore, the Google Pixel does not
                          support pen/stylus input. The Pixel Fold’s inner display is protected by Ultra Thin Glass, complete
                          with a protective plastic layer applied. Gorilla Glass Victus protects the external display. Yes.
                          The Google Pixel Fold has an IPX8 certification, which means it can be submerged in up to 1.5
                          meters of freshwater for up to 30 minutes. No, Google no longer includes chargers with its
                          smartphones. You’ll have to buy a compatible charger that supports USB Power Delivery PPS. The
                          Google Pixel Fold supports dual SIMs. One is a nano-SIM slot, and the second is via eSIM. The Pixel
                          Fold was announced on May 10, 2023. General availability of the phone will commence in June 2023.
                          Folding phones are great for those who want a large-screen device but don’t want the size penalty
                          of carrying a tablet. Based on our hands-on experience, the Pixel Fold should also be a great
                          traditional handset when folded. There’s no indication that Google is working on a second, smaller
                          flip phone to partner the Pixel Fold or challenge the Galaxy Z Flip series.

                          Samsung is currently king. Here’s everything you need to know about the Google Pixel Fold. Google
                          officially unveiled the Pixel Fold at Google I/O on March 10, 2023. It comes in two colors —
                          Obsidian and Porcelain. You can also choose between three official Pixel Fold cases that come in
                          Hazel, Porcelain, and Bay colors (pictured above). Google is charging a similar price to the rival
                          Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4. The 256GB variant of the Pixel Fold will cost you a whopping $1,799. The
                          512GB version is even more expensive at $1,919, which seems costly for Google’s first attempt at a
                          foldable phone. Google hopes you buy the foldable Pixel for its thin form factor, “true pocket

                          availability, Google is not casting a very wide net for the Pixel Fold. The handset will only sell
                          in the US, UK, Germany, and Japan, at least to start with.

                          For charging, the Pixel Fold supports 21W wired speeds. However, you’ll have to purchase Google’s
                          30W power adapter ($25 at Google Store) separately. The phone also supports wireless charging at up
                          to 7.5W and will work with any Qi wireless charger. No. Furthermore, the Google Pixel does not
                          support pen/stylus input. The Pixel Fold’s inner display is protected by Ultra Thin Glass, complete
                          with a protective plastic layer applied. Gorilla Glass Victus protects the external display. Yes.
                          The Google Pixel Fold has an IPX8 certification, which means it can be submerged in up to 1.5
                          meters of freshwater for up to 30 minutes. No, Google no longer includes chargers with its
                          smartphones. You’ll have to buy a compatible charger that supports USB Power Delivery PPS. The
                          Google Pixel Fold supports dual SIMs. One is a nano-SIM slot, and the second is via eSIM. The Pixel
                          Fold was announced on May 10, 2023. General availability of the phone will commence in June 2023.
                          Folding phones are great for those who want a large-screen device but don’t want the size penalty
                          of carrying a tablet. Based on our hands-on experience, the Pixel Fold should also be a great
                          traditional handset when folded. There’s no indication that Google is working on a second, smaller
                          flip phone to partner the Pixel Fold or challenge the Galaxy Z Flip series.

                          May 11, 2023, marks the end of the federal COVID-19 PHE declaration. After this date, CDC’s
                          authorizations to collect certain types of public health data will expire. The United States has
                          mobilized and sustained a historic response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a nation, we now find
                          ourselves at a different point in the pandemic – with more tools and resources than ever before to
                          better protect ourselves and our communities. CDC has been working for many months to fold the
                          agency’s COVID-19 emergency response activities into its existing structure and programs, as part
                          of an ongoing transition to sustainable public health practice. The agency has also been working
                          with partners, including states and local territories, to prepare for the end of the PHE
                          declaration and communicate updated reporting requirements and cadences. While reporting frequency
                          and source data for some metrics will shift when the PHE declaration ends, CDC will continue to
                          report valuable data to inform individual and community public health actions to protect those at
                          highest risk of severe COVID-19. Our priority remains providing the information necessary to
                          protect the nation’s public health. Most tools, like vaccines, treatments, and testing, will remain
                          available. But, some tools, like certain data sources and reporting, will change. Access to
                          COVID-19 vaccines will generally not be affected for now. The U.S. government is currently
                          distributing free COVID-19 vaccines for all adults and children.

                          repurposed parts of their buildings for COVID-19 treatment or created temporary structures that
                          could be used to accept patients during a COVID-19 surge. facilities will still have the ability to

                          The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) anticipates the following changes will occur with
                          the end of the federal PHE: Federal rules that provided additional workforce to administer COVID-19
                          vaccination are set to end on October 1, 2024. These rules allowed, for example, pharmacy interns,
                          healthcare providers with recently expired licenses and those licensed to work only in one state to
                          give COVID-19 vaccines. There is ongoing deliberation at the federal level and in the courts in
                          this area. For more information on Healthcare Provider Flexibilities, visit the Public Health

                          By Tom Warren, a senior editor covering Microsoft, PC gaming, console, and tech. He founded
                          WinRumors, a site dedicated to Microsoft news, before joining The Verge in 2012. Microsoft is
                          announcing a new AI-powered Copilot for its Microsoft 365 apps and services today, designed to
                          assist people with generating documents, emails, presentations, and much more. The Copilot, powered
                          by GPT-4 from OpenAI, will sit alongside Microsoft 365 apps much like an assistant (remember
                          Clippy?), appearing in the sidebar as a chatbot that allows Office users to summon it to generate
                          text in documents, create PowerPoint presentations based on Word documents, or even help use
                          features like PivotTables in Excel. Microsoft’s Copilot leaked earlier today. “It works alongside
                          you, embedded in the apps millions of people use everyday: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams,
                          and more,” said Microsoft 365 head Jared Spataro. “Copilot is a whole new way of working.”
                          Microsoft 365 users will be able to summon Copilot to provide information on an upcoming Microsoft
                          Teams meeting, preparing people with updates on related projects, organizational changes like
                          recent hires, and even updates on co-workers who might have returned from vacation. Copilot can
                          also be summoned throughout Microsoft’s Office apps and be used in Word to draft documents based on
                          other files. The AI-generated text can then be freely edited and adapted.

                          already related to computers directly as they do with humans, the added human-like face emerged as
                          an annoying interloper distracting the user from the primary conversation.[11] First introduced in
                          Microsoft Office 97,[12] the Office Assistant was codenamed TFC during development.[13] It appeared
                          when the program determined the user could be assisted by using Office wizards, searching help, or
                          advising users on using Office features more effectively. It also presented tips and keyboard
                          shortcuts. For example, typing an address followed by "Dear" would cause the Assistant to appear
                          with the message, "It looks like you're writing a letter. Would you like help?" Microsoft turned
                          off the feature by default in Office XP.[14] The feature was removed altogether in Office 2007 and
                          Office 2008 for Mac.

                          announcing a new AI-powered Copilot for its Microsoft 365 apps and services today, designed to
                          assist people with generating documents, emails, presentations, and much more. The Copilot, powered
                          by GPT-4 from OpenAI, will sit alongside Microsoft 365 apps much like an assistant (remember
                          Clippy?), appearing in the sidebar as a chatbot that allows Office users to summon it to generate
                          text in documents, create PowerPoint presentations based on Word documents, or even help use
                          features like PivotTables in Excel. Microsoft’s Copilot leaked earlier today. “It works alongside
                          you, embedded in the apps millions of people use everyday: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams,
                          and more,” said Microsoft 365 head Jared Spataro. “Copilot is a whole new way of working.”
                          Microsoft 365 users will be able to summon Copilot to provide information on an upcoming Microsoft
                          Teams meeting, preparing people with updates on related projects, organizational changes like
                          recent hires, and even updates on co-workers who might have returned from vacation. Copilot can
                          also be summoned throughout Microsoft’s Office apps and be used in Word to draft documents based on
                          other files. The AI-generated text can then be freely edited and adapted.

                          ChatGPT Plus subscribers will be able to access GPT-4’s capabilities through the new app, OpenAI
                          says, in addition to receiving early access to new features and faster response times, the company
                          notes in its announcement. The subscription offering was launched in February and costs $20 per
                          month for the upgraded features, including access to ChatGPT even during peak times. The company
                          says the rollout of the new app will start in the U.S. today but it will expand to other countries
                          in the “coming weeks.” An Android version is also teased as “coming soon.” Image Credits: OpenAI

                          working on a mobile client, according to a February article by Semafor, which the company had then
                          declined to comment on. The ChatGPT app’s launch comes at a time when major tech companies,
                          including Google, Microsoft, and Facebook, are experimenting with AI, and in the case of Google and
                          Microsoft, also integrating AI capabilities into their search engines — the latter through an
                          expensive partnership with OpenAI, in fact. But being able to access ChatGPT directly on mobile
                          outside of a search engine or browser could potentially shake up how people today use their phones
                          to search and connect with information. One thing that could be compelling about OpenAI’s mobile
                          app versus search apps’ AI integrations is its ad-free nature.

  - Source              :
                          Subscribe for regular MacRumors news and future Apple Vision Pro info. Apple Vision Pro is Apple's
                          augmented and virtual reality headset, a device that has been in development for more than a
                          decade. Vision Pro marks the company's first entrance into a new product category since the 2015
                          Apple Watch, with the device introduced at WWDC 2023 in June. A launch is set for early 2024, which
                          means January to late April. While the Apple Vision Pro is definitely a headset, Apple does not use
                          that word when referring to it. Instead, Apple calls it a spatial computer because of its ability
                          to blend digital content with the physical world. Apple Vision Pro is a mixed reality headset that
                          displays augmented reality content overlaid on world around you, and immersive entirely virtual
                          content, but it's worth noting that the headset is not see through. Everything you see is digital.
                          For augmented reality content that does not make your surroundings disappear, Apple uses cameras
                          that map out what's in front of you, translating that into a digital image augmented by virtual
                          elements. For a virtual reality experience, Apple shuts off those cameras and can make it seem like
                          you are completely isolated from what's going on around you, allowing you to focus solely on what's
                          being displayed on the headset's screens. This shift between the "real" and the "immersive" can be
                          controlled with an on-device Digital Crown.

                          Apple did not respond to our request for comment. The headset is believed to be the same size as
                          Meta’s Oculus Quest and focused on high-tech and high-performance. Additionally, it’s said to
                          include an even more power-hungry processor than the M1 found on the MacBook Air and 13-inch
                          MacBook Pro. VR is the headset’s primary focus, but it will also offer some AR functionality, per
                          Bloomberg’s initial look at the product. Can Apple keep the AR industry alive? The new product will
                          find Apple competing directly against Meta’s Quest Pro (rumored for a release next month), and
                          PlayStation VR. According to the filing, Apple’s headset could offer both gaming and FaceTime
                          functionality, along with health and educational features. While Meta’s devices have been used for
                          some medical training, they weren’t designed with such use cases in mind. Apple is holding a big
                          event at its Cupertino HQ next week, with the iPhone 14 and Apple Watch Series 8 serving as
                          headliners. A sneak peek of the new headset could also be on the agenda, as the company looks to
                          entice developers to create content for the new category. Executives are believed to have already
                          shown off a version of the product to shareholders.

                          Subscribe for regular MacRumors news and future Apple Vision Pro info. Apple Vision Pro is Apple's
                          augmented and virtual reality headset, a device that has been in development for more than a
                          decade. Vision Pro marks the company's first entrance into a new product category since the 2015
                          Apple Watch, with the device introduced at WWDC 2023 in June. A launch is set for early 2024, which
                          means January to late April. While the Apple Vision Pro is definitely a headset, Apple does not use
                          that word when referring to it. Instead, Apple calls it a spatial computer because of its ability
                          to blend digital content with the physical world. Apple Vision Pro is a mixed reality headset that
                          displays augmented reality content overlaid on world around you, and immersive entirely virtual
                          content, but it's worth noting that the headset is not see through. Everything you see is digital.
                          For augmented reality content that does not make your surroundings disappear, Apple uses cameras
                          that map out what's in front of you, translating that into a digital image augmented by virtual
                          elements. For a virtual reality experience, Apple shuts off those cameras and can make it seem like
                          you are completely isolated from what's going on around you, allowing you to focus solely on what's
                          being displayed on the headset's screens. This shift between the "real" and the "immersive" can be
                          controlled with an on-device Digital Crown.

                          after winning the U.S. Open golf tournament at Los Angeles Country Club on Sunday, June 18, 2023,
                          in Los Angeles. (AP Photo/Matt York) LOS ANGELES (AP) — In the city of stars, Wyndham Clark had his
                          own script in mind in the U.S. Open. In front of him was Rory McIlroy, one of golf’s biggest
                          talents who looked ready to end his perplexing nine-year drought in the majors. Next to him in the
                          final group Sunday was Rickie Fowler, a Southern California native who returned from a three-year
                          slump and was poised to finally win his first major. Clark carried a message from his late mother —
                          “Play big,” she always told him — and the belief he could compete with anyone on any stage. No
                          stage was bigger than a U.S. Open on the edge of Beverly Hills. That’s where Clark delivered clutch
                          saves, a signature shot that gave him control and the steady nerves to hold off McIlroy and become
                          a major champion. “I feel like I belong on this stage,” Clark said after closing with an even-par
                          70 for a one-shot victory over McIlroy. “Even two, three years ago when people didn’t know who I
                          was, I felt like I could still play and compete against the best players in the world.

                          He missed a seven-footer for par to fall back to 10-under, but saved par from left of the green on
                          the 17th. Now with a one-shot lead playing the 18th, Clark two-putted from 60 feet to win the
                          tournament.[25] Rory McIlroy began the round a shot off the lead and opened with a birdie on the
                          first hole to tie for the lead. This was his last birdie—he did not make another the rest of the
                          round, and bogeyed the 14th after hitting his third shot into the ridge of a bunker and taking a
                          drop for an embedded lie. He finished with 70 to end up at nine-under, a shot back of Clark.[26]
                          Fowler, tied with Clark at the start of the round, made three bogeys over his first seven holes and
                          did not make a birdie until the eighth, his first since the 13th hole in the third round. His
                          birdie on the 14th was his 23rd of the tournament, establishing a new U.S. Open record. He shot a
                          five-over 75 to fall back into a tie for fifth place with Tommy Fleetwood and Min Woo Lee.[27]
                          Fleetwood, who began the round in 38th place, made two eagles and was eight-under through 14 holes
                          before a bogey at the 16th.

                          In 2022, Amazon held a second Prime Day event dubbed Prime Early Access Sale. Amazon said Prime
                          members ordered more than 100 million items from merchants during the Early Access sale. Prime Day,
                          which features deals on many products on Amazon.com, began in 2015 as a celebration of Amazon’s
                          20th year in business. It turned into a summer sales holiday designed to drum up additional
                          business for Amazon — and the retailer’s marketplace sellers — before the holiday shopping season.
                          In recent years, other large retailers have offered promotions on their own websites around Prime
                          Day to take advantage of the additional online shoppers. Amazon Prime Day takes place in more than
                          20 countries, including: Digital Commerce 360 estimates Amazon’s sales on Prime Day hit $12.09
                          billion globally during the manufactured retail holiday, which spanned July 12 and 13. That’s up
                          8.1% year over year from the same shopping spree in 2021, which ran from June 21 through 22. In
                          2021, Prime Day sales reached $11.19 billion and represented a 7.7% increase over Amazon’s 2020
                          event. Prime Day 2021 fell less than a year after the 2020 sales event, which contributed to the
                          slowdown in growth from 45.1% earlier in the pandemic. Amazon postponed Prime Day 2020, pushing it
                          from its usual summer time slot to mid-October because of the coronavirus pandemic.

Question 300              : Who was the MVP of Super Bowl 2022?

                          Where does Rams receiver's historic season rank in NFL history Kupp was also instrumental in the
                          Rams' final go-ahead drive: He converted fourth-and-1 at the Rams' 37 with a 7-yard end-around and
                          also caught three passes for 38 yards prior to his game-winning catch. That doesn't include a
                          4-yard touchdown in the back of the end zone that was nullified by offsetting penalties (holding on
                          the Rams and unnecessary roughness on the Bengals). "I don’t feel deserving of this … I don’t know
                          what to say.” — L.A. Rams star Cooper Kupp wins the Super Bowl MVP, the 8th wide receiver to do so
                          pic.twitter.com/PfvXv0S1te Indeed, Kupp helped create two drive-extending penalties in the game's
                          fateful moments: defensive holding on Logan Wilson on third-and-goal from the Bengals' 8 and
                          defensive pass interference on cornerback Eli Apple two plays later. Donald was similarly impactful
                          on the defensive side of the ball, registering four tackles (two for loss), two sacks and three
                          quarterback hits — including the one that forced an incompletion by Joe Burrow on fourth-and-1,
                          sealing the victory for Los Angeles.

  - Source              :
                          Sam Griffith (Sophia Bush) is a female lead, still a rarity in medical dramas. The cast diversity
                          is notable: Malcolm Kinglsey (Edwin Hodge) is a Black man from a wealthy, prominent family. Wealthy
                          Black Americans aren't usually showcased on television. Malcolm is also a love interest for Sam,
                          adding to the representation of interracial relationships on television. However, most of the
                          diversity comes in the form of the secondary cast (Skye P. Marshall, Omar Maskati, Davi Santos),
                          who are very involved in the main storylines. Did we miss something on diversity? Suggest an
                          update. A scene with a major character being shot. Scenes of heart surgery. A scene with a patient
                          who was punched by his wife for cheating. Did you know you can flag iffy content? Adjust limits for
                          Violence & Scariness in your kid's entertainment guide. Swear words like "ass," "damnit," "ass
                          kisser." Did you know you can flag iffy content? Adjust limits for Language in your kid's
                          entertainment guide. Parents need to know that Good Sam is a medical procedural featuring a
                          father-and-daughter heart surgeon team who hash out their familial drama as they save patients.
                          Parents should be aware of scenes featuring simulated heart surgery and other scary topics, such as
                          conversations about a near-fatal car accident, "coding" (needing to be resuscitated), and other
                          medical lingo.

                          Heaven, and the jokes still land over 30 years later. Little Miss Sunshine is a heartwarming indie

                          nearly a year earlier — he had to fix one glaring issue. So he headed straight for the office of
                          linebackers coach Jason Semore. Semore, known to his friends as Boogie, instantly knew what Key
                          wanted to discuss. Something had to be done about Georgia Tech’s punt protection. The Yellow
                          Jackets had four punts blocked in their first four games. A block two days earlier at UCF had been
                          returned for a touchdown and erased a Georgia Tech lead just before halftime. Clemson had blocked
                          two punts in the season opener. Ole Miss had blocked one near the start of a 42-0 blowout. Of all
                          the things Georgia Tech had done wrong over the course of a 1-3 start, punt protection was the most
                          consistently bad.

                          amazing 87 percent in a turbulent marketplace. Anyone who thinks the legacy automakers are catching
                          Tesla in the electric-vehicle sales race should take a quick look at some recently released
                          figures. Over the weekend, Tesla announced it delivered 308,600 vehicles in the fourth quarter of
                          2021. Model S and Model X EVs made up 11,750 of those deliveries, while the bulk—296,850—were Model
                          3 and Model Y deliveries. These numbers brought Tesla's 2021 full-year deliveries to 936,172
                          vehicles. The 936,000 vehicle deliveries represent an 87 percent increase from 2020, Reuters and
                          other news sources noted, based on Tesla's announcement dated January 2, while the 306,600
                          deliveries for the quarter mean that Tesla delivered 71 percent more electric vehicles in the
                          fourth quarter of 2021 than it did a year earlier. Reuters reportssemiconductor chipsTesla doesn't
                          break out its deliveries by country, but its sales are strongest in Europe and China, the notes.
                          Tesla itself called those two regions "important markets" in its last SEC filing, but the U.S. is
                          still the region where Tesla makes the most money. In the third quarter of 2021, for example, an
                          shows Tesla made more than $6 billion in revenue in the U.S., compared to $3.

                          Analysts predict that Tesla’s rapid growth can accelerate in the third quarter and beyond. Speaking
                          at the annual shareholder meeting, Elon Musk mentioned the company’s future production plans,
                          saying that by the end of 2022, Tesla might reach an annual production run rate of 2 million
                          vehicles: “We’re aiming to achieve a 2 million vehicle run-rate by the end of the year… Thanks to
                          the hard work of the Tesla team, we’ve already been able to achieve a 1.5 million unit annualized
                          run rate. And depending on how the rest of this year goes, I think we might get close to, or will
                          get approximately at the 1.5 million mark, and will be exiting the year at a 2 million-unit
                          run-rate,” Musk said. In the fourth quarter of 2022, Tesla delivered nearly 405,300 units. Its
                          quarterly deliveries grew by 17.87% during this quarter, compared to the same quarter of 2021.
                          Between November and December 2022, Tesla’s deliveries crossed the 405,000 unit mark, setting a new
                          record. The deliveries in the third quarter of 2022 totaled 343,000. Overall, in 2022, Tesla
                          delivered 1,313,851 and produced 1,369,611 units. Since 2018, Tesla has delivered 3,382,821 and has
                          produced 3,429,532 cars.

                          Super Bowl LVI[12] was an American football game played to determine the champion of the National

                          Angeles Rams defeated the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Cincinnati Bengals, 23–20.
                          The game was played on February 13, 2022, at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, the home
                          stadium of the Rams, marking the second consecutive and second overall Super Bowl with a team
                          playing and winning in its home stadium.[13][14][15][16] The Rams' victory was their second, first
                          as a Los Angeles-based team, and first since winning 1999's Super Bowl XXXIV when they were based
                          in St. Louis. Finishing with a 12–5 record, the Rams reached their fifth appearance after acquiring

                          the Detroit Lions. The Bengals, who finished with a 10–7 record, were seeking their first Super
                          Bowl title following several decades of losing seasons and playoff struggles. They won their first
                          playoff game since 1990, ending the longest drought in the four major North American sports, en

                          Because New Orleans was supposed to host it, but a conflict with Mardi Gras forced them to push
                          hosting back to 2025. The NFL officially announced that Las Vegas would host the 2024 Super Bowl.
                          Allegiant Stadium, the new home of the Raiders, will host Super Bowl 58, which is no surprise given
                          that the NFL prioritizes hosting the Super Bowl at stadiums with recently updated and upgraded
                          amenities. Location also plays a role in this, as the NFL has historically preferred warm-weather
                          locations for stadiums without a dome. SoFi Stadium has a roof, but the sides of the structure are
                          open. As such, it is considered an open-air stadium. Below are the sites the NFL has pinned as
                          future Super Bowl locations. The Super Bowl halftime show will feature five rap and R&B legends in
                          2022. Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Mary J. Blige and Kendrick Lamar will be the performers for the
                          spectacle. The quintet has a combined total of 43 Grammys and 21 Billboard No. 1 albums. For more

                          Guyton. She recently became the first Black artist to earn a Grammy nomination for Best Country
                          Album of the Year. Eric Church and Jazmine Sullivan performed the anthem in 2021.

                          49][50] For instance while Los Angeles has been a eight-time host city with its most recent being
                          Super Bowl LVI in 2022, it did not host one from the departure of both its NFL teams in 1995 until
                          the Rams and the Chargers subsequently came back to Los Angeles in 2016 and 2017 respectively. The
                          Louisiana Superdome has hosted seven Super Bowls, the most of any venue, with an eighth Super Bowl
                          scheduled to take place in the 2024–25 season. The Orange Bowl was the only AFL stadium to host a
                          Super Bowl and the only stadium to host consecutive Super Bowls, hosting Super Bowls II and III.
                          Seven Super Bowls have been held in a stadium other than the one the NFL team in that city was
                          using at the time, a situation that has not arisen after Super Bowl XXVII's host stadium was
                          selected on March 19, 1991. This was as the winning market was previously not required to host the
                          Super Bowl in the same stadium that its NFL team used, if the stadium in which the Super Bowl was
                          held was perceived to be a better stadium for a large high-profile event than the existing NFL home
                          stadium in the same city; for example, Los Angeles's last five Super Bowls were all played at the
                          Rose Bowl, which has never been used by any NFL franchise outside of the Super Bowl.

                          with Parler, Gab and Mastodon in trying to provide an alternative to Twitter and
                          Facebook.[2][4][7][1] The service was launched on February 21, 2022.[8] Since mid-2022, Truth
                          Social has been facing financial and regulatory issues. The application was initially not available
                          on Google Play because of violations of Google policies prohibiting content with physical threats
                          and incitement to violence, but was approved for Google Play in October 2022 after agreeing to
                          enforce policies against incitement.[9] As of March 6, 2023[update], it was ranked number 101 in
                          Apple's App Store rankings for social media apps,[10] and SimilarWeb ranked its website as number
                          203 in their "News & Media Publishers" category, behind Gab at number 154, but ahead of Parler at
                          number 1,052.[11][12] Trump estimated in an April 2023 personal financial disclosure that the

                          Reports say that Trump has been privately complaining that Google was trying to "fuck" him.
                          According to Rolling Stones' source, however, the truth is that Truth Social hasn't even submitted
                          an Android app to the Google Play store yet. Still, though, the launch of a web app is significant.
                          Truth Social profiles and posts will now be completely shareable on other platforms. Using the
                          iPhone app, if you want to share a Truth Social post on another platform, you have to take a
                          screenshot. Now, Truth Social users will be able to post links directly to any account or post. In
                          turn, non-Truth Social users will have direct access to sign up and engage with content on the
                          site. (Note: Internal Truth Social links currently require users to login to their account in order
                          to see the content.) In short: It's going to be a lot easier for Trump's fanbase to share his
                          content on other platforms. Launched in February, Truth Social struggled during the first few
                          months. Downloads plummeted after the initial rush to download due to a long waitlist of users
                          wanting to sign up. However, in recent weeks, Trump finally started posting on his own platform,
                          which has helped give the conservative social network another bounce. Truth Social announced a
                          public beta of the web app just last week. According to a press release from Wednesday, the initial
                          web app rollout was scheduled for some time over the next week or two.

                          Press Association announced the winners for the 79th Annual Golden Globe Awards tonight with The
                          Power of the Dog named Best Motion Picture – Drama and West Side Story as Best Motion Picture –
                          Musical or Comedy. On the television side, Succession won Best Television Series – Drama, while
                          Hacks won for Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy. After a year of controversy about
                          diversity, payola, and improper behavior endemic to the organization that culminated in the Globes
                          losing its NBC broadcast, tonight’s coverage and the subsequent congratulatory marketing from
                          winners will be a good litmus test for if the beleaguered organization can rinse off some of the
                          stink from a year of bad headlines and even more puzzling decisions. If you need a refresher on the
                          ins and outs of what happened read our recap of how we got here. Over the last eight months, the
                          HFPA has reformed its bylaws, implementing changes that address ethics and code of conduct,
                          diversity, equity and inclusion, governance, and membership. The HFPA recently admitted their
                          largest and most diverse class to date of 21 new members, all of whom are first-time Golden Globe
                          voters.

                          On the TV side, ABC comedy Abbott Elementary — which boasted the most nominations of any show with
                          five — built off of its Emmy momentum and went to the head of the class, winning best comedy honors
                          and Golden Globes for Quinta Brunson and Tyler James Williams. An even bigger Emmy magnet, HBO's
                          The White Lotus, enjoyed the privilege of converting its four nominations into two awards, one for
                          best limited series and another for Jennifer Coolidge (who also delivered the funniest speech of
                          the night). And then Game of Thrones prequel House of the Dragon added some surprise to the night
                          by claiming the best drama award. Elsewhere, Tár's Cate Blanchett, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever's
                          Angela Bassett, and Elvis' Austin Butler scored trophies, along with The Bear's Jeremy Allen White,
                          Euphoria's Zendaya, and Yellowstone's Kevin Costner. In addition, Murphys were honored: Five-time
                          Globe winner Ryan Murphy was given the Carol Burnett Award and Eddie Murphy was handed the Cecil B.

                          Concerns about the lack of diversity in the HFPA board and the award nominees were brought up last
                          year, and similar concerns were still brought up this year. Similar to NBC’s stance, many actors
                          were absent in a statement to demand change. Winning actors including Will Smith, Nicole Kidman,
                          Andrew Garfield and Rachel Zegler were not present to receive their awards. While the HFPA has
                          announced new policies for diversity, equity and inclusion, and inducted 21 new members, including
                          several people of color as well as the addition of Neil Phillips as chief diversity officer, the
                          future of the Golden Globes still remains uncertain. Despite the controversy, though, many films
                          and television shows have much to celebrate as their casts and crews were recognized for their hard
                          work. Best Motion Picture — Musical or Comedy: “West Side Story” After receiving 4 nominations,
                          Steven Spielberg’s 2021 adaptation of the 1957 musical dominated the Comedy/Musical category at the
                          79th Golden Globe Awards. “West Side Story,” won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture —
                          Musical/Comedy and Best Supporting Actress Role — Motion Picture (Ariana DeBose). The film scored
                          two additional wins via Rachel Zegler, who made her film debut as the female lead, Maria Vasquez,
                          and Arianna Debose, who played Anita.

                          arguing for a block on the deal in district court, and was denied an extension of a temporary block

                          ad on national TV during primetime averages $115,000 – a number the Super Bowl surpassed in the
                          1970s, according to Nielsen Media Research. The automobile and food and beverage industries make up
                          the bulk of spending. A FOX Business analysis in 2020 marked out Honda, FedEx, Miller, Dodge,
                          Toyota, Ford, McDonald’s, Coca-Cola, Pepsi and Budweiser as the companies that have spent the most
                          over the years, with Budweiser spending $449.5 million on 135 ads across 53 Super Bowls. The Super
                          Bowl crossed the landmark $1 million mark in 1995, climbing to $2 million in the new millennium.
                          The price steadily rose over the following decade, reaching 2.95 million in 2010. SUPER BOWL 2022:

                          Seahawks.com Writer The great week for Seahawks wide receiver Tyler Lockett continues. Just days
                          after learning his feature on Black Wall Street had won an Emmy Award, Lockett was honored again on
                          Thursday night as the 2022 Seattle Male Sports Star of The Year. The live awards show has been a
                          tradition in Emerald City dating back to 1936. Created by the Seattle Post-Intelligencer and
                          renowned sports editor Royal Brougham, the show has honored some of the biggest names to play
                          professional sports in the city. Since arriving in Seattle from Kansas State in 2015, Lockett has
                          developed into a reliable and incredibly productive receiver in the Seahawks offense, and 2021 was
                          arguably his best season yet, setting a career high with 1,175 receiving yards, his
                          third-consecutive 1,000-yard season. The successes have continued off the field. Lockett received
                          the 2021 Steve Largent Award, given annually to the team contributor who best exemplifies the
                          spirit, dedication, and integrity of the Seahawks. He was also the Seahawks nominee for the NFL's
                          Walter Payton Man of the Year Award, recognizing a player for their excellence on and off the
                          field. And if that wasn't enough, Lockett passed his real estate licensing exam earlier this
                          offseason, selling his first home in April.

                          In 1961, three Black students began classes at Georgia Tech and made history, making the Institute
                          the first higher education entity to peacefully integrate in the Deep South without a court order.
                          Civil unrest was rampant throughout college campuses across the South. In recognition of their
                          roles as trailblazers, Tech’s first Black students — Lawrence Williams, Ralph Long Jr., and the
                          late Ford Greene, along with the first Black graduate Ronald Yancey — were awarded the 2022 Ivan
                          Allen Jr. Prize for Social Courage on April 20 at the Biltmore Ballroom in Atlanta. A symposium was
                          led by 2020 Ivan Allen Jr. Prize recipient Charlayne Hunter-Gault where Long Jr., Williams, and
                          Yancey discussed the integration of the Institute, the former students’ personal experiences, and
                          the continued struggle for racial equity and inclusion at higher education institutes across the
                          nation. During the panel session, the three former students recounted the racism they encountered —
                          despite a facade of peaceful integration. Although their experiences left them feeling socially and
                          intellectually isolated from most of the student body at the time, the pioneers expressed their
                          hope that future generations of Black students at Tech feel at home on campus. “I’m so thankful for
                          those who continue to matriculate here and carry on the tradition,” said Williams. A video greeting
                          from Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens, a Georgia Tech chemical engineering graduate himself, was
                          presented at the celebration.

Question 17              : What is the codename for Google's AR headset project?

                          Project Iris headset is the next big thing from Google with Augmented Reality (AR) to compete with;
                          Metaverse and upcoming tech from Microsoft and Apple. Previously, the tech giant was in the plan to
                          bring the DayDream VR headsets as well as Google Glasses. Now, the boom of Augmented Reality might
                          have changed the direction of the company to concentrate on the AR world making them join the
                          league after Facebook, Microsoft, and Apple. The codename of these new AR headsets is Project Iris
                          and Google may use a similar type of outer camera technology. The outward cameras on the headsets
                          will blend computer graphics with a feed of the real world. The headset from Google will work
                          wirelessly and doesn’t require any tethered connection as per the reports. Moreover, Project Iris
                          will feature the Silicon technology chipset from the last year’s announced Pixel 6 smartphone. This
                          Augmented Reality headset from Google looks like a pair of “ski goggles” with cameras on them which
                          doesn’t require external power. Furthermore, the specific chipset used on the headsets is the GS101
                          chipset; however, the graphic-intensive visuals are sourced from a different point. This means the
                          headset requires an active internet connection; that receives the data from the data centers that
                          remotely render graphics. Also Read: 9 Best PS5 Headsets For Amazing Gaming Experience As we have
                          mentioned above the design of the prototype looks like the Ski Goggles; Google has revealed the

                          Daniel Dominguez Meta has unveiled its AI Research SuperCluster (RSC) supercomputer, aimed at
                          accelerating AI research and helping the company build the metaverse. The RSC will help the company
                          build new and better AI models, working across hundreds of different languages, and to develop new
                          augmented reality tools. Developing the next generation of advanced AI will require powerful new
                          computers capable of quintillions of operations per second. Meta’s researchers have already started
                          using RSC to train large models in natural-language processing (NLP) and computer vision for
                          research, with the aim of one day training models with trillions of parameters across Meta’s
                          businesses, from content-moderation algorithms used to detect hate speech on Facebook and
                          Instagram, to augmented-reality features that will one day be available in the metaverse. RSC can
                          train models that use multimodal signals to determine whether an action, sound or image is harmful
                          or benign. Meta claims this will not only help keep people safe on Meta’s services today, but also
                          in the metaverse.

                          appeal was also made for the subsequent Paralympic Games. The appeal is made every two years, right
                          before the start of either the Summer or Winter Olympics and Paralympics. Beijing 2022 Tokyo 2020

                          ekecheria, is based on an ancient Greek tradition, dating back to the eighth century B.C. All
                          conflicts ceased during the period of the Truce, which began seven days prior to the opening of the
                          Olympic Games and ended on the seventh day following the closing of the Games, so that athletes,
                          artists, their relatives and pilgrims could travel safely to the Olympic Games and afterwards
                          return to their countries.

                          Atlanta, Miami, Los Angeles and Tampa Bay were the four candidates for the three contests; Atlanta
                          received Super Bowl LIII, Miami received Super Bowl LIV and Los Angeles (which declined to bid on
                          Super Bowl LIV and was not eligible for Super Bowl LIII) was granted Super Bowl LV.[20] On May 18,
                          2017, authorities announced that the opening of Los Angeles's new stadium, SoFi Stadium, originally
                          scheduled for the start of the 2019 season, had been delayed a year to 2020. As a result, at the
                          league's owners meetings in Chicago on May 23, 2017, the league re-awarded Super Bowl LV to the
                          lone remaining candidate, Tampa Bay, and awarded Super Bowl LVI to Los Angeles.[21] The official
                          logo for the game was unveiled on February 9, 2021, maintaining the standard design used since
                          Super Bowl LI, but introducing sunset-themed[22] designs reflecting the landscape of the host
                          city/nearby area (featuring in this case palm trees) within the traditional Roman numerals.[23] In
                          early January 2022, it was reported that AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, was being considered as
                          an alternate site for the game as a contingency plan due to an increase of COVID-19 infections in
                          California attributed to the Omicron variant. The stadium last hosted Super Bowl XLV in 2011.

                          receive such an honor. October 05, 2022 LA JOLLA, CA—Scripps Research professor K. Barry Sharpless,
                          PhD, has been awarded the 2022 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his groundbreaking research in
                          developing “click chemistry,” an ingenious method for building molecules. Sharpless, the W.M. Keck
                          Professor of Chemistry, shares the prize with Carolyn R. Bertozzi, PhD, of Stanford University and
                          Morten Meldal, PhD, of the University of Copenhagen for the development of click chemistry and
                          bioorthogonal chemistry, according to the Nobel Prize committee. Sharpless previously shared the
                          2001 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on chirally catalyzed oxidation reactions, making him
                          the second scientist ever to win two Nobel Prizes in Chemistry. Frederick Sanger won the Nobel
                          Prize in Chemistry in 1958 and 1980. “Barry Sharpless has had a tremendous impact on chemistry,
                          first with his development of asymmetric synthesis and now with his elegant ‘click chemistry,’”
                          says Peter Schultz, PhD, President and CEO of Scripps Research. “His work opened whole new
                          scientific frontiers that have had a major impact on the fields of chemistry, biology and medicine.

                          Bioorthogonal reactions are used widely to investigate vital processes in cells, and those
                          applications have had an enormous impact on the fields of biology and biochemistry. Researchers can
                          probe how biomolecules interact within cells, and they can image living cells without disturbing
                          them. In studies of disease, bioorthogonal reactions are useful for studying not just the cells of
                          patients but also those of pathogens: The proteins in bacteria can be labeled to follow their
                          movements through the body. Researchers are also starting to develop engineered antibodies that can

                          Bowl XLII? For the second straight year, we had a truly exciting game, in which the Cardinals
                          rallied from being down 20-7 to take a 23-20 lead, only to have Ben Roethlisberger come through in

                          of bad mis-matches, the Super Bowl has once again become a game worth watching in its entirety.
                          Super Bowl XLIV--New Orleans 31, Indianapolis 17--This was the first meeting of #1 seeds in the
                          Super Bowl since 1993, and both teams got off to blistering regular season starts--the Colts 14-0
                          before losing their last two, and the Saints 13-0 before losing their last three games. But both
                          dominated in the postseason until meeting in Miami. The Colts were favored, but they hadn't faced
                          an offense quite like New Orleans'. And though the Colts jumped out to a 10-0 lead, Drew Brees
                          methodically picked the Colts' defense apart, and Sean Payton gambled and won with an onside kick
                          to start the second half. Of course, Tracy Porter's pick six of Peyton Manning late in the fourth
                          quarter was the clincher. Super Bowl LVII: Kansas City Chiefs 38, Philadelphia Eagles 35.

Question 25              : When was Lost Ark game release on Steam?

  - Source              :
                          Lost Ark was fully released in South Korea on December 4, 2019, and in North American, South
                          American, and European regions on February 11, 2022, with Amazon Games serving as the global
                          publisher.[16] Users that pre-purchased one of four founder's packs could play 3 days early on
                          February 8, 2022.[17][18][19][20] The game was initially unavailable in Belgium and the Netherlands
                          due to the countries' stringent loot box regulations,[21] with the latter later reversing its
                          decision.[22] Within twenty-four hours of its release, Lost Ark became the second most played game
                          on Steam.[23][24] In 2021, there were plans between Smilegate and game publisher HappyTuk [zh] to
                          launch Lost Ark in Taiwan.[25] It was announced in 2023 that the release of Taiwanese servers has
                          been delayed but not canceled.[26] Lost Ark received "generally favorable" reviews according to
                          review aggregator Metacritic.[27] PC Magazine praised Lost Ark's combat, writing, "Abilities look
                          good, sound sufficiently powerful, and feel great to use. You can’t help but feel like a combat god
                          when you divekick a crowd, and blast fodder monsters into bloody chunks.

                          Update 2/16/2022: Amazon Games and Smilegate have announced some updated numbers for Lost Ark's big
                          opening weekend, including a peak of over 1.2 million concurrent viewers on Twitch and over 59.9
                          million hours watched cumulatively during launch week. Additionally, in the first three days of its
                          launch, Lost Ark gained over 4.7 million new registered players in the West. Original story:
                          Following its official free-to-play launch on February 11, Lost Ark has already become Steam's
                          second most-played game of all time by concurrent players with an all-time peak of 1,325,305
                          people. As revealed by SteamDB, Lost Ark passed Counter-Strike: Global Offensive's all-time peak of
                          1,308,963 players to secure the #2 spot. Considering these all-time peaks tend to happen around a
                          game's release, it may be quite an uphill battle to take down PUBG's record of 3,257,248 players at
                          one time. That aside, it's an impressive feat for the MMO that is developed by Smilegate and Tripod
                          Studio and published by Amazon Game Studios. This accomplishment shouldn't come as too much of a
                          surprise as Lost Ark had already become one of Steam's biggest-ever games before it even went
                          free-to-play. As with many MMOs or online games, there were some server issues as millions of
                          players attempted to play Lost Ark at once.

                          In an effort to help relieve server stress, Smilegate offered players extra Founders Pack items to
                          encourage players to swap to quieter servers. In our Lost Ark review in progress, we said, "Lost
                          Ark takes a genuinely impressive stab at the isometric action RPG genre, and its integration into a
                          perpetually online world hasn’t seemed too invasive from what I’ve seen so far. It’s expansive and
                          deep, capable of scratching the itch for a new Diablo-like action RPG that is potentially filled
                          with other players to meet and team up with. The excellent and flexible combat system channels the
                          best of its ARPG forebears, but it can start to wear out after you’ve slaughtered your way through
                          enough lower-tier enemies." Lost Ark was first released in South Korea in 2019 and later in Japan
                          and Russia, and now North American and European players can jump into Lost Ark's action, which
                          includes 15 playable characters, a full campaign, and co-op PvE combat. Have a tip for us? Want to

  - Source              :
                          October 30, 2020 • 3 For the last decade, Marvel has led the adaptations of superhero comic books
                          into films. In 2019, the journey culminated in the release of Avengers: Endgame, which premiered to
                          critical and commercial success. It had gone from a story about a playboy billionaire (Tony
                          Stark/Iron Man) to a larger story than spanned universes as well as heroes and villains alike.
                          Although, as the universe expanded, it was hard to ignore that Marvel’s roster of superheroes still
                          lacked diversity. This was made even more apparent when other superhero stories started to make
                          their way into the mainstream. In the same year that Endgame came out, a quiet and subversive TV
                          show was making waves. The Boys is adapted from a graphic novel of the same name, one that is
                          notorious amongst fans and haters alike for its crude, graphic and violent nature. The series
                          considers what would happen if superheroes existed in the real world. The short answer is that they
                          would become an untouchable commodity that could wreak havoc, which would be cleaned up by their
                          slick and all-powerful parent company Vought. The series touches on power, social media, politics
                          and causes the line between hero and villain to become truly blurred. It is difficult not to draw
                          comparisons between the storylines in The Boys and the reality of the MCU (Marvel Cinematic
                          Universe).

                          Elden Ring has sold more 13.4 million copies to date and continues to gather new fans with every
                          day that passes. It’s been a near ever-present in the steam charts since its release in February
                          and you’d certainly be hard pushed to find a better Game of the Year contender outside
                          FromSoftware’s latest action RPG. But despite many fans diving back into the game over and over
                          again (there is 6 endings after all), most of the community are desperate to see what the developer
                          does with the game next, especially with regards to more post-launch content. At this point,
                          nothing has been officially announced with both FromSoftware and Publisher Bandai Namco avoiding
                          any concrete answers on the future of the game. That being said, FromSoftware does have a history
                          of releasing DLC for their previous titles. Dark Souls 1-3, Bloodborne and Sekiro: Shadows Die
                          Twice all received hefty post-launch support and content updates. There have also been hints in
                          press releases, with one including a quote from Bandai Namco Entertainment President and CEO Yasuo
                          Miyakawa which talks about “expanding the brand beyond the game itself”. Clearly Bandai Namco know
                          they need to capitalise on a game as significant as Elden Ring, and you would imagine one of the
                          easiest ways to do that would be via post launch content.

                          41] As a result, she entered the top 15 for the first time in her career, in March 2021.[42] Seeded
                          15th, Świątek won her first career WTA 1000-title at the Italian Open, defeating former champion
                          Karolína Plíšková in just 46 minutes without the loss of a single game. She advanced to the final
                          after defeating two-time champion and world No. 5, Elina Svitolina, and the second best-ranked
                          teenager Coco Gauff on the same day, as well as saving match points in her third-round match

                          Iga Swiatek has done it again. For the second time this year, she’s standing at the top of a
                          podium, holding a Grand Slam trophy above her head. This time, she defeated Ons Jabeur 6-2, 7-6(5)
                          to win the 2022 US Open, capping off a year of incredible and unexpected success. Swiatek, who
                          looked extremely nervous before the match began, looked anything but once the rackets started
                          swinging. She came out strong, showing off all the skills we know her for: explosive movement,
                          pinpoint precision and a soft touch. By comparison, Jabeur, who looked comfortable and happy before
                          the match started, came out looking flat and tentative. It wasn't until Swiatek was up 3-0 that
                          Jabeur got on the board. Then, in the fifth game of the first set, Jabeur hit four winners, each
                          one perfectly placed along the singles sideline. All Swiatek could do with those is watch them
                          bounce as Jabeur narrowed the gap at 3-2. Unfortunately, that was the last game Jabeur won in the
                          first set. Swiatek was able to reach balls that most people couldn't even try for, while Jabeur
                          couldn't stop hitting the ball into the net at the most vital moments. Swiatek claimed the first
                          set in 30 minutes flat, and made it look as effortless as ever.

                          The second set was entirely different from the first. While Jabeur again didn't win a game until
                          Swiatek was up 3-0, she finally found her gear. Her excellent slice finally began to appear and she
                          began going to the net more, helping her win four of the next five games. Swiatek appeared to have
                          finally wrestled the momentum of the match back to her side, breaking a 5-5 tie to get within one
                          game of the title, but she couldn't close and Jabeur tied it up once again. The tiebreak was close,
                          and it looked like Jabeur could run away with it at any moment, but an unforced error from Jabeur
                          ended the tiebreak and gave Swiatek her first US Open championship and her third career Grand Slam
                          trophy. When it was all over, Swiatek and Jabeur shared a heartfelt embrace, and then Swiatek
                          immediately burst into happy tears. She'd earned it. This victory puts an exclamation point on the
                          best year of Swiatek's young career — or the best year of anyone’s career, really. She started 2022
                          by falling just short of the finals at the Australian Open (she was knocked out in the semis by
                          Danielle Collins), but she rebounded to produce one of the most dominant stretches of tennis we’ve
                          seen in decades. Swiatek beat Annet Kontaveit to win the Qatar Open.

                          The 32 medals won by Russian athletes mark the most medals ever won by Russian athletes in on
                          Winter Olympics, regardless of representation. Host-nation China delivered its best Winter Olympics
                          performance, scoring the third-most gold medals (9) but ranking 11th with 15 total medals. The
                          nation's previous best total was 11 total medals, reached in both 2006 and 2010. For the United
                          States, Nathan Chen, Jessie Diggins, Lindsey Jacobellis, Elana Meyers Taylor, and Madison Hubbell
                          and Zach Donohue all secured multiple medals. Jacobellis is the only athlete to win two gold
                          medals. After PyeongChang saw a Winter Olympics-record 30 different National Olympic Committees win
                          medals, 29 different NOCs claimed at least one medal in Beijing. We've come a long way since the
                          inaugural Winter Olympics in 1924, when 16 events across six sports were decided in Chamonix,
                          France. *It should be noted that ROC's gold medal in the team figure skating event is provisional
                          and dependent upon the adjudication of Kamila Valieva's doping case. The U.S. finished second with

Question 32              : Who won the Male Vocalist of the Year at the 2022 CMA ?
Correct Answers         :

  - Answer              : Chris Stapleton
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          Chris Stapleton won the trophy for Male Vocalist of the Year at the 2022 CMA Awards, beating out
                          fellow nominees Eric Church, Luke Combs, Cody Johnson and Morgan Wallen. Visibly moved by the win,
                          Stapleton used the opportunity to share his appreciation with those who have supported his career
                          through the years. "This is a dream every minute we get to live this," he told the crowd during his
                          acceptance speech. "I'm evidence that dreams come true all the time, so thank you, thank you to
                          everybody." Stapleton's Wednesday night win marks the second consecutive year that he has won the
                          Male Vocalist of the Year trophy, and his sixth win in the category overall. From 2015 to 2018, the
                          singer had a hot streak as Male Vocalist, but Combs toppled his reign for two years in 2019 and
                          2020. Still, in 2022, Stapleton's steady traditionalism and consistency as a live act won the day.
                          Together with his All-American Road Show, the singer has been one of country music's most prolific
                          and reliable touring acts this year, and he is even the subject of a current Country Music Hall of
                          Fame exhibit. Early in the year, he won three Grammy Awards, including Best Country Album for his
                          late 2020 project, Starting Over. The 2022 CMA Awards aired live from Nashville's Bridgestone Arena

                          Chris Stapleton won the trophy for Male Vocalist of the Year at the 2022 CMA Awards, beating out
                          fellow nominees Eric Church, Luke Combs, Cody Johnson and Morgan Wallen. Visibly moved by the win,
                          Stapleton used the opportunity to share his appreciation with those who have supported his career
                          through the years. "This is a dream every minute we get to live this," he told the crowd during his
                          acceptance speech. "I'm evidence that dreams come true all the time, so thank you, thank you to
                          everybody." Stapleton's Wednesday night win marks the second consecutive year that he has won the
                          Male Vocalist of the Year trophy, and his sixth win in the category overall. From 2015 to 2018, the
                          singer had a hot streak as Male Vocalist, but Combs toppled his reign for two years in 2019 and
                          2020. Still, in 2022, Stapleton's steady traditionalism and consistency as a live act won the day.
                          Together with his All-American Road Show, the singer has been one of country music's most prolific
                          and reliable touring acts this year, and he is even the subject of a current Country Music Hall of
                          Fame exhibit. Early in the year, he won three Grammy Awards, including Best Country Album for his
                          late 2020 project, Starting Over. The 2022 CMA Awards aired live from Nashville's Bridgestone Arena
                          on ABC.

Question 34              : What chip does the iPhone 14 have?

  - Source              :
                          This means that these devices will retain the A15 processor that is currently inside the iPhone 13
                          lineup. 9to5Mac was also able to independently corroborate this. The iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14
                          Pro Max, however, will see an upgraded processor. These two devices are expected to feature the new
                          A16 chip inside. By differentiating the chip between the four iPhone 14 models, Apple is
                          essentially giving customers an additional reason to opt for the higher-end (and more expensive)
                          iPhone 14 Pro models. While we’re still waiting on real-world testing, the roadmap from Apple’s
                          supper TSMC indicates that the A16 chip will be manufactured with the same 5-nanometer process as
                          the A15, which is also the same as the A14. Sticking to the same fabrication size limits the
                          year-over-year performance improvements, but it doesn’t mean we won’t see any improvements. From
                          the A14 to the A15 chips, Apple delivered ~10% performance and efficiency improvements. It’s
                          unclear whether we’ll see similar bumps this year, but we wouldn’t expect completely flat
                          year-over-year performance gains. One sketchy iPhone 14 Pro rumor suggested that the first testing
                          with the A16 chip indicated performance would only be a “few percent” better than the A15. Apple
                          then, however, worked to improve the chip’s thermal management, leading to a bigger jump in
                          performance than initially expected.

                          That's in line with when Google normally holds its developers conference — last year's edition took
                          place on May 11 and May 12, for example. There will be an in-person event at the Shoreline
                          Amphitheatre in Mountain View, Calif., a venue that's just down the street from Google
                          headquarters. Most people will attend virtually, though since Google streams its developer
                          conference. The Google I/O 2023 website promises a kickoff keynote that gets underway at 1 p.m. ET/
                          10 a.m. PT/ 6 p.m. BST on May 10. A developer keynote will follow afterward, diving into more
                          detail on tools available to Google developers. You can find a full Google I/O 2013 schedule
                          listing the different presentations. The Google I/O 2023 agenda doesn't provide any specific
                          details about what's in store on May 10. But we can make some educated guesses about what's on tap,
                          given Google's past announcements and rumors about the company's current plans. Google Bard is just
                          the start of the company's grand plans for AI-powered search. According to a report in The New York
                          Times, Samsung is considering ditching Google as the default search engine for its devices in favor
                          of Bing. And Google is feverishly working on the next stage of its search engine which will
                          integrate a chatbot. Dubbed Project Magi, Google has reportedly devoted a large portion of its
                          staff to accelerating the implementation of AI into its search engine.

                          Google I/O, or simply I/O, is an annual developer conference held by Google in Mountain View,

                          googol and the "O" representing the first "0" in the number.[1] The format of the event is similar
                          to Google Developer Day. Google I/O 2020 was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but Google I/O
                          2021 took place online. Google I/O returned to its in-person format in 2022; Google I/O 2022 took
                          place as an in-person conference for the first time since the one held in 2019. Major topics

                          I/O 2023 will provide more details on these projects and may also offer insights on many other
                          upcoming ones that Google is working on behind the scenes. Google showcased the Pixel Tablet last
                          year at I/O 2022, and then again during the Pixel launch event in October. There aren't many
                          surprises left, but we should finally find out the price and launch date. For context, the device
                          is not meant to compete with the Galaxy Tab series but will instead be targeted at those looking
                          for a basic tablet to keep at home for everyday use. I/O 2023 will also give us better insights
                          into all the new bells and whistles of Android 14, especially new privacy and security features.
                          We're not expecting Android 14 to be a major update by any means, but we did see some minor but
                          nifty features in the Android 14 Beta 1. Google released its debut smartwatch, the Pixel Watch, at
                          I/O last year... and it's not great. The device suffers from poor battery life, a small screen,
                          huge bezels, and has some features locked behind a subscription paywall. All that's on top of the
                          hefty $350 price tag. Suffice to say, we're expecting the Pixel Watch 2 to be better in every way.
                          The Pixel 7a, Pixel Fold, Pixel Watch 2, and Pixel Tablet will be among the many things Google will
                          talk about at I/O 2023.

                          By Dave McNary Film Reporter Fox has attached “The Big Short” writer-director Adam McKay to its
                          movie adaptation of “Irredeemable” from Boom! Comics. “Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters”
                          writer-director Tommy Wirkola is writing the screenplay. McKay and Charles Randolph won the best
                          adapted screenplay Oscar for “The Big Short.” Producers are Boom! Studios’ Ross Richie and Stephen
                          Christy along with Gary Sanchez’s McKay and Kevin Messick. Adam Yoelin is a co-producer. Boom! has
                          a first-look deal at Fox. The comic-book, written by Mark Waid, was published between 2009 and 2012
                          for a total of 37 issues and centered on fallen superhero the Plutonian, who begins slaughtering
                          the population of Earth. His former allies, the superhero group the Paradigm, attempt to find a way
                          to stop his rampage but none of them are as powerful as the maniac holding the world hostage. The
                          Paradigm then turns in desperation to a famous supervillain for help. McKay’s directing credits
                          include “Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy,” “Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby,”
                          “Step Brothers,” “The Other Guys” and “Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues.” Wirkola is repped by
                          CAA, Principato-Young Entertainment and attorney Michael Schenkman.

                          ‘Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters’ writer-director Tommy Wirkola will pen the script. Adam McKay is
                          no stranger to superheroes or comic book adaptations. He worked on the script for Ant-Man, he's
                          working on the sequel Ant-Man and the Wasp, and he long circled an adaptation of Garth Ennis’ The
                          Boys. However, it looks like his directing debut on a superhero film will be for an adaptation of
                          the Mark Waid comic Irredeemable. According to Deadline, McKay has signed on to helm an adaptation
                          of the book, which is about “the Plutonian, the world’s greatest superhero until he began
                          heartlessly slaughtering the population of Earth, at least those who defy him. It falls to a
                          superhero group known as the Paradigm to stop his rampage. They were former colleagues of the
                          Plutonian, they’ve all got problems of their own, and none of them is nearly as powerful as the
                          mass-murdering maniac holding the world hostage. In Clarice-Hannibal Lecter fashion, the Paradigm
                          in desperation turns to a famous supervillain for help; it might be the only way to stop the
                          carnage.” This sounds like a fun premise, and definitely swims in the darkness that McKay has shown
                          he can handle with The Big Short. However, I’m a bit pessimistic on the choice for writing the
                          script.

                          hovering and obstacle avoidance test for the Mars Lander of China's first Mars exploration mission
                          at the extraterrestrial celestial landing test site. It was the first public appearance of China's
                          Mars exploration mission.[46] As the mission preparation proceeded, in April 2020, the mission was
                          formally named "Tianwen-1".[47] On 23 July 2020, Tianwen-1 was launched from Wenchang Spacecraft
                          Launch Site on the island of Hainan atop a Long March 5 heavy-lift launch vehicle.[22] In September

                          understand why. The laptops that schools provide to elementary and middle school kids are famously
                          ugly, old, and terrible in all kinds of ways. With the Surface Laptop SE, which is tailor-made for

                          SE is a cute laptop. It looks like a miniature version of the company’s flagship Surface Laptop
                          line, complete with the recognizable logo on the lid and bottom bezel. It’s quite light, at just
                          2.45 pounds. Unlike many clunky school models out there, this is a device I can easily see
                          appealing to adults in the consumer space. If it weren’t so dang slow. I’m not gonna hold back
                          here: this is the slowest computer I’ve ever used.

                          In a mid-credits scene, Loretta and Alan are shown attending a meditation class where they
                          unexpectedly meet Jack, who is revealed to have somehow survived after being shot in the head, and
                          claims he did so by using a 'different' ten percent of his brain. Additionally, Raymond Lee appears
                          as Officer Gomez, Adam Nee appears as Officer Sawyer, and Stephen Lang (credited as Slang) appears
                          as the fantasy villain imagined by Loretta. In October 2020, it was announced Sandra Bullock would
                          star in the film The Lost City of D, with Aaron and Adam Nee directing from a screenplay by Seth
                          Gordon and Dana Fox, with Bullock serving as a producer under her Fortis Films banner, and
                          Paramount Pictures to distribute.[8] Bullock originally passed on the project because she felt the
                          story was "outdated" due to it being in development for seven years.[9] That December, Channing
                          Tatum was cast as the male lead.[10] Between March and April 2021, Patti Harrison, Da'Vine Joy
                          Randolph, Daniel Radcliffe, Brad Pitt, and Oscar Nunez joined the cast, with Pitt and Lang
                          appearing in cameo roles.[11][12][13][14][15] Principal photography began in May 2021[16] in the
                          Dominican Republic, including Samaná, Santo Domingo, Casa de Campo, Monte Plata Province and
                          Pinewood Dominican Republic Studios.

                          the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences barred Smith from attending any Academy events,
                          including the Oscars, for 10 years. "The Board has decided, for a period of 10 years from April 8,

                          Awards while presenting an award. "I'm going to present this award and I trust that you people will
                          stay 500 feet away from me. Just playing," he told the audience.

                          remarkable M1 chip that debuted in 2020, and it powers Apple's new 13-inch MacBook Air 2022 and
                          MacBook Pro 2022. These are successors to two of the best MacBooks on the market, so it's exciting

  - Source              :
                          Apple in June 2022 unveiled the M2, its next-generation Apple silicon chip that followed the M1
                          chip. This guide highlights everything you need to know about the M2 chip, from performance
                          improvements to extra features. The M2 is Apple's next-generation System on a Chip (SoC) developed
                          for use in Macs and iPads. It marks Apple's continued work to transition away from the Intel chips
                          that were used in Macs up until 2020. As a "System on a Chip," the M2 integrates several different
                          components, including the CPU, GPU, unified memory architecture (RAM), Neural Engine, Secure
                          Enclave, SSD controller, image signal processor, encode/decode engines, Thunderbolt controller with
                          USB 4 support, and more, all of which power the different features in the Mac. Before Apple
                          silicon, Macs used multiple chips for CPU, I/O, and security, but Apple's effort to integrate these
                          chips is the reason why the M2 is much faster and more efficient than Intel chips. The unified
                          memory architecture that Apple has included is also a major factor because all of the technologies
                          in the M2 are able to access the same data without having to swap between multiple pools of memory.
                          Built into the M2 chip, the unified memory architecture means the CPU, GPU, and other processor
                          components don't need to copy data between one another, and are able to access the same data pool.

                          slapped Rock in what at first appeared to be a scripted joke. But the theatre turned sombre moments

                          Tammy Faye Bakker in “The Eyes of Tammy Faye”. In other awards, Jane Campion won the Oscar for best
                          director for her dark Western “Power of the Dog”. Campion, who had been the first woman ever twice
                          nominated in the category (previously for 1993’s “The Piano”), is just the third woman to win best
                          director. It is also the first time the directing award has ever gone to women in back-to-back
                          years after “Nomadland” filmmaker Chloe Zhao won last year.

                          in the first half, France did not record a shot until after the 70th minute but were energised by
                          additional substitutions in the 71st. A few minutes later, France were awarded a penalty as Randal
                          Kolo Muani was brought down in the penalty area by Nicolás Otamendi. Mbappé scored the penalty and
                          added a second goal less than two minutes later to equalise the scores.[247] With the score tied at
                          two goals apiece, the match went to extra time. Messi scored his second goal in the 108th minute,
                          once again giving Argentina the lead. However, Mbappé was awarded a second penalty in the 115th
                          minute after his shot hit the arm of Gonzalo Montiel. Mbappé scored his third goal, becoming the
                          second player ever to complete a hat-trick in the final of a World Cup after Geoff Hurst for
                          England in 1966.[247] With the score tied at 3–3, the match was determined via a penalty shootout.

                          quarter-on-quarter sales growth was modest despite price cuts as rising competition and a bleak
                          economic outlook weighed. Tesla delivered 422,875 vehicles for the first three months of this year,
                          up 4% from the previous quarter. This was 36% higher than a year ago. In January, Chief Executive
                          Elon Musk said Tesla could achieve 2 million vehicle deliveries this year, up 52% from last year.
                          Investors have been watching Musk's gamble that cutting prices would stimulate sales, although they

                          unleashing a price war after missing Wall Street delivery estimates for 2022. The basic Model Y
                          that used to sell for $65,990 now costs $54,990. "If they wouldn't have done the price cut, it
                          would have been ugly. I think what it tells you is the economy is getting tough," Gene Munster,

                          million vehicles, absent external disruption, from 1.3 million in 2022.

Question 50              : How much did Elon Musk bought Twitter?

  - Source              :
                          By Wailin Wong , Darian Woods , Nicky Ouellet , Kate Concannon Yes, Elon Musk is the richest person
                          in the world. But he only used some of his cash to buy Twitter for $44 billion. For the rest of it,
                          he used a tactic called a leveraged buyout and spent $13 billion of borrowed money on the
                          acquisition. And now Twitter—not Elon—is on the hook for that loan. Leveraged buyouts had a heyday
                          in the 1980s, when corporate raiders would use debt to finance purchases of companies with healthy
                          balance sheets. The Twitter acquisition, though, is a whole different beast—and as its employees
                          leave en masse and its ad revenues continue to fall, the banks who put up billions to finance the
                          deal might be second guessing their decision. Carl Tack, who we spoke to for this story, wrote a
                          Substack post on the Twitter buyout aimed at students and young professionals. Listeners may find

                          he used a tactic called a leveraged buyout and spent $13 billion of borrowed money on the
                          acquisition. And now Twitter—not Elon—is on the hook for that loan. Leveraged buyouts had a heyday
                          in the 1980s, when corporate raiders would use debt to finance purchases of companies with healthy
                          balance sheets. The Twitter acquisition, though, is a whole different beast—and as its employees
                          leave en masse and its ad revenues continue to fall, the banks who put up billions to finance the
                          deal might be second guessing their decision. Carl Tack, who we spoke to for this story, wrote a
                          Substack post on the Twitter buyout aimed at students and young professionals. Listeners may find

Question 51              : Who won the 2022 Masters Tournament?
Correct Answers         :  
                          Scottie Scheffler
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prediction (only positive):
  - Answer              : Scottie Scheffler
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          Scottie Scheffler won the 2022 Masters on Sunday following a dominant performance at Augusta
                          National. The world No. 1 finished ahead of Northern Irishman Rory McIlroy to claim his first major
                          title. After two close-range misses on the 18th green, he rolled home the winning putt and carded a
                          final round one-under par 71 to finish on 10-under for the tournament, three shots ahead of
                          second-placed McIlroy. Over the four days at the lush, sprawling golf club in Augusta, Georgia,
                          Scheffler produced some excellent golf, refusing to falter under the pressure of being the
                          tournament’s leader for nearly three days. In the end, he was rewarded for his recent run of good
                          form, winning the most prestigious tournament title out there, as well as going home with the
                          famous green jacket and the $2.7 million winners purse. Asked how he felt in the immediate
                          aftermath, Scheffler said he was “pretty tired.” “I want to go home! I’m pretty tired right now –
                          I’m really at a loss for words right now,” he said. “I can’t thank my family enough – they’ve made
                          many sacrifices over the years. To have the honor of winning the tournament and to have my family
                          with me was incredible.” The last two months have been transformative for Scheffler.

                          Over the next several hours, Scheffler, 25, rebuffed every challenge with the same aplomb to claim
                          his first major championship, running away to win the 2022 Masters by three strokes. His margin of
                          victory would have been larger but for a final show of some nerves during the tournament’s closing
                          sequence on the 18th green, when Scheffler needed four putts, including three from less than five
                          feet, to close out a round of 71. Scheffler finished 10 under par for the tournament, in just his
                          third Masters appearance. Rory McIlroy, who trailed Scheffler by 10 strokes heading into the final
                          round, finished second after an eight-under-par 64. Smith and Shane Lowry tied for third, five
                          strokes off the lead. Speaking with reporters after donning the ceremonial green jacket awarded to
                          Masters winners, Scheffler talked of feeling calm on the course during the final round but said he
                          was “so stressed out” on Sunday morning. “I cried like a baby,” he said. “I was so overwhelmed.”
                          Scheffler added that he told his wife, Meredith, “I don’t think I’m ready for this.” Scheffler said
                          he could not recall any previous episodes of self-doubt and attributed it to an understanding of
                          how much winning the Masters would mean to him. “I’ve felt at peace on the golf course,” he said,
                          laughing.

Question 52              : Who won the women's singles Australian Open 2022?
Correct Answers         :  
                          Ashleigh Barty
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prediction (only positive):
  - Answer              : Ashleigh Barty
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          The 2022 Australian Open was a Grand Slam tennis tournament that took place at Melbourne Park,
                          Australia from 17 to 30 January 2022.[2] It was the 110th edition of the Australian Open, the 54th
                          in the Open Era, and the first Grand Slam of the year. The tournament consisted of events for
                          professional players in singles, doubles and mixed doubles. Junior and wheelchair players competed
                          in singles and doubles tournaments. As in previous years, the tournament's main sponsor was Kia.
                          The men's singles title was won by Rafael Nadal, and was Nadal's 21st major title, and his second
                          Australian Open. He defeated second seed Daniil Medvedev in the final, winning in five sets after
                          being two sets down. In winning the title, Nadal broke the record for all-time men's major singles
                          title - it was previously tied at 20 between himself, Novak Djokovic, and Roger Federer. The
                          women's singles title was won by Ashleigh Barty, who won her first Australian Open title and third
                          major title. She defeated 27th seed Danielle Collins in straight sets. Barty was the first
                          Australian to win the title since Chris O'Neil won the title in 1978. The final would also prove to
                          be Barty's last professional match, with Barty announcing her retirement in March 2022.

                          Aryna Sabalenka defeated Elena Rybakina in the final, 4–6, 6–3, 6–4 to win the women's singles
                          tennis title at the 2023 Australian Open. It was her first major singles title.[1] Sabalenka
                          dropped just one set during the tournament, to Rybakina in the championship match. Rybakina became
                          the first Kazakhstani player to progress past the fourth round, and the first player since Jennifer
                          Capriati in 2001 to defeat three consecutive major champions in a single edition of the Australian
                          Open.[2] By reaching the final, Rybakina made her debut in the top ten of the WTA Rankings.
                          Ashleigh Barty was the reigning champion,[3] but she retired from professional tennis in March
                          2022.[4] Barty's retirement and Angelique Kerber and Naomi Osaka’s absences (both due to pregnancy)
                          meant that Victoria Azarenka and Sofia Kenin were the only former champions left in the draw. They
                          met in the first round, with Azarenka winning in straight sets.[5] Jeļena Ostapenko became the

                          Rybakina manages to hold with a service winner down the T. A one-set shoot-off to decide the winner
                          of the 2023 Australian Open. There could not have been a better script. Sabalenka* 6-3 Rybakina -
                          Wide second serve into the deuce court from Sabalenka and forehand return from Rybakina is long.
                          Deep backhand crosscourt return from Rybakina draws a shot ball from Sabalenka and Rybakina
                          finishes the point with a crosscourt forehand winner - 15-all. Wide serve into the deuce court and
                          yet again, Rybakina’s forehand return is beyond the baseline. Rybakina reads the crosscourt drop
                          shot from Sabalenka and finishes the point with a backhand winner down the line - 30-all. A T ace
                          from Sabalenka and she has her third set point. A T ace on second serve and Sabalenka wins second
                          set 6-3! Sabalenka 5-3 Rybakina* - Rybakina serving to stay in the set. The Kazakh misses the inner
                          sideline by a whisker as she goes for an inside-out backhand. Deep backhand return from Sabalenka
                          and Rybakina’s backhand in reply is well long.

                          Djokovic's status for the French Open (along with the other Grand Slams) is still in doubt due to
                          his refusal to get the COVID-19 vaccination. Federer, meanwhile, has yet to make his return to the
                          court in 2022 following knee surgery in August 2021. With Nadal's second Australian Open title, he
                          breaks the Open Era record for the longest span between first and second title at the same Grand
                          Slam at 13 years apart. Nadal won his first Australian Open title in 2009, in a 4-hour and 23
                          minute five-set match against Roger Federer. Prior, Jimmy Connors held the men's record at eight
                          years apart (Wimbledon 1974 and 1982). Nadal also becomes just the fourth man in the Open Era to

                          No. 114. He is a brilliant player, and if he puts his mind to it, there are very few opponents who
                          can stop him. He had a breakthrough year in 2022. He won the Australian Open doubles with Thanasi
                          Kokkinakis then made the Wimbledon singles final, where he famously wore his red hat to the awards
                          ceremony. He followed it up with singles and doubles victories at the Citi Open. And who can forget
                          the tactically brilliant four-set win against Medvedev in the fourth round of the US Open last
                          year? The Australian Open is his home Slam too, so he might not stop until he wins the whole thing
                          -- and then, who knows, he might just retire, as he keeps hinting. Maine: Those who were paying
                          close attention in 2022 might not be surprised by this, especially not after the fourth-round
                          challenge she presented to Swiatek at the French Open, but Qinwen Zheng seems poised for another
                          huge year, and it feels like that could start in Melbourne.

                          though her ambitions make it so difficult. She has been frank about the possible outcomes here,
                          including the fact that losing is an option that should be prepared for, one that would not be a
                          tragedy. Quite the final we have on Philippe Chatrier today, a battle between an irresistible force
                          in Iga Swiatek and irresistible charm in Coco Gauff. It’s also a battle between two members of the
                          younger generation on the women’s tour. Swiatek, the 2020 French Open champion, while Gauff is
                          still just 18, having charmed the tennis world in 2018 with her Wimbledon run. It’s her first grand
                          slam final, though she has also reached the women’s doubles final this year at Roland Garros. To
                          land the French title, Gauff must beat a player on a 34-match winning streak, going for a sixth
                          title in succession, and therefore upset the odds, though she has yet to drop a set this year in
                          Paris. This could be a classic, and three sets of tennis must be expected. We start at 2pm UK time.

                          season.[2] Świątek also became the youngest winner of multiple majors since Maria Sharapova in
                          2006.[3] Barbora Krejčíková was the defending champion,[4] but she lost in the first round to Diane

                          how this match -- and her run to the final -- has helped boost her confidence. "For a while I
                          really believed I couldn't do it just because ever since I was 15 and I first came on people had so
                          much expectations for me and I started to believe that I couldn't do it and you know I made a final

                          come out on top next time. The numbers tell the story of a dominant and composed match for Swiatek
                          -- which was the story of her tournament and could be the tag line for her last three months of
                          tennis. 73% first serves in, 72% win rate on first serves, 5-for-10 in break point chances, just 16

                          46% of her first serve points and coming away with three double faults and 23 unforced errors and
                          21 forced errors. The next big tournament on the tennis calendar is Wimbledon, which starts June

                          second as Jabeur battled back from a service break down twice to get the set into a tiebreaker
                          before Swiatek ultimately prevailed. Swiatek, 21, won the French Open in 2020 and 2022, becoming

                          (AP) — Marketa Vondrousova came to the All England Club a year ago unable to play tennis at all.
                          She had a cast on her surgically repaired left wrist, so her visit was limited to sightseeing
                          around London with her sister and cheering for a friend who was competing at Wimbledon. This trip
                          was a lot more memorable: She is leaving as a Grand Slam champion. Vondrousova became the first
                          unseeded woman to win Wimbledon on Saturday, coming back in each set for a 6-4, 6-4 victory over
                          2022 runner-up Ons Jabeur in the final.

                          playing — a reminder of days practicing at indoor courts during winters in Prague. “I always play
                          good indoors,” Vondrousova said. “I was like, ‘Yeah, maybe that’s going to help me.’” On this
                          afternoon, she trailed in each set but collected the last four games of the first, then the last
                          three games of the second as Jabeur fell to 0-3 in major finals. The 28-year-old from Tunisia is
                          the only Arab woman and only North African woman to make it that far in singles at any Grand Slam
                          tournament. “You cannot force things,” the sixth-seeded Jabeur said. “It wasn’t meant to be.” She
                          lost to Elena Rybakina 12 months ago at the All England Club and to No. 1 Iga Swiatek at the U.S.
                          Open last September. “I think this is the most painful loss of my career,” Jabeur said Saturday,
                          pausing to wipe away tears. Vondrousova’s surge to her Slam title was hard to envision at the start
                          of this fortnight. She was 1-4 in previous appearances on Wimbledon’s grass, only once making it as
                          far as the second round, before going 7-0 on a run that included wins against five seeded foes.

                          his 32nd men's singles major final, he surpassed the all-time record he had jointly held with Roger
                          Federer.[3] Djokovic also became the first player (male or female) to win 80 matches at all four
                          majors with his first-round win over Kwon Soon-woo.[4] Because no ranking points were awarded for
                          the tournament in response to its banning of Russian and Belarusian players, Djokovic dropped out
                          of the top five in ATP rankings after the tournament.[5] Kyrgios became the first unseeded man to
                          reach a major final since Jo-Wilfried Tsonga at the 2008 Australian Open, the first Australian man
                          to reach a major final since Lleyton Hewitt at the 2005 Australian Open, and the first unseeded or
                          Australian man to reach the Wimbledon final since Mark Philippoussis in 2003.[6]

Question 68              : Who is the new head coach of the Virginia Tech football team in 2022?
Correct Answers         :  
                          Brent Pry

                          64 BLACKSBURG, Va. — Amid the excitement and fanfare of a new head coach comes an uncomfortable
                          side of things too. The previous regime at Virginia Tech wasn’t cutting it, nor were some of the
                          players. It’s how a program once revered for its consistent ability to win 10 games a year finishes
                          under .500 in three of the past four seasons. Advertisement So for new Hokies head coach Brent Pry,
                          chief among his tasks is to be open and honest with players about where they fit in the new world
                          order, what their role is and, in some cases, whether he thinks they’re good enough to play at
                          Virginia Tech. “We can’t be afraid of hard conversations,” Pry said. “Everybody in here has
                          weaknesses, including myself. It’s about staring at those head-on and addressing them and let’s go
                          work through them and strengthen them.” In that spirit, here’s a hard conversation for Hokies fans:
                          This season could be a rough one. That’s not a commentary on Pry’s long-term viability as Tech’s
                          coach. The early returns seem positive, with Pry saying and doing all the right things and sowing
                          the seeds with how he and his staff are re-establishing themselves in the state on the recruiting
                          trail after many of those relationships atrophied in the Justin Fuente era. But this roster isn’t
                          in a quick-fix situation.

                          from Woodbridge used to get asked when strolling through campus or nearby neighborhoods how
                          relatable Fuente was to his players, with fans expressing their distaste for the former coach.
                          “That’s one thing I thought was crazy because last year, the year before, we would walk around, and
                          people would be like: ‘Do you like Fuente? Because I don’t,’ ” Dzansi said. “And now it’s like:
                          ‘Oh, how do you like Coach Pry? Because we love him.’ It’s so different. It’s such a big

                          been only Pry’s vibrant personality that has energized the Hokies, who last season finished 12th

                          to see what the collective cigar media had to say.

Question 70              : When did the 148th Kentucky Derby take place?

                          The 2022 Kentucky Derby (officially, the 148th Running of the Kentucky Derby Presented by Woodford
                          Reserve[1]) took place on Saturday, May 7, 2022, at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky. It was
                          the 148th running of the Kentucky Derby, a 1+1⁄4 miles (2.0 km) Grade I stakes race for
                          three-year-old Thoroughbreds. The Derby is held annually at Churchill Downs on the first Saturday
                          in May since its inception in 1875. The 20 horses that ran in the Derby qualified by earning points
                          in the 2022 Road to the Kentucky Derby. The two favorites for the 2022 Kentucky Derby were
                          Epicenter, the winner of the Louisiana Derby, and Zandon, the winner of the Blue Grass Stakes. Both
                          horses finished behind winner Rich Strike, who had only entered the race after a late scratch.
                          Entering the race at odds of 80–1, Rich Strike's victory was the second-largest upset in Derby
                          history. It was the first Kentucky Derby victory for his trainer Eric Reed, as well as the first
                          graded stakes win in any race for his jockey Sonny Leon. Participation in the Kentucky Derby is
                          restricted to three-year-old Thoroughbreds.

                          Only three horses in the Derby had previously raced on an "off" track, and such precipitation had
                          the chance to alter the race dynamics.[36] However, the rain held off. By the time horses reached
                          the post, the weather at Churchill Downs was 62 °F (17 °C) with cloudy skies and 10 mph (16 km/h)
                          winds. The track condition was listed as fast.[37] The listed attendance for the 2022 Kentucky
                          Derby was 147,294.[38] This was an increase over the previous year, when ticket sales were
                          restricted due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, but below the expected crowd of
                          170,000.[39][40] Coverage of the Derby was broadcast on USA Network from noon to 2:30 p.m. (ET) and
                          then moved to NBC until 7:30 p.m. (ET). The race was also broadcast online through Peacock,
                          NBCSports.com, and the NBC Sports app.[6] Summer is Tomorrow took an early lead out of the gates,
                          setting a Derby record by running the first quarter-mile in 21.78 seconds.[41][42] Crown Pride kept
                          apace with Summer is Tomorrow through the first half-mile, run in 45.36 seconds, with Messier
                          following close behind.[43] Messier took the lead at the 3⁄4-mile mark but was soon overtaken by
                          Epicenter at the head of the stretch.

                          The initial months of 2021 were not favorable for automakers. Semiconductor shortages derailed the
                          post-COVID recovery, affecting vehicle sales worldwide. But the shortages have eased a bit one year
                          later and auto sales are reviving. Automakers expect to recover the losses made during the last two
                          years, soon. However, traditional automakers are unable to cope with the rising demand for pure
                          EVs, whereas Tesla’s ability to address this demand has rewarded it not only with higher vehicle
                          sales in Q1 2022 but also a record revenue of $18.8 billion. Tesla has also started deliveries to
                          car rental service provider Hertz against its huge 100,000-vehicle order, which is also a reason
                          for high vehicle production and delivery during the quarter. Tesla’s Q1 2022 revenue would have
                          been more without the fresh COVID wave that has hit Shanghai and surrounding areas, affecting the
                          company’s production there. From the second week of March, rising cases of a new COVID variant have
                          forced automakers operating around Shanghai to suspend production. The urge to achieve L4 autonomy
                          by the end of 2023 and to roll out robotaxis by early 2025 can be a major reason for Tesla’s big
                          R&D spend. Besides, Tesla could also be conducting research on developing new battery chemistry.
                          The soaring prices of some key battery components like nickel and lithium have put the auto OEMs in
                          a spot.

                          However, the company has faced numerous challenges due to global supply chain disruptions. Those
                          challenges, which include the global semiconductor shortage, continue to persist. Tesla was even
                          forced to shutter its Shanghai factory in late March due to an outbreak of COVID-19 in the region.
                          The company began preparing to reopen the plant earlier this week. However, the reopening will be
                          under modified conditions where workers will have to live onsite to comply with China's "closed
                          loop management" process for limiting the spread of the coronavirus. Tesla said that it has made
                          adjustments to its product pricing due to inflationary pressures on its cost structure. However, it
                          has been able to reduce its cost of goods sold (COGS) per vehicle despite the inflationary
                          pressures. That helped to drive its profitability during the quarter. During an earnings call after
                          results were announced, Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Zachary Kirkhorn and Chief Executive Officer
                          (CEO) Elon Musk said the company remains confident that it can increase volume at least 50%
                          compared to 2021 numbers. However, the executives said that Tesla has lost about a month of “build
                          volume” in Shanghai in the wake of shutdowns imposed by China's central government due to the
                          increase in COVID-19 cases. “Production is resuming at limited levels, and we’re working to get
                          back to full production as quickly as possible,” Kirkhorn said.

                          publishing and master rights.” Since launching just 14 months ago, Multimedia Music has spent more
                          than $120 million on acquisitions. Among those deals was the purchase of the catalog of composer
                          James Newton Howard, included scores for the “Hunger Games” trilogy, “The Dark Knight,”
                          “Maleficent,” “Snow White and the Huntsman,” “King Kong,” “Emily in Paris” and “Pretty Woman.”
                          Multimedia Music also took the master and publishing rights to a 48-title film score catalog from
                          Atlantic Screen Music in a mid-seven figure transaction that included rights to the scores from

                          Discovery head of streaming JB Perrette and now-CNN Chief Operating Officer David Leavy, were
                          skeptical of spending hundreds of millions of dollars on niche or half-baked content ideas like
                          "Jake Tapper's Book Club" and "Parental Guidance with Anderson Cooper." Leavy is now part of the
                          executive team that will help Zaslav find a new CEO. Zaslav thought CNN+ was a waste of resources
                          for a company saddled with $50 billion of debt that needed to boost free cash flow and generate $3
                          billion in merger-related synergies. But before he made any decisions, he wanted to hear Licht's
                          thoughts. Licht was supposed to begin his job May 2, 2022, but he started a few weeks early to
                          weigh in on CNN+. In several virtual conferences, he met with CNN+ head Andrew Morse, CNN+ general
                          manager Alex MacCallum and CNN Chief Tech Officer Robyn Peterson, according to people familiar with
                          the matter who declined to be identified due to the private nature of the talks. Perrette and
                          Discovery streaming CFO Neil Chugani (who would become CNN's CFO) were also there. Licht expressed
                          his skepticism with the product's programming, according to people in the meeting. The discussion
                          centered around the viability of offering a product named after CNN without actually featuring a
                          live feed of the network's cable programming. Perrette told the CNN+ leadership to pause all
                          marketing spending and not to launch on Roku.

Question 77              : What is the megapixel in main camera on the iPhone 14 Pro?

                          Well ahead of Apple’s event last month, there had been rumors that this long era — 7 years is a
                          practical century in technology time — was about to come to an end. Indeed, iPhone 14 Pro was
                          announced with a 48 megapixel camera. Looking purely at the specs, it’s an impressive upgrade: the
                          sensor is significantly larger in size, not just resolution. The lens is slightly slower (that is,
                          its aperture isn’t quite as large as the previous years’) but once again, the overall
                          light-gathering ability of the iPhone’s main shooter improves by as much as 33%. The implications
                          are clear: more pixels for more resolution; more light gathered for better low light shots, and
                          finally, a bigger sensor for improvements in all areas including more shallow depth of field.
                          There’s a reason we chase the dragon of larger sensors in cameras; they allow for all our favorite
                          photography subjects: details, low light and night shots, and nice bokeh. Your average digital
                          camera sensor has a particularly interesting way to capture color. We’ve previously detailed this
                          in our post about ProRAW, which you can read here, but we’ll quickly go over it again. Essentially,
                          a camera sensor contains tiny pixels that can detect how much light comes in. For a dark area of an
                          image, it will register darkness accurately, and vice versa for lighter areas.

                          Apple did not go into great detail about the camera hardware changes here, but thankfully
                          Techinsights took the entire camera package apart. The new sensor, at 40mm², is almost 50% larger
                          than the iPhone 13 Pro’s 26.9 mm² sensor. While its aperture is slightly ‘slower’ (that is,
                          smaller) the larger sensor compensates. How does the sensor and lens change stack up in practice?
                          The iPhone 14 Pro easily outperforms the previous iPhone, creating far sharper shots: In multiple
                          shots in various conditions, the shots were far more detailed and exhibited less visible processing
                          than comparable iPhone 13 Pro shots: A nice side benefit of a larger sensor is a bit more shallow
                          depth of field. At a 13mm full-frame equivalent, you really can’t expect too much subject
                          separation, but this shot shows some nice blurry figures in the background. I believe that both
                          Apple’s new Photonic Engine and the larger sensor are contributing to a lot more detail in the
                          frame, which makes a cropped image like the above shot possible. The ‘my point of view’ perspective
                          that the ultra-wide provides puts you in the action, and a lack of detail makes every shot less
                          immersive. Is it all perfect? Well, comparably, with the main camera getting ever-better, it is
                          still fairly soft and lacking detail. Its 12 megapixel resolution is suddenly feeling almost
                          restrictive.

                          submitted by 1 July 2019.[14] While the bidding associations were not confirmed by UEFA, the German

                          awarded the 2021 final.[15] The Allianz Arena was selected by the UEFA Executive Committee during
                          their meeting in Ljubljana, Slovenia, on 24 September 2019,[16] where the hosts for the 2021 and

                          awarded the 2023 final; Munich would host the 2025 final instead.[9] Note: In all results below,

                          All rounds were best-of-seven series; a series ended when one team won four games, and that team
                          advanced to the next round. All rounds, including the NBA Finals, were in a 2–2–1–1–1 format with
                          regards to hosting. In the conference playoffs, home court advantage went to the higher-seeded team
                          (number one being the highest). Conference seedings were ignored for the NBA Finals: home court
                          advantage went to the team with the better regular season record, and, if needed, ties were broken
                          based on head-to-head record, followed by intra-conference record. On March 9, 2022, the Phoenix
                          Suns became the first team to clinch a playoff spot.[13] On April 5, the San Antonio Spurs and New
                          Orleans Pelicans became the last two teams to qualify for postseason play, as both teams secured
                          spots in the first-stage play-in tournament. On April 7, the Denver Nuggets became the final team
                          to secure a direct berth in the playoff bracket, qualifying as the sixth seed in the Western
                          Conference and relegating the Minnesota Timberwolves to the play-in tournament.[14] While noted in
                          the below tables, division titles have no bearing on seeding.[15] Seeds 7 and 8 in each conference
                          were determined via the first-stage play-in tournament, held April 12–15.

                          These missions are only available as free-to-play game modes during specific seasons, but Blizzard
                          will offer to buy permanent access to these missions separately or as part of a battle pass
                          bundle.[11] Overwatch 2 was announced at BlizzCon on November 1, 2019, with plans that the game
                          would maintain a "shared multiplayer environment" between it and the original Overwatch, so that
                          players in either game could compete in the existing player versus player (PvP) game modes,
                          retaining all unlocked cosmetics and other features.[12] Jeff Kaplan, director for Overwatch,
                          explained that this was a major decision and that he had to justify this "player-first standpoint"
                          to Blizzard executives, given the current industry trend to draw in new sales.[13] All new heroes,
                          maps, and PvP modes were to be added to both games to maintain this shared environment.[14]
                          However, Overwatch 2 was later announced as a free-to-play title, and that on its release on
                          October 4, 2022, Blizzard affirmed that Overwatch 2 live services would replace those of the
                          original game; the original Overwatch servers would be shut down on October 2, 2022.[15] Players
                          retained their existing cosmetics and in-game currency, with remaining loot boxes opened
                          automatically upon the release of Overwatch 2.

Question 85              : How much was Apple's revenue in Q3? 2022
Correct Answers         :  
                          83 billion, 83.0 billion

                          Apple today officially reported its earnings for the third fiscal quarter of 2022, covering the
                          second calendar quarter and the months of April, May, and June. A lot of eyes are on Apple as
                          concerns mount over an economic downturn in the United States. Here’s what the company reported
                          today. For Q3 2022, Apple reported revenue of $83.0 billion and a profit of $19.4 billion.
                          Earnings-per-share hit $1.20 for the quarter. For Q3 2022, analyst predictions for revenue varied;
                          $79.26B at the low end to $88.41B at the high end. The average across 26 analysts, however, was
                          $82.81 billion. Apple had not provided any guidance for Q3 2022, citing ongoing supply chain issues
                          and continued disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, the company had even warned
                          that supply constraints would cost it somewhere in the range of $4 billion to $8 billion in revenue
                          for the quarter. For comparison’s sake, in the same quarter a year ago, Apple reported $81.43
                          billion in revenue and profit of $21.74 billion. It reported earnings-per-share of $1.30. These
                          numbers were boosted heavily by pandemic-induced spending, driven by strong iPad and Mac revenue
                          growth. Apple no longer reports unit sales for any of its products but instead reports a breakdown
                          of revenue by product category.

                          including leaders like Apple — is headed for a period of slow or no growth. Cook told CNBC that the

                          structure," Cook said. "We see it in things like logistics and wages and certain silicon components
                          and we're still hiring, but we're doing it on a deliberate basis." Apple's iPhone sales exceeded
                          Wall Street expectations, suggesting that demand for iPhone 13 models remains strong even in the

                          Amazon said its cloud-computing division Amazon Web Services (AWS) posted 33 percent increase in
                          its revenue to $19.7 billion in the second quarter of 2022. AWS has generated operating income of
                          $5.71 billion in Q2. Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky said on an analyst call that a downturn in 2008
                          resulted in companies choosing to use Amazon’s cloud services rather than build their own data
                          centers, giving AWS a boost. Rival Microsoft said earlier this week that its fiscal-year revenue

                          Amazon said its cloud-computing division Amazon Web Services (AWS) posted 33 percent increase in
                          its revenue to $19.7 billion in the second quarter of 2022. AWS has generated operating income of
                          $5.71 billion in Q2. Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky said on an analyst call that a downturn in 2008
                          resulted in companies choosing to use Amazon’s cloud services rather than build their own data
                          centers, giving AWS a boost. Rival Microsoft said earlier this week that its fiscal-year revenue

  - Answer              : Sallie Gardner
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          As Emerald recounts early in the film, the very first moving picture was created from photos of a
                          man galloping on a horse, specifically a Black jockey whose name has been lost to — or erased from
                          — history, depending on your perspective. The horse was named Sallie Gardner. Horses have had a
                          long and rocky history in Hollywood. Early Hollywood films put horses through gruelling working
                          conditions, often resulting in injury or death. They were essentially treated as disposable. Now
                          on-set animal action, in the United States at least, is monitored by the nonprofit American Humane.
                          Plus, animals on screen are increasingly computer-generated images or motion capture marvels that
                          fuse digital imagery with human actors, as was the case in the award-winning rebooted Planet of the
                          Apes trilogy starring Andy Serkis as the lead chimpanzee, Caesar. We have both reformed and
                          replaced animals’ work in the making of entertainment. Horses and chimpanzees are now often placed
                          on opposite sides of a perceived line between accepted and unacceptable animal use. Most horses are
                          domesticated and have worked for humans for thousands of years. Their careers, reproduction and
                          social lives are largely controlled by humans. In contrast, although individual chimpanzees have
                          been held captive, their species remains wild.

Question 91              : Who is the lead actor in the film Carter?
Correct Answers         :  
                          Joo Won
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prediction (only positive):
  - Answer              : Joo Won
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          Here's a guide to that cast and characters they play in Carter, and what they've been in before.
                          Heading up the cast is Joo Won as Carter Lee, later revealed as also going by the name Michael
                          Bane. The film begins with Carter waking up in a blood-soaked bed in Seoul with a cross-shaped scar
                          on the back of his head and no memory of who he is. With a premise similar to Hardcore Henry,
                          Carter also features video game logic in its action sequences. Joo Won is a South Korean actor best
                          known for his roles in television, including the main protagonist in Good Doctor, which is played
                          by Freddie Highmore in the American adaptation. Kim Jong-hyeok is a North Korean General who meets
                          Carter during his mission, providing him transport out of South Korea. General Kim is played by Lee
                          Sung-jae, a veteran South Korean actor with credits in TV and film. Lee’s most notable credit is
                          Barking Dogs Never Bite, a 2000 dark comedy film that was the directorial debut of Bong Joon-ho,
                          whose film Parasite won the 2020 Oscar for Best Picture. The young girl cured of the virus and
                          carrying the life-saving antibodies is Jung Ha-na (Kim Bo-min). Carter is tasked with rescuing
                          Ha-na and bringing her to a North Korean facility where the production of a vaccine can be
                          developed.

                          Now streaming on: Samuel L. Jackson made news last week by refusing to co-star with 50 Cent in a
                          movie based on the rapper's life. He not only refused, but did it publicly, even though the film is
                          to be directed by six-time Oscar nominee Jim Sheridan ("In America"). A clue to Jackson's thinking
                          may be found in his new film, "Coach Carter," based on the true story of a California high school
                          basketball coach who placed grades ahead of sports. Like Bill Cosby, Jackson is arguing against the
                          anti-intellectual message that success for young black males is better sought in the worlds of rap
                          and sports than in the classroom. There is however another aspect to Jackson's refusal: He said he
                          thought Sheridan wanted him to "lend legitimacy" to 50 Cent's acting debut. He might have something
                          there. Jackson has an authority on the screen; he occupies a character with compelling force,
                          commanding attention and can bring class to a movie. He might, he said, be interested in working
                          with 50 Cent after the rapper makes another five movies or so, and earns his chops. This reasoning
                          may not be fair. Consider the work that Ice Cube did in "Boyz N the Hood" (1991), his first movie
                          and the beginning of a successful acting career. Or look at the promise that Tupac Shakur showed,
                          especially in his last feature, "Gridlock'd" (1997), holding his own with the veteran Tim Roth.

                          Here's a guide to that cast and characters they play in Carter, and what they've been in before.
                          Heading up the cast is Joo Won as Carter Lee, later revealed as also going by the name Michael
                          Bane. The film begins with Carter waking up in a blood-soaked bed in Seoul with a cross-shaped scar
                          on the back of his head and no memory of who he is. With a premise similar to Hardcore Henry,
                          Carter also features video game logic in its action sequences. Joo Won is a South Korean actor best
                          known for his roles in television, including the main protagonist in Good Doctor, which is played
                          by Freddie Highmore in the American adaptation. Kim Jong-hyeok is a North Korean General who meets
                          Carter during his mission, providing him transport out of South Korea. General Kim is played by Lee
                          Sung-jae, a veteran South Korean actor with credits in TV and film. Lee’s most notable credit is
                          Barking Dogs Never Bite, a 2000 dark comedy film that was the directorial debut of Bong Joon-ho,
                          whose film Parasite won the 2020 Oscar for Best Picture. The young girl cured of the virus and
                          carrying the life-saving antibodies is Jung Ha-na (Kim Bo-min). Carter is tasked with rescuing
                          Ha-na and bringing her to a North Korean facility where the production of a vaccine can be
                          developed.

                          the OPT-175B language model (which is 58x the size of Blender Bot 2), and has long-term memory. It
                          also eliminates the limitations such as forgetfulness (which surprisingly makes machine learning
                          models efficient when not used in chatbots). It has self-learning capabilities that allow it “to
                          improve its conversational skills and safety through feedback from people who chat with it,
                          focusing on helpful feedback while avoiding learning from unhelpful or dangerous responses.” Well,
                          yes and no. While it is entirely plausible that the underlying AI tech helps it to ‘learn,’ it
                          seems like Blender Bot 3 cannot differentiate between what is acceptable and what is not. At least
                          that’s what its recent responses to some people conveyed.

                          GPT3 and OPT-175B are working language models, intended to be used – among other things – for
                          serious commercial enterprises. BlenderBot 3, though, is a bit of a laugh. Hence those open
                          questions about safety. Within a few days of BlenderBot being online and ready to mingle (with
                          Americans only, alas), users were posting some spicy examples of the chatbot’s output. The Wall
                          Street Journal’s Jeff Horwitz found that the bot appeared to have been radicalised by Facebook into
                          supporting Donald Trump as a three-term president: And into bringing antisemitic conspiracy
                          theories up, unprompted: Renee DiResta of the Stanford Internet Observatory found that the bot
                          would claim to be an a supporter of the German paramilitary organisation the Red Army Faction:
                          Pranav Dixit of BuzzFeed News found the bot wants to send Zuckerberg to jail: The whole thing is
                          most reminiscent of Tay, Microsoft’s AI-based learning chatbot, which was released in 2016 and
                          promptly became a Hitler-loving Trump supporter: ‘Tay is designed to engage and entertain people
                          where they connect with each other online through casual and playful conversation,’ Microsoft said.
                          ‘The more you chat with Tay the smarter she gets.’ But it appeared on Thursday that Tay’s
                          conversation extended to racist, inflammatory and political statements.

                          Facebook’s parent company has created a bot capable of weighing in on almost any topic – from
                          radicalisation to sending Mark Zuckerberg to jail Last week, researchers at Facebook’s parent
                          company Meta released BlenderBot 3, a “publicly available chatbot that improves its skills and
                          safety over time”. The chatbot is built on top of Meta’s OPT-175B language model, effectively the
                          company’s white-label version of the more famous GPT-3 AI. Like most state-of-the-art AIs these
                          days, that was trained on a vast corpus of text scraped from the internet in questionable ways, and
                          poured into a datacentre with thousands of expensive chips that turned the text into something
                          approaching coherence. But where OPT-175B is a general-purpose textbot, able to do anything from
                          write fiction and answer questions to generate spam emails, BlenderBot 3 is a narrower project: it
                          can have a conversation with you. That focus allows it to bring in other expertise, though, and one
                          of Meta’s most significant successes is hooking the language model up to the broader internet. In
                          other words: “BlenderBot 3 is capable of searching the internet to chat about virtually any topic.”
                          On top of that, BlenderBot is designed to improve itself through feedback on earlier conversations,
                          whereas large language models like OPT-175B are generally fairly static.

                          Share The day for the release of GPT-4 is getting closer. GPT-3 was announced in May 2020, almost
                          two years ago. It was released one year after GPT-2 — which was also released a year after the
                          original GPT paper was published. If this trend were to hold across versions, GPT-4 should already
                          be here. It’s not, but OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, said a few months ago that GPT-4 is coming.
                          Current estimates forecast the release date sometime in 2022, likely around July-August. Despite
                          being one of the most awaited AI news, there’s little public info about GPT-4: what it’ll be like,
                          its features, or its abilities. Altman conducted a Q&A last year and gave a few hints on OpenAI’s
                          ideas for GPT-4 (he asked participants to be discrete about the info, and I’ve been silent — but
                          seven months is a reasonable time margin). One thing he said for sure is that GPT-4 won’t have 100T
                          parameters, as I hypothesized in a previous article (such a big model will have to wait). It’s been
                          some time since OpenAI revealed any info on GPT-4.

                          MLB at Field of Dreams is a recurring Major League Baseball (MLB) regular-season game played in a
                          ballpark adjacent to Field of Dreams in Dyersville, Iowa, a site popularized by the 1989 baseball
                          film Field of Dreams. The first edition of the game was played on August 12, 2021, with the Chicago
                          White Sox defeating the New York Yankees, 9–8. The second edition of the game was played August 11,
                          2022, with the Chicago Cubs defeating the Cincinnati Reds, 4–2. Both games were held on the second
                          Thursday of August. Future games are on hold while a new youth baseball and softball complex is
                          under construction at the Field of Dreams site. The first edition of the game was planned for
                          August 13, 2020, with the Chicago White Sox facing the New York Yankees.[1] However, due to the
                          COVID-19 pandemic, MLB implemented a shortened 2020 season that limited games played to each team's
                          division and the opposite league's geographically equal division to reduce travel. Hence, on July
                          1, MLB announced that the St. Louis Cardinals would replace the Yankees for the game.[2] After
                          several St. Louis players and coaches tested positive for COVID-19 in late July, MLB postponed
                          several Cardinals games, eventually leading the league to announce on August 3 that the MLB at
                          Field of Dreams game would be postponed to the 2021 season.

                          Cedar Rapids Bunnies, respectively.[32] MLB will not host a game at the ballpark in 2023 due to
                          construction around the site.[34] Future plans include converting the site into a youth baseball
                          and softball complex that one day would also have a hotel.[35] Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds confirmed
                          that there will be another round of public funding to build a permanent stadium at the site.[36]

                          By Susan Bradley, Contributing Writer, Computerworld | Windows 11 22H2, released two weeks ago, is
                          another step closer to being an acceptable upgrade to Windows 10. But many Windows users aren't yet
                          being offered it for download. It's important to understand that we're in the “seeker” era for
                          Windows 11 22H2. Microsoft still has a variety of hardware and third-party issues to work through,
                          which is why you might not get offered 22H2 right away. But there is a mechanism you can use to
                          review any hard blocks on your system. (If you want to get 22H2 sooner rather than later, you could
                          opt into the Insider release track, which ensures you get the beta versions of Windows 11 — but
                          that also exposes your hardware to possible bugs, side effects, and other issues.) Courtesy of Adam
                          Gross, you can use a GitHub script to determine exactly why your system is not being offered 22H2.
                          You can either download the PowerShell script from the Github site or follow these commands to
                          determine what might be blocking Windows 11 22H@ from showing up on your hardware.. First, search
                          for PowerShell and then right-mouse click and run as administrator. In an administrator PowerShell
                          session, type in the following: Install-Module FU.

                          works. Everything we know about AMD's new desktop processors Editor's Note: AMD unveiled a few new
                          CPUs in the Ryzen 7000 line at CES 2023, most notably the Ryzen 7040, the first (and so far only)
                          laptop CPU in the lineup -- and the first AMD laptop CPU to ship with onboard Ryzen AI tech. The
                          AMD Ryzen 7000 desktop processors have arrived. AMD announced the pricing and availability of its
                          upcoming Zen 4 architecture-based CPUs during the company's “Together we advance PCs” live stream
                          in August 2022. As previously revealed during Computex 2022, the new chips will feature TSMC's
                          5-nanometer process and run on AMD's new AM5 platform. AMD released four Ryzen 7000 series CPUs on
                          September 27, 2022. As it did with the previous Ryzen 5000 chips, the company plans to release the
                          higher-end (i.e. more expensive) CPUs first and then follow up with more budget processors later
                          this year. Prices for the initial crop of CPUs ranges from $299 to $699. Here's everything you need
                          to know about the new AMD Ryzen 7000 processors. AMD’s Ryzen 7000 series processors will launch on
                          September 27, 2022. The line will consist of four CPUs.

Question 101              : What is the new price of Tesla's Full-Self Driving (FSD) software?

                          much more. Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO. Tesla’s increasing the price of its
                          Full-Self Driving (FSD) software to $15,000. In a post on Twitter, Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced
                          that the new price will go into effect in North America starting September 5th, representing a
                          $3,000 jump. Drivers who order a vehicle before September 5th won’t have to pay the newly-increased
                          price, Musk says. The price hike comes as Tesla begins rolling out FSD beta 10.69 to drivers, a
                          version Musk calls “a big step forward.” It’s still unclear whether Tesla plans on raising the
                          price of its FSD subscription, which currently costs $199 per month. The FSD software lets drivers
                          use Tesla’s advanced driving assistance system (ADAS), Autopilot, to navigate to and from specific
                          destinations, among other driver-assist features. FSD doesn’t make a vehicle fully autonomous; it
                          requires drivers to keep their hands on the wheel and pay attention to the road at all times. The
                          price of Tesla’s FSD beta has slowly crept up over the years, and cost $5,000 upon launch.

                          House of the Dragon premieres Aug. 21 on HBO. It’s been three years since Game Of Thrones ended,
                          and five years since its fandom started complaining bitterly about its final seasons. Spin-off
                          House Of The Dragon therefore debuts to less hype than it might have once had, but really could
                          restore our fascination with Westeros. Immediately, its premiere boasts everything that Thrones did
                          well: an overqualified cast of character actors; backstabbing; sexposition; and lots of dragons.
                          The first proposed spin-off to Game Of Thrones – a Naomi Watts-led adventure set in Westeros’
                          distant past – was ultimately scrapped, reportedly because it was too different from the original
                          show. Perhaps as a result, it sometimes feels like there’s an element of overcorrection here. It’s
                          beautifully rendered - the budget is clearly late-season Game Of Thrones rather than Season 1, and
                          both the Cornish and Spanish locations and the computer-generated dragon flights look magical - but
                          looks and sounds awfully close to its progenitor, down to iconography and locations. That’s not
                          necessarily a bad thing when it comes to the storytelling, since it’s set just far enough in
                          Westeros’ past to keep us guessing, but it speaks of a pervasive timidity in Hollywood to take even
                          the most minor of risks. Still, that’s admittedly more a criticism of this show’s context than its
                          content. Showrunners Ryan J.

                          House of the Dragon premieres Aug. 21 on HBO. It’s been three years since Game Of Thrones ended,
                          and five years since its fandom started complaining bitterly about its final seasons. Spin-off
                          House Of The Dragon therefore debuts to less hype than it might have once had, but really could
                          restore our fascination with Westeros. Immediately, its premiere boasts everything that Thrones did
                          well: an overqualified cast of character actors; backstabbing; sexposition; and lots of dragons.
                          The first proposed spin-off to Game Of Thrones – a Naomi Watts-led adventure set in Westeros’
                          distant past – was ultimately scrapped, reportedly because it was too different from the original
                          show. Perhaps as a result, it sometimes feels like there’s an element of overcorrection here. It’s
                          beautifully rendered - the budget is clearly late-season Game Of Thrones rather than Season 1, and
                          both the Cornish and Spanish locations and the computer-generated dragon flights look magical - but
                          looks and sounds awfully close to its progenitor, down to iconography and locations. That’s not
                          necessarily a bad thing when it comes to the storytelling, since it’s set just far enough in
                          Westeros’ past to keep us guessing, but it speaks of a pervasive timidity in Hollywood to take even
                          the most minor of risks. Still, that’s admittedly more a criticism of this show’s context than its
                          content. Showrunners Ryan J.

                          back in 2016, but luckily the PlayStation VR2 is now here to take the best console VR to the next
                          level. With the PS5 now out worldwide, it’s no surprise that fans have been waiting for a PS VR2
                          headset to go with the new home console. Now we have it – but be warned, it costs more than a PS5
                          itself. If that’s too steep for you, the existing PSVR headset still works with the PlayStation 5,
                          though owners have to request a free adapter to connect the camera to the system. The PS VR2
                          launched worldwide on 22 February 2023, with more than 40 games releasing alongside it in the first
                          month or so. This is the bad news: PS VR2 is expensive. The basic bundle – which includes the
                          headset, a pair of controllers, and stereo headphones – costs $549/£529/€599, which is more than
                          the first PS VR headset launched for, and even more than it costs to buy the PS5 now, which is
                          $499/£479/€549. That’s the cheapest way to buy the new VR headset.

                          Analyst Ross Young claimed that the PSVR2 would not be entering the wild until 2023. Young wrote on
                          Twitter that VR display shipments were to rise in 2022 despite delays to 2023 at Sony.

                          TECH CHECK: McCarley said the idea of using technology to broaden the sport has been the focus of
                          conversations he’s had with Woods and McIlroy over the years, as he and Woods's agent, Mark
                          Steinberg, "have spent hours together over the years talking about how good primetime golf is but
                          how difficult and expensive it is to execute." McCarley: “But the proof is in the ratings every few
                          years when a West Coast event can go late into East Coast prime.” Those conversations became more
                          frequent during the pandemic, particularly with Rob McNamara, EVP of TGR Ventures, which includes
                          PopStroke, Full Swing Golf and TGR Design. Separately, McCarley was having similar conversations
                          with McIlroy and his team. NBC launched GolfPass with McIlroy in 2019, two years before McCarley
                          left the network. “It evolved into how we can harness technology to enhance the experience for both
                          participants who play and for fans,” McCarley said. “We believe there is a difference between
                          following and watching -- so shorter-form experiences are going to be more important as we continue
                          to be crunched for time.” MARKETPLACE OF IDEAS: McCarley bounced the idea off his mentor, Ebersol,
                          who immediately bought into the idea and helped McCarley refine the concept.

                          Your name Your email IDAHO FALLS, Idaho, Sept. 13, 2022 — Super T Transport, Inc. (Super T), one of
                          the fastest-growing trucking fleets in the western United States, is getting even more SUPER. The
                          transportation company recently sold its shares to Berger Logistik, an international transport and
                          logistics company, based out of Austria. Berger Logistik, an enterprise partially owned by Red
                          Bull, will partner with Super T to distribute their products along with Super T’s existing customer
                          base across America. Berger Logistik is a tailor-made logistics service for the entire range of the
                          supply chain including rail, road, ocean, and air transportation. This partnership allows Super T
                          to expand its current network not only in the United States but in Mexico and Canada as well. With
                          the addition of new branches, this acquisition also brings new job opportunities. “We have always
                          been growth-oriented and looking for new opportunities and infrastructure to grow our client base
                          and services,” says Founder and CEO of Super T, Heath Treasure. “While this [partnership] has many

                          and the rest of our Super T family.” Planned business integrations and expansions make this a
                          pivotal time for Super T as it is being launched into the next level of corporate and international
                          business.

                          [Warning: The following contains MAJOR spoilers for The Amazing Race Season 34 premiere, “Many
                          Firsts But Don’t Be Last.”] When you’re 30+ seasons into a show, you’ve got to change things up
                          from time to time. A big new change was revealed in The Amazing Race Season 34 premiere on
                          September 21 on CBS, and it raises the stakes of the fast-paced competition series to new heights.
                          In The Amazing Race Season 34, there will be no non-elimination rounds. If you’re last, you’re cut,
                          and you can’t be saved. The show announced this change ahead of the season premiere, but the
                          contestants had no clue. The paired players learned of this shocking update from host Phil Keoghan
                          outside of Nymphenburg Palace in Munich, Germany, marking another first — the series has always
                          started the seasons somewhere in the United States. Throughout their adventures, the cast will trek
                          through Jordan, Austria, Italy, France, Spain, and Iceland before arriving at the Nashville finish
                          line. Players hardly had any time to process the non-elimination bombshell before it was off to the
                          (many) races. The first leg of the race required players to drive themselves to three different
                          places before finding Phil at the first Pit Stop. This task went off relatively without a hitch for
                          the teams. The next challenge was more physically demanding, requiring contestants to roll a beer
                          keg (when in Germany) through obstacles in one minute.

                          They couldn’t move forward until they successfully got through all the obstacles in that short
                          timeframe. Military brothers Michael and Marcus made quick work of that, nailing it on the second
                          attempt, but others struggled more. Timing is everything in this game, so multiple failed challenge
                          attempts could snowball into eliminations. Up next, the pairs had to saw a log to unlock a clue.
                          The teams deployed different strategies for this. Where some exerted a lot of physical energy,
                          others took a less intense, more careful approach of letting the saw do what it’s made to do.
                          Preserving energy was a good move, as the last challenge required players to chisel through a large
                          block of ice. Kit Karzen/CBS Big Brother alums Derek and Claire (who have been dating since meeting
                          on the show) were the first couple to unlock all three clues, which reveal the next Pit Stop
                          location: Friedensengal, Munich’s Angel of Peace monument. Derek and Claire came in first place,
                          winning them $2,500 each. Newlyweds Glenda and Lumumba placed second, and former Rams cheerleaders
                          Quinton and Mattie placed third. Engaged couple Aastha and Nina came in last, making them the first
                          pair eliminated from The Amazing Race Season 34. The Amazing Race will have a 90-minute episode on
                          September 28, starting at 9:30/8:30c on CBS.

                          Barcelona also faces a ban that could stretch to multiple years if a match-fixing allegation
                          emerges in the so-called “Caso Negreira” case. Any club suspected of fixing just one game since a
                          UEFA rule took effect in 2007 is typically removed from the next European competition. A
                          disciplinary case also is opened that can apply further sanctions. Turkish club Fenerbahce ended up
                          missing three seasons because of fixing allegations in 2011. Milan and Toulouse, owned by RedBird
                          Capital Partners, are not alone facing UEFA questions about multi-club owners having “decisive
                          influence” over two clubs. Brighton and Union Saint-Gilloise have close ties through owner Tony
                          Bloom and both are in the Europa League. Aston Villa’s owners, including Milwaukee Bucks co-owner
                          Wes Edens, have a near-50% stake in Vitória Guimarães of Portugal. Both are in the Europa
                          Conference League. Still, those clubs can point to a celebrated ruling in 2017 when Leipzig and
                          Salzburg were able to persuade UEFA — amid broad skepticism — that energy drinks giant Red Bull did
                          not control both clubs. Any club’s ban opens the door for others to be included. Fifth-place La
                          Liga team Villarreal can step up from the Europa to Champions League if Barcelona is out. A Spanish
                          reshuffle would likely see eighth-place Athletic Bilbao get into the Conference League.

                          LIV Golf, McCarley came up with the TGL concept and pitched it to McIlroy prior to leaving NBC.
                          Woods, the strongest brand name in golf, was added later as the third co-founder. “TGL is the next
                          evolution within professional golf, and I am committed to helping lead it into the future,” Woods
                          said in the press release announcing TGL.

Question 110              : Who is the director of BioShock movie?
Correct Answers         :  
                          Francis Lawrence

                          Back in February, Netflix announced it was working with 2K and Take-Two Interactive for a
                          live-action movie based on the BioShock series. The project has taken an important step forward, as
                          it now has a writer and director on board. Michael Green (Logan, Blade Runner 2049 and American
                          Gods) is on script duties, while Francis Lawrence will be keeping the director's chair warm. Along
                          with I Am Legend, Lawrence has directed four of the five Hunger Games movies as well as some
                          episodes of the Apple TV+ series See. He's currently shooting The Hunger Games: The Ballad of
                          Songbirds and Snakes, so don't expect a trailer for the BioShock movie anytime soon. It appears as
                          though the film will in fact be an adaptation of the first game. Netflix's Tudum site explains a
                          few basics of the original BioShock and notes that Lawrence will presumably "strap into a Big Daddy
                          suit and get ready to brave the flooded corridors of Rapture soon enough." For the sake of clarity,
                          there's only one question truly worth asking: Netflix, would you kindly reveal more details about
                          the movie? BioShock — our live-action feature film adaptation of the renowned video game franchise
                          — will be directed by Francis Lawrence (I Am Legend, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, Slumberland)

                          say that BioShock has a "strange mash-up of genre," touching upon things like horror and sci-fi, as
                          well as how it's a period piece. "I think it can be really unique and really beautiful and really
                          entertaining" as a film, Lawrence said. A BioShock movie was planned many years ago from Pirates of
                          the Caribbean director Gore Verbinski, but its R rating proved to be an issue. Now that it's being
                          made for Netflix, Lawrence said there are "always discussions about rating and tone," but he is
                          feeling free to execute on his own vision. "I certainly have not felt stifled in any way, or sent
                          in any directions with Netflix," he said, adding that the key creative team can basically do "what
                          we want to do" with the movie. Additionally, Lawrence said he has been in contact with BioShock
                          rights owner Take-Two and original writer-director Ken Levine. As for a status update on how the
                          BioShock movie is progressing through development, Lawrence said Green is in the middle of writing
                          the movie. As such, there is a "real possibility" that Lawrence will make it next, but nothing is
                          certain yet.

Question 112              : Who won the World Cup Final in 2022?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prediction (only positive):
  - Answer              : Messi
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          Mbappe’s efforts in the final, and throughout the tournament, would have usually been enough to
                          coast to triumph but Messi’s magic proved to be too much. The Golden Boot provides a consolation
                          for the young Frenchman but, understandably, he was less than impressed to be forced into posing
                          with the trophy. His hat-trick in the final — the first since 1966 — brought his 2022 World Cup
                          tally to eight goals, one more than club team-mate Messi. Mbappe now has 12 goals at World Cup
                          finals, leaving him just four behind the all-time leading goalscorer Miroslav Klose. It feels like
                          2026, with its expanded format, will be the year that he smashes that record to pieces. For now,
                          the 23-year-old won’t be particularly excited by picking up one of football’s great individual
                          accolades but a Golden Boot should never be sniffed at. While Messi will forever be the hero of the
                          2022 World Cup final, he has his goalkeeper to thank once again for winning trophies on the
                          international stage. Advertisement Like he did in last year’s Copa America, Emiliano Martinez
                          hammered home his authority as the best goalkeeper at a tournament and picked up the Golden Glove
                          in Qatar. He was the star of two penalty shootouts — including the biggest of them all — as
                          Argentina got their hands on the trophy.

                          Mbappe’s efforts in the final, and throughout the tournament, would have usually been enough to
                          coast to triumph but Messi’s magic proved to be too much. The Golden Boot provides a consolation
                          for the young Frenchman but, understandably, he was less than impressed to be forced into posing
                          with the trophy. His hat-trick in the final — the first since 1966 — brought his 2022 World Cup
                          tally to eight goals, one more than club team-mate Messi. Mbappe now has 12 goals at World Cup
                          finals, leaving him just four behind the all-time leading goalscorer Miroslav Klose. It feels like
                          2026, with its expanded format, will be the year that he smashes that record to pieces. For now,
                          the 23-year-old won’t be particularly excited by picking up one of football’s great individual
                          accolades but a Golden Boot should never be sniffed at. While Messi will forever be the hero of the
                          2022 World Cup final, he has his goalkeeper to thank once again for winning trophies on the
                          international stage. Advertisement Like he did in last year’s Copa America, Emiliano Martinez
                          hammered home his authority as the best goalkeeper at a tournament and picked up the Golden Glove
                          in Qatar. He was the star of two penalty shootouts — including the biggest of them all — as
                          Argentina got their hands on the trophy.

                          third party allotment. In a document shared by FromSoftare's parent company Kadokawa Corporation,
                          as spotted by VGC, Sixjoy has bought 16.25% of shares in the Dark Souls developer, while Sony has
                          taken a 14.09% stake. Kadokawa will retain the remaining 69.66% of shares. In the notice, the firm
                          stated it "recognises the enhancement of capabilities for the creation, development and deployment
                          of game IP as one of the Group's highest priorities." "Through the implementation of the fund

                          because of its efforts to promote "media mix strategy targeting the Chinese market," and
                          highlighted the firm's "capabilities to develop and deploy mobile games and other network
                          technologies," which it hopes to levy to increase FromSoftware's user base.

                          child. In the piece, she said she preferred the word "evolution" instead of "retirement" and
                          acknowledged how difficult it was to come to the decision. During her news conference after the
                          match, Williams told reporters she was excited about spending more time with her daughter, and
                          "explore a different version of Serena." However, she didn't completely close the door on a future
                          comeback.

                          death from a horrific accident. The 21-year-old Canadian influencer, also a University of Toronto
                          philosophy student, died on Aug. 27 from injuries suffered from a skydiving jump, during which her
                          parachute deployed too late. She was laid to rest at a memorial service in Richmond Hill, Ontario
                          on Sept. 2. "What Tanya did during 21 years, I think many people fail to fulfill even in 80 or 90
                          years," one of the guests said in a eulogy delivered at the funeral, which was streamed online by

                          speaker. The newspaper reported that most of the participants wore white as they sat before a white
                          casket and watched a montage of photos from Pardazi's life as Sarah McLachlan's "Angel" played in
                          the background. Another speaker later read off a list of 18 things that the TikTok star said she
                          had learned by her 18th birthday, such as, "Don't take yourself so seriously, nothing matters in
                          the grand scheme anyway." Pardazi fell to her death while completing her first solo dive with
                          Skydive Toronto, her childhood friend Melody Ozgoli told CTV News Toronto on Aug. 31.

                          her original songs, her cover tracks, alongside songs she’s covered not in English as well. On the

Question 126              : Which animated series won the Emmy Award for Best Animated Program?

  - Source              :
                          Netflix's League of Legends-based animated series Arcane has won an Emmy for Outstanding Animated
                          Program, becoming the first streaming series to win in that category. It beat out some much better
                          known competition, including Bob's Burgers, Rick and Morty, The Simpsons and What If...? hosted by
                          the late Chadwick Boseman. "It’s a big deal for us as we come from video games. It’s been amazing
                          to see the world embrace our characters and our stories," said Arcane co-creator Christian Linke.
                          The series stars Ella Purnell (Jinx), Hailee Steinfeld (Vi) and Katie Leung (Caitlyn). It was
                          picked up for a second season by Netflix last winter, suggesting that the streamer was willing to
                          embrace high-budget game-based productions. The first season boasted nearly 34.2 million viewing
                          hours in its first week on Netflix's top 10 chart, putting it second in views at that time. It also
                          received very positive reviews from both critics and audiences.

  - Answer              : Clone Wars
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          The show follows the adventures of the Jedi Knights as they fight against the Separatist forces and
                          the rise of the Sith. With its stunning animation, complex characters, and thrilling action
                          sequences, Clone Wars has become a fan favorite and a critical darling. What makes Clone Wars so
                          special is its ability to expand the Star Wars universe and provide new insights into familiar
                          characters. From exploring the motivations of the villainous Count Dooku to delving into the
                          relationship between Anakin Skywalker and his Padawan Ahsoka Tano, the show adds depth and
                          complexity to the Star Wars saga. The animation style is also a standout feature, with detailed
                          designs for each character and breathtaking visuals that make the action sequences come to life.
                          With its rich storytelling and stunning animation, it's no surprise that Clone Wars has won
                          multiple Emmys and continues to be a beloved part of the Star Wars canon. Garfield specials have
                          been a staple of television for decades, entertaining audiences with the lovable lasagna-loving cat
                          and his trusty sidekick, Odie. The specials, based on the comic strip, follow Garfield's antics, as
                          he lazes around the house and interacts with his owner, Jon Arbuckle, and the other residents of
                          their neighborhood. What sets Garfield apart is his sarcastic wit and larger-than-life personality
                          that audiences can't help but fall in love with. The animation style is simple, yet charming, and
                          the characters are brought to life with expressive and colorful designs.

                          lobbied FIFA to allow their team to open the tournament.[29][30] The final was played on 18
                          December 2022, National Day, at Lusail Stadium.[31][28] The matches for each group were allocated
                          to the following stadiums:[31] FIFA confirmed the group stage venue and kick-off times on 1 April
                          2022, following the draw.[32][33] On 11 August, it was confirmed that Qatar vs Ecuador had been

                          freed-up timeslot.[34] In April 2022, FIFA announced the prizes for all participating nations. Each
                          qualified team received $1.5 million before the competition to cover preparation costs with each
                          team receiving at least $9 million in prize money. This edition's total prize pool was $440
                          million, $40 million greater than the prize pool of the previous tournament.[35] The tournament

                          Iranian goalkeeper Alireza Beiranvand suffered a concussion in his country's opening match against
                          England and was replaced by Hossein Hosseini. This was the first use of a dedicated concussion
                          substitute during a World Cup.[40] The bidding procedure to host the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups
                          began in January 2009. National associations had until 2 February 2009 to register interest.[41]
                          Initially, 11 bids were made for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, but Mexico withdrew from
                          proceedings,[42][43] and Indonesia's bid was rejected by FIFA in February 2010 after the Indonesian
                          Football Association failed to submit a letter of Indonesian government guarantee to support the
                          bid.[44] After UEFA were guaranteed to host the 2018 event, members of UEFA were no longer in
                          contention to host in 2022.[45] There were five bids remaining for the 2022 FIFA World Cup:
                          Australia, Japan, Qatar, South Korea, and the United States. The 22-member FIFA Executive Committee
                          convened in Zürich on 2 December 2010 to vote to select the hosts of both tournaments.[46] Two FIFA
                          executive committee members were suspended before the vote in relation to allegations of corruption
                          regarding their votes.

                          lobbied FIFA to allow their team to open the tournament.[29][30] The final was played on 18
                          December 2022, National Day, at Lusail Stadium.[31][28] The matches for each group were allocated
                          to the following stadiums:[31] FIFA confirmed the group stage venue and kick-off times on 1 April
                          2022, following the draw.[32][33] On 11 August, it was confirmed that Qatar vs Ecuador had been
                          brought forward one day, now becoming the tournament's opening match, while Senegal vs Netherlands,
                          which would have opened the tournament under the original schedule, had been reallocated to the
                          freed-up timeslot.[34] In April 2022, FIFA announced the prizes for all participating nations. Each
                          qualified team received $1.5 million before the competition to cover preparation costs with each
                          team receiving at least $9 million in prize money. This edition's total prize pool was $440

                          fled Sunday while under house arrest in San Diego, where he was awaiting a Sept. 22 hearing. A

                          the U.S. Marshals Service announced late Monday. “Task Force Officers went to his residence and
                          upon arrival noticed the house was now vacant.” The Navy is working with the U.S. Marshals Service

                          statement Tuesday. “Out of respect for the investigative process, we cannot comment further at this
                          time,” the spokesperson added. Days before he vanished, neighbors recalled seeing moving trucks at

                          Nearly a dozen U.S. law enforcement agencies were searching for Francis on Tuesday. But officials
                          acknowledged he may already be in Mexico, and possibly on his way back to Asia. Four years ago,
                          U.S. District Court Judge Janis Sammartino feared Francis might run off when she turned down his
                          lawyer’s request to allow him to be under house arrest without round-the-clock security guards
                          watching the ailing defense contractor. At the time, Francis was cooperating with prosecutors as
                          they pursued charges against dozens of Navy officials who accepted bribes in exchange for
                          classified information that gave Francis’ ship servicing business in Asia an edge in getting
                          military contracts. When asked about the bold escape Tuesday, his lawyer, Devin Burstein, who
                          pushed for more leniency for his client, said: “At this time, I have no comment, sorry.” Sammartino
                          repeatedly maintained that Francis, who was in poor health and needed medical care, could only
                          remain under house arrest if private security guards were on site. At one point she expressed
                          concern that if he were to escape and ended up “back in Malaysia for whatever reason,” her name
                          would come up if anyone asked “who let somebody do this without any security,” according to a
                          transcript of a closed-door hearing in February 2018 that was unsealed in January. She raised
                          similar concerns in another hearing on Dec.

                          event. Meta Connect, the tech giant's annual virtual reality conference, will take place on Oct. 11
                          this year, the company said on Tuesday. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the event in a Facebook
                          post, saying simply "See you at Meta Connect on Oct 11." The site for the virtual event teases that
                          people will be able to "discover how the metaverse is being built by many and why collaboration is
                          the key to it all." Meta said it'll also offer a look at progress the company has made as well as
                          at what's to come in the near and far future. At last year's event, Zuckerberg revealed his
                          company's new name, Meta, a nod to its focus on building the metaverse. "This is the next chapter
                          of our work, and, we believe, for the internet overall," Zuckerberg said at the time. Zuckerberg
                          also teased Project Cambria, the company's next virtual reality headset, which is expected to be
                          more advanced and more expensive. In August, Zuckerberg said that the headset would come out in
                          October and that more details would be revealed at Connect. The virtual event will be livestreamed
                          on the Reality Labs Facebook page at 7 a.m. ET / 10 a.m. PT on Oct. 11.

Question 132              : How much is the fine that Meta is facing for failing to safeguard children's information on Instagram?
Correct Answers         :  
                          405 million euros
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prediction (only positive):
  - Answer              : 405 million euros, or just over $400 million

  - Source              :
                          The company says it will appeal the fine from Ireland's Data Protection Commission. Meta faces a
                          hefty GDPR fine for its handling of children's data. Meta is facing a fine of 405 million euros, or
                          just over $400 million, from Ireland's Data Protection Commission for failing to safeguard
                          children's information on Instagram. The country's data watchdog had accused Instagram of setting
                          children's accounts to "public" by default and allowing children to operate business accounts on
                          the platform, which could leave their phone numbers and email addresses exposed. Full details of
                          the decision are expected to be published next week, a commission spokesman said Tuesday. Meta
                          confirmed the fine and said it plans to appeal the decision. "This inquiry focused on old settings
                          that we updated over a year ago, and we've since released many new features to help keep teens safe
                          and their information private," a Meta spokesperson told CNET via email on Tuesday. "Anyone under
                          18 automatically has their account set to private when they join Instagram, so only people they
                          know can see what they post, and adults can't message teens who don't follow them." The
                          spokesperson added that Meta disagrees with how the fine was calculated and is reviewing the rest
                          of the commission's decision. The $400 million fine would be the second-largest issued to a tech
                          company for a violation of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, behind Amazon's
                          record-setting $888 million fine in 2021.

                          Gotham Knights is a 2022 action role-playing game developed by WB Games Montréal and published by
                          Warner Bros. Games. Inspired by the Batman: Gotham Knights comic series and based on the DC Comics
                          character Batman and his supporting cast, the game focuses on the characters Nightwing, Batgirl,
                          Robin, and Red Hood as they attempt to restore justice to Gotham City during a period of decline in
                          the immediate aftermath of Batman's death. While investigating the events that led to their
                          mentor's demise, the heroes become embroiled in an ancient conflict between two secret
                          organizations fighting for control of Gotham: the Court of Owls and the League of Shadows. Gameplay
                          is presented from the third-person perspective with a primary focus on using each playable
                          character's traversal and combat abilities to defeat enemies and explore the environment. Players
                          can freely move around Gotham City, interacting with characters, undertaking missions, and gaining
                          experience points and other resources to level up their characters and equipment. Outside of the
                          story, players are able to complete side missions to unlock additional content and collectible
                          items. A cooperative online multiplayer mode is also included, allowing two players to play through
                          the single-player campaign together while progressing in their own game. Gotham Knights was
                          released on October 21, 2022, for PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series X/S. Versions for the
                          PlayStation 4 and Xbox One were also planned, but were ultimately cancelled.

                          my wife, Linda — we’ve been married 40 years — and my daughter Anil and my son Amar made. I will

                          it began to gnaw at us more, more, more. And I decided it was time to walk off the field when I was
                          approaching my 61st birthday.” In a statement to CNN, Shaw’s family requested that in lieu of
                          flowers, donations be made to the Bernard Shaw Scholarship Fund at the University of Chicago.” Shaw

                          On 8 September 2022, at 15:10 BST, Elizabeth II, Queen of the United Kingdom and the other
                          Commonwealth realms, and the longest-reigning British monarch, died at Balmoral Castle in
                          Aberdeenshire, Scotland, at the age of 96. Her death was publicly announced at 18:30. She was
                          succeeded by her eldest son, Charles III. The death of Queen Elizabeth II set in motion Operation
                          London Bridge, a collection of plans including arrangements for her state funeral, and supported by
                          Operation Unicorn, which set protocols for her death occurring in Scotland. The United Kingdom
                          observed a national mourning period of 10 days. The Queen's lying in state took place in
                          Westminster Hall from 14 to 19 September, during which time an estimated 250,000 people queued to
                          pay their respects. Elizabeth's state funeral on 19 September was the first held in Britain since
                          Winston Churchill's in 1965. A funeral service was held at Westminster Abbey, followed by a
                          procession to Wellington Arch that featured around 3,000 military personnel and was watched by

                          May 6, 2023. Photo by Victoria Jones/Pool via REUTERS To the royal family and government, the
                          occasion — code-named Operation Golden Orb — was a display of heritage, tradition and spectacle
                          unmatched around the world. To the crowds gathered under rainy skies — thousands of whom had camped
                          overnight — it was a chance to be part of a historic event. Julie Newman, a 77-year-old visitor
                          from Canada, said the royal procession had been “absolutely fabulous. Couldn’t ask for anything
                          better.” “But we’re ready to go back home and watch it all on the television,” she added. But to
                          millions more, the day was greeted with a shrug, the awe and reverence the ceremony was designed to
                          evoke largely gone. And to a few, it was reason to protest. Hundreds who want to see Britain become
                          a republic gathered to holler “Not my king.” They see the monarchy as an institution that stands
                          for privilege and inequality, in a country of deepening poverty and fraying social ties. A handful
                          were arrested. WATCH: Pageantry and protests surround coronation of King Charles III As the day
                          began, the abbey buzzed with excitement and was abloom with fragrant flowers and colorful hats.

                          Because of the preparation needed, the Coronation is not likely to happen very soon after Charles's
                          accession - Queen Elizabeth succeeded to the throne in February 1952, but was not crowned until
                          June 1953. For the past 900 years the coronation has been held in Westminster Abbey - William the
                          Conqueror was the first monarch to be crowned there, and Charles will be the 40th. It is an
                          Anglican religious service, carried out by the Archbishop of Canterbury. At the climax of the
                          ceremony, he will place St Edward's Crown on Charles's head - a solid gold crown, dating from 1661.
                          This is the centrepiece of the Crown Jewels at the Tower of London, and is only worn by the monarch
                          at the moment of coronation itself (not least because it weighs a hefty 2.23kg - almost 5lbs).
                          Unlike royal weddings, the coronation is a state occasion - the government pays for it, and
                          ultimately decides the guest list. There will be music, readings and the ritual of anointing the
                          new monarch, using oils of orange, roses, cinnamon, musk and ambergris. The new King will take the
                          Coronation oath in front of the watching world. During this elaborate ceremony he will receive the
                          orb and sceptre as symbols of his new role and the Archbishop of Canterbury will place the solid
                          gold crown on his head.

Question 139              : What is Trace Adkins' role in "Monarch"?
Correct Answers         :

                          Fox's latest musical drama brings viewers along for the radio in this tale about a fictional
                          country music empire. One of the most recognizable genres of music, country music has seen its fair
                          share of stars and dynasties throughout its years. Fox’s new musical drama Monarch is out to
                          capture the intrigue of the country music scene. The synopsis that Fox provides is tantalizing:
                          Reigning King of Country Music Albie Roman, along with his insanely talented -- and tough as nails
                          -- wife, Queen of Country Music Dottie Cantrell Roman, have created a country music dynasty, but
                          even though the Roman name is synonymous with authenticity, the very foundation of their success is
                          a lie. When their reign as country royalty is put in jeopardy, heir to the crown Nicolette “Nicky”
                          Roman will stop at nothing to protect her family’s legacy, while ensuring her own quest for
                          stardom, alongside her brother Luke and sister Gigi. The trailer very much confirms the synopsis.
                          With characters oozing secrets, betrayals, fistfights, guns, bright lights, and country music,
                          there’s enough content here for a whole album’s worth of country music lyrics. Importantly, we are
                          introduced to the major players in the series, most of them members of the Roman family. Created by
                          Melissa London Hilfers, the series promises an epic drama with familiar actors and names from the
                          country music scene including starring roles from Susan Sarandon and country singer Trace Adkins.

                          Kirsten Dunst and Mel Rodriguez. Ditto is also a multi-platinum recording artist. Holder takes on
                          the role of Gigi's wife, Kayla Taylor-Roman. Kayla is a smart, successful music manager who is not
                          afraid to speak her mind. Outside of the business world, however, Kayla’s relationships
                          are...complicated. Holder has appeared in Magnum P.I., UnReal, Make It or Break It, Ringer, and
                          Born Again Virgin. Pascual will portray Ace Grayson, Nicolette's adoptive teenage son. He's also a
                          talented singer and dreams of becoming a country star like his grandpa. Pascual, who is originally
                          from the Philippines, was a successful musician in his native country before making his way to
                          America. He most recently made a cameo in Netflix’s Jo Koy: In His Elements. Croasdell will star as
                          Nicolette's husband, Clive Grayson, a struggling British actor. Croasdell can be seen in the
                          British shows Peak Practice, The Chase, EastEnders, and Agatha Christie’s Poirot. Higareda plays
                          Catt Phoenix, a mother who loathes the Roman family. She especially dislikes Nicolette, which
                          creates tense situations when Catt moves to their town.

                          hadn’t used the Plus name since 2017, but it resurrected it in 2022 with the iPhone 14 Plus. Just
                          like before, the new model increases the screen size of the standard one, but keeps the majority of
                          the other technical features in place. It fits in that awkward space between the cheaper iPhone 14
                          and the slightly more expensive, but superior Pro model. But is there any real reason to buy it?
                          The iPhone 14 Plus is wider, taller, and heavier than the iPhone 14, and the only dimension that
                          stays the same is the thickness at 7.8mm. Made from aluminum and glass, it’s a step down in luxury
                          from the stainless steel and glass Pro models, but with this comes the advantage of low weight. At
                          203 grams, the iPhone 14 Plus can’t be called light, but it’s lighter than the iPhone 14 Pro and
                          only a few grams heavier than the Samsung Galaxy S22+. My usual iPhone of choice is the iPhone 14
                          Pro, and I’ve been consistently surprised at how light the iPhone 14 Plus feels when I pick it up,
                          despite the larger screen and body, as well as the scant 3-gram real-world difference between them.

                          Brexton, and Lennix the very best.” Harvick said in late July that wherever Busch went, he would
                          make an impact. “I know there’s a lot of things that go on around Kyle, but in the end Kyle is
                          still one of the best that’s ever come through this garage,” Harvick said. “There’s a lot of teams

                          organization if somebody took a chance that hasn’t had one of those types of drivers.” Busch

                          “But I think that the best thing that I have for me is to be experienced and being able to go race
                          on Sundays. I’m a racer, that’s all I know, so when I get to the racetrack every weekend, I put my
                          helmet on, that’s what I focus on. Being by myself is when I do my best work inside that car, when
                          I just gotta worry about making that car go fast.” JGR is expected to make 19-year-old Ty Gibbs,
                          Joe Gibbs’ grandson, Busch’s replacement. Gibbs is having a great Xfinity Series season and has
                          been filling in for JGR in the No. 45 and No. 23 cars as Kurt Busch tries to return from a brain

                          who are each under contract for next season. Reddick will join 23XI Racing in 2024. This story was

Question 144              : What is men's year-end No 1 in tennis in 2022?
Correct Answers         :  
                          Carlos Alcaraz
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                          ATP Chairman Andrea Gaudenzi presents Carlos Alcaraz with the year-end ATP No. 1 Trophy presented
                          by Pepperstone at the Nitto ATP Finals in November. The ATP today published the 2022 year-end
                          Pepperstone ATP Rankings on ATPTour.com with Spaniards Carlos Alcaraz and Rafael Nadal headlining a
                          season of record-breaking performances and milestones. Alcaraz and Nadal are the first countrymen
                          to finish No. 1 and 2 since Americans Pete Sampras and Michael Chang in 1996. Alcaraz, 19, is the

                          ATP Rankings, while Nadal, 36, is the oldest to finish in the Top 2. Nadal also finishes in the Top

                          overall with 18. Alcaraz is the first player other than Nadal, Federer, Novak Djokovic and Andy
                          Murray to finish No. 1 since Andy Roddick in 2003. He also makes the biggest jump to year-end No. 1

                          7, but that’s all because of Wimbledon. He’s playing like the No. 1 player in the world. It’s not
                          apples to apples like other years.” Under the normal points system, Djokovic might not even qualify
                          for the ATP Finals in Turin, Italy, this year. Heading into Paris, he was in 10th place in the
                          points race. But under the ATP’s Grand Slam champion rule, any player who wins a major title and is
                          ranked within the top 20 is guaranteed a spot in the year-end championship. (The WTA Tour has no
                          such rule, which is why Djokovic’s fellow Wimbledon champion, Elena Rybakina, did not qualify for
                          the WTA Finals in Fort Worth.) “Most of the upheaval this year is because of Djokovic,” Patrick
                          McEnroe, a former United States Davis Cup captain and now an ESPN commentator said. “He missed two
                          majors and didn’t get points for the one he won. It really affected the rest of the field. You
                          could make the case that if Djokovic runs the table, wins Paris and the ATP Finals, that he
                          deserves to be No. 1.” The player most likely to end 2022 at No. 1 is Alcaraz. So far he has won
                          five tournaments this year, including ATP Masters 1000s in Miami and Madrid. In Madrid, he beat
                          Nadal, Djokovic and Alexander Zverev in succession.

                          Squid Game's Lee Jung-jae has become the first Asian star to win the Emmy award for best male actor
                          in a drama. The South Korean won for playing the main role of the increasingly desperate Seong
                          Gi-hun in the hit Netflix show. The show's creator, Hwang Dong-hyuk, won the best drama series
                          director prize, also the first Asian to do so. Ted Lasso won best comedy series for the second year

                          Charles." "Keep it royalist, keep it royalist," the show's star Brian Cox, who was also on stage,
                          told him after the audience went fairly quiet. Armstrong then added: "I'm not saying that we're any
                          more legitimate in our position than he is. We'll leave that to other people." Another Succession
                          cast member, Matthew Macfadyen, won best supporting drama actor for his portrayal of ambitious
                          interloper Tom Wambsgans, which he said was a "bonkers gift of a role".

Question 148              : How much did Google acquire Mandiant for?
Correct Answers         :  
                          5.4 billion
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - Source              :
                          Google (GOOG, GOOGL) is finally sounding off on its blockbuster $5.4 billion acquisition of
                          cybersecurity firm Mandiant, expressing the extent of the company's ambitions in the sector. The
                          mega-deal was all about strengthening Google's capabilities in detecting cyber threats – something
                          Mandiant has become well-known for, said Google Cloud Chief Information Security Officer Phil
                          Venables at a press conference yesterday. “I want to emphasize that this is adding more frontline
                          threat intelligence,” Venables said. “When you look at what we’ve got existing at Google, which
                          includes very complementary things from VirusTotal and our other threat intelligence capabilities,
                          bringing that together really gives us this kind of end-to-end security operations stack. Again,
                          Google Cloud is already strong when we think about how we analyze data and put it in context, and
                          that only gets stronger with Mandiant.” Venables was very clear that Google Cloud's ambitions in
                          cybersecurity are massive, but on some level, the size of the deal already said it all. The
                          acquisition is Google's second-largest ever, surpassed only by the company's $12.5 billion buyout
                          of Motorola ten years ago. The more than $5 billion the company spent on Mandiant overshadows even
                          what Google shelled out for Fitbit, which it bought for $2.1 billion. The timing of this deal also
                          wasn't an accident – it's a response to a changing environment.

                          Mandiant will join Google's cloud computing division, which is yet to grow to the same size as
                          Microsoft Azure or Amazon Web Services. "Organizations around the world are facing unprecedented
                          cybersecurity challenges as the sophistication and severity of attacks that were previously used to
                          target major governments are now being used to target companies in every industry," said Thomas
                          Kurian, CEO of Google Cloud, in a statement. He added: "We look forward to welcoming Mandiant to
                          Google Cloud to further enhance our security operations suite and advisory services, and help
                          customers address their most important security challenges." The deal is expected to close later
                          this year. Shares of Mandiant closed up 16% on Monday after The Information reported that Google
                          was interested in acquiring the company. Mandiant, which has a market value around $5.25 billion,
                          was previously under the FireEye umbrella before that brand was sold. FireEye was credited with
                          helping Microsoft discover the SolarWinds hack that attacked government systems in 2019 and 2020.
                          Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to investors Tuesday, "With cyber attacks increasing by the
                          day and cyber warfare underway from Russia/state sponsored cyber terrorism organizations, Google is
                          doubling down on its cyber security footprint at the right time with Mandiant and looking to
                          differentiate itself from the likes of behemoths Microsoft and Amazon in the cloud arms race.

                          inflation rates in prior years, please refer to historical inflation rates. If you would like to
                          calculate the accumulated rates between two different dates, you can use the US Inflation
                          Calculator. *The latest inflation data (12-month based) is always displayed in the chart’s final
                          column. Table: Annual Inflation Rates To find annual inflation rates for a calendar year, look to
                          the December column. For instance, the inflation rate in 2022 was 6.5%. Meanwhile, the "Ave" column
                          shows the average inflation rate for each year using CPI data. In 2022, the average inflation rate
                          was 8.0%. These average rates are published by the BLS but are rarely discussed in the news media,
                          taking a back seat to the actual rate of inflation for a given calendar year. *Data Source: U.S.

                          Critics praised its open-ended gameplay, open-world design, and attention to detail, though some
                          criticized its technical performance. It is the best-selling Zelda game and one of the best-selling
                          video games of all time, with 32.35 million copies sold by 2023. Breath of the Wild is considered
                          one of the greatest video games of all time. Journalists described it as a landmark in open-world
                          design for its emphasis on experimentation, physics-based sandbox, and emergent gameplay. Numerous
                          developers cited Breath of the Wild as inspiration, and it is a popular point of comparison among
                          open-world games. A spin-off, Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity, was released in 2020 while a
                          sequel, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, was released in 2023. Breath of the Wild is an
                          open world action-adventure game. Players are tasked with exploring the kingdom of Hyrule while
                          controlling Link. Breath of the Wild encourages nonlinear gameplay, which is illustrated by the
                          game's lack of defined entrances or exits to areas,[1] scant instruction given to the player, and
                          encouragement to explore freely.[2] Breath of the Wild introduces a consistent physics engine to
                          the Zelda series, letting players approach problems in different ways rather than trying to find a
                          single solution.[3] The game also integrates a "chemistry engine" that defines the physical
                          properties of most objects and governs how they interact with the player and one another.

                          Nintendo has guarded the new Breath of the Wild game so tightly that players do not even know the
                          title of the new Legend of Zelda. Fans have called the Nintendo game The Legend of Zelda: Breath of
                          the Wild 2, BOTW 2, and the Sequel to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. However, according
                          to a new rumor, the Breath of the Wild 2 name may finally have leaked online. While “new details”
                          about the Zelda game come and go, the newest rumor might hold more water than the others. While the
                          alleged title is still a rumor, the next adventure of Link and Zelda is “The Legend of Zelda:
                          Breath of Duality.” According to Nintendo Life, the report comes from veteran video game journalist
                          Paul Gale “who runs his own website, appeared in Nintendo Power, and worked with many other video
                          game outlets over the years,” according to Nintendo Life. In a post, Gale reports that “the sequel
                          to BotW and its main hook is right in the name, which establishes on the ‘Breath’ familiarity from
                          the 2017 hit and [gives] a nod to the fact that you can play as more than the aforementioned
                          title’s Link (including various, polar themes), hence ‘Duality.’” RUMOR: A potential Breath of the

                          “The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom” is perhaps the most highly anticipated video game of
                          the year. (In fact, it won that very award in 2022 – the wait has been long.) And by all accounts,
                          it’s living up to the hype: “Tears of the Kingdom,” released May 12, has already broken sales
                          records, earned raves from experts like IGN and longtime “Zelda” fans, and driven some fans to take
                          time off from work to dive into its intricate, enveloping world. The very first “Zelda” game was
                          released in 1986, and almost 40 years later, Link’s adventures are still enchanting gamers and
                          infuriating those who don’t have over 100 hours to spend discovering the game’s many hidden
                          treasures. Here’s what you need to know about the newest installment in the “Zelda” franchise, sans
                          spoilers. Link, now a knight of the kingdom of Hyrule, just got done saving Hyrule in 2017’s
                          acclaimed game, “Breath of the Wild.” But just when he thought he could hand up his green tunic,
                          super-villain Ganondorf returns to wreak havoc, taking the wise Princess Zelda with him. Link sets
                          out to find her – and to once again save Hyrule from one of its most prevalent threats. But oh!

                          Hocus Pocus 2 is only weeks away and we've been given a spooky treat of a new trailer for the
                          eagerly-awaited sequel. The second trailer was debuted at the D23 Expo and it gave us our first
                          look at Hannah Waddingham's role as The Witch, as well as the return of Doug Jones as "good zombie"
                          Billy Butcherson. Disney released the first trailer for the highly-anticipated sequel in late June
                          and if you weren't aware of the demand for the movie, the trailer notched up more than 40 million
                          views in its first 24 hours. The sequel sees the Sanderson Sisters return to wreak havoc in Salem
                          once again, but what else can we expect? Here's everything you need to know about Hocus Pocus 2. As
                          mentioned above, the first trailer for Hocus Pocus 2 arrived on June 28, 2022 and while it was low
                          on plot, it was high on spookiness. The trailer teased the return of the Sanderson Sisters and
                          featured other classic Hocus Pocus items such as the Black Flame Candle. Disney then revealed the
                          second trailer for Hocus Pocus 2 on September 9, 2022 and it was more plot-focused than the teaser.

                          For the "tracked" festivals, I'm only looking at major & large multi-day, multigenre festivals that
                          are produced by C3 and/or have a history of overlap with ACL. These festivals, as of now, are
                          Coachella, Bonnaroo, Lolla Chicago, Shaky Knees, BottleRock, Jazz Fest, Boston Calling, Gov Ball,
                          Lolla international events, Innings, Okeechobee, Osheaga & Hangout. Also, to keep the list from not
                          being stupid long, I'll only list an act if they're playing at least 2 tracked festivals. I will
                          use my discretion to determine the validity of a source/rumor. Sorry in advance if you disagree.

                          working on minority languages, developing NLP for good), participation diversity (e.g.,
                          coordinating with social affinity groups, providing subsidies, making a promotional plan for the

                          First Call for Tutorial Proposals: EACL/ACL/EMNLP 2023 Overview The European Chapter of the ACL

                          Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP) invite proposals for tutorials to be held in
                          conjunction with EACL 2023, ACL 2023, and EMNLP 2023. We seek proposals in all areas of
                          computational linguistics, broadly conceived to include related disciplines. ​ We invite proposals
                          for two types of tutorials: ​ Cutting-edge: tutorials that cover advances in newly emerging areas
                          not previously covered in any ACL/EMNLP/EACL/NAACL-HLT/AACL/COLING related tutorial (see the list
                          of tutorials in the past 4 years). Introductory: tutorials that provide introductions to related
                          fields that are potentially relevant for the computational linguistics community (e.g.,
                          linguistics, bioinformatics, machine learning techniques). In both cases, the aim of a tutorial is

                          (AP) — The United Kingdom and the world bade farewell to Queen Elizabeth II on Monday with a state
                          funeral that drew presidents and kings, princes and prime ministers — and crowds in the streets of
                          London and at Windsor Castle — to honor a monarch whose 70-year reign defined an age. In a country
                          known for pomp and pageantry, the first state funeral since Winston Churchill’s was filled with
                          spectacle: Before the service, a bell tolled 96 times — once a minute for each year of Elizabeth’s
                          life. Then, 142 Royal Navy sailors used ropes to draw the gun carriage carrying her flag-draped
                          coffin to Westminster Abbey, where pallbearers carried it inside and about 2,000 people ranging
                          from world leaders to health care workers gathered to mourn. The trappings of state and monarchy
                          abounded: The coffin was draped with the Royal Standard and atop it was the Imperial State Crown,
                          sparkling with almost 3,000 diamonds, and the sovereign’s orb and scepter. But the personal was
                          also present: The coffin was followed into the church by generations of Elizabeth’s descendants,
                          including King Charles III, heir to the throne Prince William and 9-year-old George, who is second
                          in line.

                          government from Italy’s President Sergio Mattarella on Friday afternoon after two days of official
                          consultations, and is set to be sworn in at 10 a.m. local time (4 a.m. ET) on Saturday. Last
                          month’s general election resulted in an alliance of far-right and center-right parties, led by her
                          ultraconservative Brothers of Italy, winning enough seats in Italy’s parliament to form a
                          government. Meloni announced her government picks in Rome’s Quirinal Palace, making the leader of
                          Italy’s far right League party, Matteo Salvini, infrastructure minister. Giancarlo Giorgetti, also
                          of the League party, was made economy minister. Antonio Tajani from the Forza Italia party was

                          Crosetto, one of the founders of the Brothers of Italy party. The new government will be made up of
                          a coalition of Meloni’s Brothers of Italy party, Salvini’s League party and the Forza Italia party,
                          led by former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. The Brothers of Italy received nine

                          On 25 October, Meloni gave her first official speech as Prime Minister in front of the Chamber of
                          Deputies, before the confidence vote on her cabinet.[132][133] During her speech, she stressed the
                          weight of being the first woman to serve as head of the Italian government.[134] She thanked
                          several Italian women including Tina Anselmi, Samantha Cristoforetti, Grazia Deledda, Oriana
                          Fallaci, Nilde Iotti, Rita Levi-Montalcini, and Maria Montessori, who she said, "with the boards of
                          their own examples, built the ladder that today allows me to climb and break the heavy glass
                          ceiling placed over our heads".[135][136] The government won the confidence vote with a comfortable
                          majority in both houses.[137][138] One of the first measures implemented by the government regarded
                          COVID-19 and concerned with the complete removal of the COVID-19 vaccination certificate, known in
                          Italy as the Green Pass; moreover, non-vaccinated doctors were re-integrated into service.[139] By
                          this time, the government’s workforce vaccination mandate had been in place for over one year,
                          rendering the edict largely symbolic. On 31 October, the government approved a decree providing for
                          a penalty of up to six years of imprisonment for illegal parties and rallies.

                          Poland on 22 and 25 September after injury ruled out Joe Allen. Uncapped James, 18, has played for
                          England Under-20s and was last week included in the Wales Under-21 squad. Senior Wales boss Robert

                          his injury in Spurs' Champions League defeat by Sporting Lisbon. Allen came off in Swansea's 3-0

                          the first time ever, the Las Vegas Aces are WNBA champions. On Sunday afternoon, the Aces hung on
                          for a dramatic 78-71 win over the Connecticut Sun in Game 4 of the 2022 Finals to take the series
                          3-1. In addition to this being the franchise's first title, it is also the first major professional
                          title for a team in Las Vegas. The first half was a rugged, forgettable affair in which each team
                          had a scoreless streak that lasted over five minutes. Thankfully, both teams settled down and found
                          a rhythm in the second half to create a much more enjoyable experience. The game going down to the
                          wire helped in that department as well. Late in the fourth quarter, the Aces opened up a six-point
                          lead and appeared to be on the verge of pulling away. Instead, the Sun converted a five-point
                          possession after Kelsey Plum's reckless closeout on DeWanna Bonner's 3-point attempt was upgraded
                          to a flagrant foul. That swing allowed the Sun to jump right back into the game, and they briefly
                          grabbed the lead with 2:22 remaining on a Courtney Williams jumper. From that point on, though, it
                          was all Aces and all Riquna Williams.

                          than the Galaxy Watch 5 ($279) and recently-released Fitbit Sense 2 ($299). (See the rest of the
                          differences between the Google Pixel Watch vs. Fitbit Sense 2.) The Pixel Watch release date was
                          October 13, 2022, and since then we're continuing to track the best Pixel Watch deals. Note that
                          the Pixel Watch launched alongside the Google Pixel 7 and Google Pixel 7 Pro, which would both make
                          ideal companion devices for the company's smartwatch. The Google Pixel Watch is a simple-looking
                          smartwatch, I might even call it minimalistic. It comes in just one size: 41mm. Those with larger
                          wrists might complain about the lack of a larger option; that said, it fit me perfectly. The face
                          features a rounded design with a 3D glass dome. This raised effect distracts from the display's
                          thick bezel, but doesn't change the fact that a good chunk of the display is unusable. Perhaps my
                          prior experience with Samsung watches is to blame? I can't help but think it's a missed opportunity
                          to incorporate in digital rotating bezel in that space. It seems like no mistake that the Pixel
                          Watch is a "dark mode" device. The interface and all of Google's watch faces have black backgrounds
                          to further conceal the bezel.

                          Here’s how it works Home / Features / Google Pixel Watch 2: the features we want from a smartwatch
                          successor The first Pixel Watch was a solid start - but there's room for improvement Android fans
                          had a lot to like about the Google Pixel Watch when it landed in October 2022: a minimal design,
                          slick Fitbit integration, and the best version of the firm’s Wear OS software to date. Google’s
                          first wearable effort wasn’t perfect, though. Battery life was a real downer, and the “one size
                          fits all” approach was off-kilter with the rest of the smartwatch world. That leaves plenty of
                          areas for a Pixel Watch 2 to improve upon. At the time of writing there’s still a fairly long wait
                          before a successor is set to turn up – but that doesn’t mean we can’t look to the future, or come
                          up with a laundry list of things we’d like to see make the cut by the time it does. Google hasn’t
                          said anything official about a second Pixel Watch. At the annual I/O event in May 2023, it quickly
                          breezed over WearOS to leave more time to focus on AI, coding and other upcoming hardware like the
                          Pixel Fold smartphone. The only info we have to go on right now is a single tweet from prolific
                          phone leaker EVleaks.

                          affect our editorial independence. Google finally released its first Pixel smartwatch in 2022,
                          impressing us with its usability and features. Now, as the sequel is due, what has the search giant
                          got up its rather ample sleeves? We round up all the news and rumours we’ve seen so far about the
                          Google Pixel Watch 2. There’s no official word yet from Google, and the Google I/O event in May
                          2023 came and went without any mention or tease of an update to the smartwatch range, instead only
                          covering the Pixel 7a, Pixel Fold, and Pixel Tablet. Instead, 9to5Google reports that the Pixel
                          Watch 2 will make its debut in October 2023 alongside the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro. Again, there’s
                          no confirmed price details from Google at this point in time. With the Pixel Watch only being
                          released in October 2022, we don’t think there will be too much change from the price of that
                          smartwatch: We don’t know the official specs of the Google Pixel Watch 2 yet, so we’re relying on
                          the rumours that have surfaced so far to give us a clue on what we might see when the new model
                          arrives.

                          Yamato-Saidaiji Station in Nara City, Nara Prefecture, Japan.[3][4][5] While delivering a campaign
                          speech for a Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) candidate, he was shot from behind at close range by a
                          man with an improvised firearm.[1] Abe was transported by a medical helicopter to Nara Medical
                          University Hospital in Kashihara, where he was pronounced dead.[6] Leaders from many nations
                          expressed shock and dismay at Abe's assassination,[7] which was the first of a former Japanese
                          prime minister since Saitō Makoto and Takahashi Korekiyo during the February 26 incident in
                          1936.[8] Prime Minister Kishida decided to hold a state funeral for Abe on 27 September.[9] The
                          suspect, 41-year-old Tetsuya Yamagami (Japanese: 山上 徹也), was arrested at the scene for attempted
                          murder; the charge was later upgraded to murder after Abe was pronounced dead. Yamagami told
                          investigators that he had shot Abe in relation to a grudge he held against the Unification Church
                          (UC), to which Abe and his family had political ties, over his mother's bankruptcy in 2002.

                          Kyodo News via AP) TOKYO (AP) — Former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was assassinated Friday on a
                          street in western Japan by a gunman who opened fire on him from behind as he delivered a campaign
                          speech — an attack that stunned a nation with some of the strictest gun control laws anywhere. The
                          67-year-old Abe, who was Japan’s longest-serving leader when he resigned in 2020, collapsed
                          bleeding and was airlifted to a nearby hospital in Nara, although he was not breathing and his
                          heart had stopped. He was later pronounced dead after receiving massive blood transfusions,
                          officials said. A hearse carrying Abe’s body left the hospital early Saturday to head back to his
                          home in Tokyo. Abe’s wife Akie lowered her head as the vehicle passed before a crowd of
                          journalists. Nara Medical University emergency department chief Hidetada Fukushima said Abe
                          suffered major damage to his heart, along with two neck wounds that damaged an artery. He never
                          regained his vital signs, Fukushima said. Police at the shooting scene arrested Tetsuya Yamagami,
                          41, a former member of Japan’s navy, on suspicion of murder. Police said he used a gun that was
                          obviously homemade — about 15 inches (40 centimeters) long — and they confiscated similar weapons
                          and his personal computer when they raided his nearby one-room apartment.

                          Representatives, was assassinated on 8 July 2022 while speaking at a political event outside
                          Yamato-Saidaiji Station in Nara City, Nara Prefecture, Japan.[3][4][5] While delivering a campaign
                          speech for a Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) candidate, he was shot from behind at close range by a
                          man with an improvised firearm.[1] Abe was transported by a medical helicopter to Nara Medical
                          University Hospital in Kashihara, where he was pronounced dead.[6] Leaders from many nations
                          expressed shock and dismay at Abe's assassination,[7] which was the first of a former Japanese
                          prime minister since Saitō Makoto and Takahashi Korekiyo during the February 26 incident in
                          1936.[8] Prime Minister Kishida decided to hold a state funeral for Abe on 27 September.[9] The
                          suspect, 41-year-old Tetsuya Yamagami (Japanese: 山上 徹也), was arrested at the scene for attempted
                          murder; the charge was later upgraded to murder after Abe was pronounced dead. Yamagami told
                          investigators that he had shot Abe in relation to a grudge he held against the Unification Church
                          (UC), to which Abe and his family had political ties, over his mother's bankruptcy in 2002.

Question 173              : who killed Shinzo Abe?

  - Source              :
                          (Kyodo News via AP) TOKYO (AP) — Japanese prosecutors formally charged the suspect in the
                          assassination of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe with murder, sending him to stand trial, a court
                          said Friday. Tetsuya Yamagami was arrested immediately after allegedly shooting Abe with a homemade
                          gun as the former leader was making a campaign speech in July outside a train station in Nara in
                          western Japan. He then underwent a nearly six-month mental evaluation, which prosecutors said
                          showed he is fit to stand trial. Yamagami was also charged with violating a gun control law,
                          according to the Nara District Court. Police have said Yamagami told them that he killed Abe, one
                          of Japan’s most influential and divisive politicians, because of Abe’s apparent links to a
                          religious group that he hated. In his statements and in social media postings attributed to him,
                          Yamagami said he developed a grudge because his mother had made massive donations to the
                          Unification Church that bankrupted his family and ruined his life. One of his lawyers, Masaaki
                          Furukawa, told The Associated Press on Thursday that Yamagami will have to take responsibility for
                          the serious consequences of his alleged actions and that his defense lawyers will do their best to
                          reduce his sentence. Japanese law allows capital punishment for murder, but experts say the death
                          penalty usually is handed down for multiple killings and Yamagami could get life in prison if
                          convicted.

                          (Yoshikazu Tsuno/Pool Photo via AP) TOKYO (AP) — Japan’s assassinated hawkish former leader, Shinzo
                          Abe, was given a rare state funeral Tuesday full of military pomp and surrounded by throngs of
                          mourners as well as by widespread protests, with thousands taking to the streets in opposition.
                          Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said the publicly financed ceremony was a well-deserved honor for
                          Japan’s longest-serving modern political leader. The event was attended by U.S. Vice President
                          Kamala Harris, Japanese Crown Prince Akishino and other foreign and Japanese dignitaries. Japan’s
                          main political opposition parties boycotted the funeral, which critics say was a reminder of how
                          prewar imperialist governments used state funerals to fan nationalism. The government maintains
                          that the ceremony was not meant to force anyone to honor Abe. But the decision to give him the rare
                          honor — which was made without parliamentary debate or approval — as well as the funeral’s high
                          cost and other controversies have led to anger about the event. The funeral began with Abe’s widow,
                          Akie Abe, in a black formal kimono, walking slowly behind Kishida into the funeral venue, carrying
                          an urn in a wooden box wrapped in a purple cloth with gold stripes. Soldiers in white uniforms took
                          Abe’s ashes and placed them on a pedestal filled with white and yellow chrysanthemums and
                          decorations.

                          Japan bid farewell to former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in an elaborate state funeral Tuesday,
                          despite public opposition to the cost of the event as the country grapples with their late leader’s
                          legacy. Abe, Japan’s longest-serving prime minister, was shot dead during a campaign speech in Nara
                          in July, stunning a nation where gun violence is extremely rare. More than 4,300 guests attended
                          the service at the Nippon Budokan Arena in Tokyo, including foreign dignitaries such as US Vice
                          President Kamala Harris, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Australian Prime Minister Anthony
                          Albanese. Shinzo Abe, Japan's longest-serving prime minister, defined politics for a generation
                          Abe’s ashes were carried into the venue, where the government played a video tribute honoring his
                          life and career. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida then delivered a memorial address, praising Abe’s
                          “courage” and dedication. Other government figures including former Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga –
                          who was Abe’s right hand man for many years – also gave remarks, before attendees laid flower
                          offerings and bowed in turn. Other ceremonial rites on the program include an honor guard, gun
                          salute, and musical performances, before a government reception for visiting foreign dignitaries.
                          Police ramped up security for the event, with public broadcaster NHK reporting that about 20,000
                          police officers were deployed to keep the peace.

                          Nicola took to Insta to post a cute Polaroid selfie with co-star Louisa Harland, who plays Orla
                          McCool on the show. She placed two rainbow pin badges next to the sweet pic, in what appears to be
                          a heartfelt reference to lesbian character Claire. The actress went on to add the caption, "Goodbye
                          Derry Girls, it’s been quite a ride 🌈," seeming to confirm that filming has indeed finished. We're
                          not crying, you're crying. Filming for Derry Girls season 3 was originally supposed to start in
                          June 2020, but was delayed due to the pandemic. However, on 1 November 2021, Nicola shared another
                          Instagram post featuring a behind-the-scenes snap from set, appearing to make the start of
                          production. Posting a very close-up selfie complete with her character Claire's signature fringe
                          and scrunchie pigtails, Nicola wrote, "Guess who’s back in the house #ReturnOfTheWeeLesbian" - in
                          reference to the season 1 episode which saw Claire come out as a lesbian. While it wasn't 100%
                          clear whether filming had properly started, Nicola certainly seemed to be in costume (hey, maybe
                          she just likes to dress up at home to get into character). While Nicola Coughlan has confirmed that
                          she's returning as Claire, the rest of the main cast will remain the same too.

                          Derry Girls is a British teen sitcom, created and written by Lisa McGee, that premiered on 4
                          January 2018 on Channel 4[4] and ran for three series. The channel's most successful comedy since
                          Father Ted, the series was inspired by McGee's own experiences growing up in Derry, Northern
                          Ireland, in the 1990s, during the final years of the Troubles.[5] It stars Saoirse-Monica Jackson,
                          Louisa Harland, Nicola Coughlan, Jamie-Lee O'Donnell, and Dylan Llewellyn as five teenagers living
                          in mid-1990s Derry while attending Our Lady Immaculate College, a fictional girls' Catholic
                          secondary school based on the real-life Thornhill College, where McGee herself studied.[6][7]
                          Produced by British production company Hat Trick Productions, Derry Girls is filmed in Northern
                          Ireland, with most scenes shot on location in Derry and some in Belfast. Although the plot lines of
                          Derry Girls are fictional, the series frequently references actual events of the Troubles and the
                          Northern Ireland peace process, including the 1994 IRA ceasefire announcement, the 1995 visit to
                          Northern Ireland of President Bill Clinton and First Lady Hillary Clinton, and the Good Friday
                          referendum of 1998.

                          The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (Swedish: Nobelpriset i fysiologi eller medicin) is
                          awarded yearly by the Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institute for outstanding discoveries in
                          physiology or medicine. The Nobel Prize is not a single prize, but five separate prizes that,
                          according to Alfred Nobel's 1895 will, are awarded "to those who, during the preceding year, have
                          conferred the greatest benefit to humankind". Nobel Prizes are awarded in the fields of Physics,
                          Chemistry, Physiology or Medicine, Literature, and Peace. The Nobel Prize is presented annually on
                          the anniversary of Alfred Nobel's death, 10 December. As of 2022, 114 Nobel Prizes in Physiology or
                          Medicine have been awarded to 226 laureates, 214 men and 12 women. The first one was awarded in
                          1901 to the German physiologist, Emil von Behring, for his work on serum therapy and the
                          development of a vaccine against diphtheria. The first woman to receive the Nobel Prize in
                          Physiology or Medicine, Gerty Cori, received it in 1947 for her role in elucidating the metabolism
                          of glucose, important in many aspects of medicine, including treatment of diabetes. The most recent
                          Nobel prize was announced by the Karolinska Institute on 3 October 2022, and has been awarded to
                          Swedish Svante Pääbo, for the discoveries concerning the genomes of extinct hominins and human
                          evolution.

                          57][58][59] When Banting published the paper that brought him the Nobel,[60] Paulescu already held
                          a patent for his discovery (10 April 1922, patent no. 6254 (8322) "Pancreina şi procedeul
                          fabricaţiei ei"/"Pancrein and the process of making it", from the Romanian Ministry of Industry and
                          Trade).[61][62][63] The Spanish neurophysiologist Fernando de Castro (1896–1967) was the first to
                          describe arterial chemoreceptors and circumscribe them to the carotid body for the respiratory
                          reflexes in 1926–1928. For many experts, this direct disciple of Santiago Ramón y Cajal deserved to
                          share the Nobel Prize 1938 with the awarded Corneille Heymans, but at that time Spain was immersed
                          in the Spanish Civil War and it seems that the Nobel Board even doubted if he was alive or not,
                          being at the front since almost the beginning of the conflict. Heymans himself recognised the
                          merits of De Castro for the Nobel Prize in different occasions, including a famous talk in
                          Montevideo (Uruguay).[64] In 1949, despite protests from the medical establishment, the Portuguese
                          neurologist António Egas Moniz received the Physiology or Medicine Prize for his development of the
                          prefrontal leucotomy, which he promoted by declaring the procedure's success just 10 days

                          The 2022 Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded to the French author Annie Ernaux "for the courage
                          and clinical acuity with which she uncovers the roots, estrangements and collective restraints of
                          personal memory".[1][2] It was announced by the Swedish Academy on 6 October 2022.[3][4][5] Ernaux
                          was the 16th French writer – the first Frenchwoman – and the 17th female author, to receive the
                          Nobel Prize in Literature.[6][7] Ernaux started her literary career in 1974 with Les Armoires vides
                          ("Cleaned Out"), an autobiographical novel. Very early in her career, she turned away from fiction
                          to focus on autobiography, combining historic and individual experiences. In her different
                          viewpoints, she consistently examines a life marked by strong disparities regarding gender,
                          language and class. Her path to authorship was long and arduous, and all her oeuvres are written in
                          plain language. Her books are followed by a wide readership, and are reviewed in most local and
                          national newspapers in France, as well as being the subject of many radio and television interviews
                          and programmes, and a large and growing international academic literature.

                          emotional force, has uncovered the abyss beneath our illusory sense of connection with the world”.

                          writing. “To receive the Nobel Prize is, for me, a responsibility to continue,” she said. She felt
                          compelled, in particular, to keep examining the inequality and struggles that women face. “Speaking
                          from my condition as a woman,” she said, “it does not seem to me that we, women, have become equal
                          in freedom, in power.” Ernaux becomes only the 17th woman to have been awarded the prize, which has
                          been given to 119 writers since it was formed in 1901. She is the second woman to receive the prize
                          in three years after Louise Glück, the American poet, was given 2020’s award. While early on in her
                          career Ernaux wrote autobiographical fiction, she quickly cast off any pretense that she was
                          inventing a plot and began writing memoirs, though she has often resisted labeling her work as
                          either fiction or nonfiction. “Everything she writes, every word, is literal and factually true,”
                          said Dan Simon, the founder of Seven Stories Press, which has been publishing Ernaux in English for
                          31 years. “And yet these are tremendous works of the imagination.

                          well-suited to lead Fox Entertainment in what promises to be an exciting next chapter in its rich

                          creativity, making the outlook ahead bright and exhilarating.” In addition to his “DWTS” tenure,

Question 181              : Who won the Japanese Grand Prix 2022?
Correct Answers         :  
                          Max Verstappen
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - Answer              : Max Verstappen
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          Max Verstappen clinched what had long been expected with his win at the 2022 Japanese Grand Prix:
                          this year's drivers' title crown. It makes him a double world champion at 25 and now he's close to
                          breaking Formula 1's record for most wins in a single season, with four events still left to run.
                          But Verstappen's title celebrations were overshadowed by the chaos and confusion during and after
                          the wet race last Sunday, which has led to even more questions being raised about the procedures
                          and attitudes of motorsport's governing body. There was also plenty of intrigue further down the
                          field and off the track too. Here are the headline takeaways from F1's first visit back to Suzuka
                          in three years. Verstappen hugs Adrian Newey after claiming a second F1 world title Photo by: Sam
                          Bloxham / Motorsport Images It had been coming ever since Charles Leclerc crashed out of the lead
                          of the French GP: Verstappen was going to be the 2022 world champion. After his Suzuka triumph and
                          the Ferrari driver's latest error gifting Sergio Perez second, came Verstappen's coronation.
                          Although, as we'll get to soon, not immediately. Having missed his first, slim chance to seal the
                          title in Singapore seven days earlier, Verstappen wrested control in Japan. He edged Leclerc for
                          pole, then beat his rival in the race's two main challenges.

                          Show premieres September 19 on NBC, promotional event happens September 15 In advance of the debut
                          of Quantum Leap September 19, NBC is hosting a promotion that sees gas sell for 91 cents a gallon,
                          as it was in 1985, and movie tickets for $3.55. That happens September 15. The pilot episode is set
                          in 1985. Quantum Leap aired on NBC from 1989 to 1993, with Scott Bakula starring. In the new
                          Quantum Leap, Raymond Lee plays Dr. Ben Seong. Both the gas and movie ticket promotions have a
                          “while supplies last” caveat attached, and the gas event happens in Los Angeles. “Visit our Los
                          Angeles gas station activation to receive gas at 1985 prices,” NBC said. Activation involves
                          driving to a “check-in lot” on North Vine Street to get the gas pass. The drive-through experience
                          while waiting for gas includes entering the “Quantum Accelerator,” ‘80s trivia, break-dancers and
                          snacks. Customers can get up to ten gallons of gas. The movie promotion is a partnership with
                          Fandango and involves a promo code. NBC calls the event Quantum Leap Day. More information can be
                          found at www.quantumleapday.com. The show’s logline reads: “It’s been 30 years since Dr. Sam

                          Nvidia's RTX 4060 is right around the corner, so it's really no surprise that the first benchmarks
                          are already starting to leak out. Today, two tests have been spotted, and they bode pretty well for
                          the GPU. The RTX 3060, which is still a favorite among Nvidia users, might be around 20% slower
                          than the upcoming Ada Lovelace model. Will the RTX 4060 become one of the best GPUs, or at least
                          one of the most popular models in this generation? One might think that a GPU that costs over
                          $40,000 is going to be the best graphics card for gaming, but the truth is a lot more complex than
                          that. In fact, this Nvidia GPU can't even keep up with integrated graphics solutions. Now, before
                          you get too upset, you should know I'm referring to Nvidia's H100, which houses the GH100 chip

                          capabilities, it also doesn't have any coolers. This is because, again, you'd find this GPU in a
                          data center or server setting, where it'd be cooled with powerful external fans. Nvidia has just
                          quietly announced the official release date of the RTX 4060. The GPU is coming out on June 29 and

                          Telling the true story of one of the NBA greats, 'Sweetwater' is just around the corner. Sports
                          biopics have a long illustrious history within cinema, and in recent years they have taken our
                          screens by storm. Some standout favorites include the likes of Craig Gillespie's I, Tonya starring
                          Margot Robbie, the recent Netflix biopic The Swimmers, and the highly-praised Ford v Ferrari. The
                          hunger for more sports biopics is great, and the eyes of the world constantly await the next
                          offering. Well, one such offering is just around the corner, in the form of Martin Guigui's
                          Sweetwater (2023). Telling the tale of Nat Clifton, an NBA Hall of Famer, the film itself has been
                          in the works since 2007 and is finally being released this year. Of course, we know that the movie
                          will be about the life of Nat Clifton, but a film cannot simply show every aspect of a person's
                          life, and will often choose a specific period of importance. The official plot synopsis of
                          Sweetwater reads: "The film follows Clifton, who is the star attraction of the Harlem
                          Globetrotters, led by owner/coach Abe Saperstein.

Question 186              : When did the Google Pixel Watch start sell?

                          This makes the Pixel Watch a bit more affordable than the Apple Watch Series 8 ($399) but pricier
                          than the Galaxy Watch 5 ($279) and recently-released Fitbit Sense 2 ($299). (See the rest of the
                          differences between the Google Pixel Watch vs. Fitbit Sense 2.) The Pixel Watch release date was
                          October 13, 2022, and since then we're continuing to track the best Pixel Watch deals. Note that
                          the Pixel Watch launched alongside the Google Pixel 7 and Google Pixel 7 Pro, which would both make
                          ideal companion devices for the company's smartwatch. The Google Pixel Watch is a simple-looking
                          smartwatch, I might even call it minimalistic. It comes in just one size: 41mm. Those with larger
                          wrists might complain about the lack of a larger option; that said, it fit me perfectly. The face
                          features a rounded design with a 3D glass dome. This raised effect distracts from the display's
                          thick bezel, but doesn't change the fact that a good chunk of the display is unusable. Perhaps my
                          prior experience with Samsung watches is to blame? I can't help but think it's a missed opportunity
                          to incorporate in digital rotating bezel in that space. It seems like no mistake that the Pixel
                          Watch is a "dark mode" device. The interface and all of Google's watch faces have black backgrounds
                          to further conceal the bezel.

                          recipient in recognition of her support of military caregivers by the Elizabeth Dole Foundation.
                          The award will be presented at the foundation’s annual Heroes & History Makers celebration, on Oct.
                          19 at The Anthem in Washington, DC, and streamed live. The event is EDF’s annual tribute to
                          America’s 5.5 million military caregivers. Sen. Elizabeth Dole will be joined by Hidden Heroes
                          Campaign Chair Tom Hanks and multi-platinum, global entertainer Chris Young. The Caregiver Champion
                          Award was named for Hanks in recognition of his outstanding support of military caregivers. The
                          award has previously been presented to former First Lady Michelle Obama, music superstar Tim
                          McGraw, and actor and humanitarian Gary Sinise. Guthrie was selected in recognition of her devoted
                          advocacy of those who serve and their families. Since joining EDF as a Hidden Heroes Ambassador in
                          2018, Guthrie has used her platform to bring awareness to the 5.5 million loved ones caring for a
                          wounded, ill, or injured service member at home. “Over the past four years, she has become deeply
                          invested in our cause,” said Steve Schwab, CEO of the Elizabeth Dole Foundation. ‘She has brought
                          our caregivers' stories of service and sacrifice into millions of homes across America.

                          Dole was the first to call the nation’s attention to the men and women caring for a wounded, ill,
                          or injured service member or veteran at home. Military caregivers face increased emotional and
                          physical stress, financial and legal troubles, employment difficulties, and feelings of isolation
                          due to the enormous responsibility and severe lack of resources for those caring for someone who
                          served. The Foundation is committed to recognizing, supporting, and empowering military caregivers.

                          Alliance and NYC Parks announced today that longtime New York City public servant Morgan Monaco
                          will become the new President of the Alliance, the non-profit that operates the park in partnership
                          with the City, and also the Prospect Park Administrator, a public appointment by NYC Parks. Monaco,
                          whose public sector career spans both government and non-profit organizations, brings extensive
                          knowledge of park equity and community development to the position, as well as strong leadership in
                          driving sustainable impact for civic organizations. Monaco is the first Black leader of the
                          Alliance, further diversifying executive leadership within the open space sector, and continues the
                          legacy of female leadership at the Alliance over the course of its 35-year history. Monaco succeeds
                          former Prospect Park Alliance President Sue Donoghue, who was appointed New York City Parks
                          Commissioner earlier this year. Monaco looks forward to working with the board, staff and most
                          especially park users to help shape her vision for the park’s future. Coming out of the pandemic
                          and recognizing the ways in which the park has been an invaluable resource for New Yorkers to
                          recover, she looks forward to strengthening the organization’s capacity in order to keep pace with
                          the needs of the park community and the robust use of the park. She plans to leverage her
                          experience in working on citywide equity initiatives and serving vulnerable communities to explore
                          the ways in which the Alliance can bring more social services to the park.

                          February 4, 2022 A message from Prospect Park Alliance President Sue Donoghue: I am writing to you
                          today with exciting news: Mayor Eric Adams has announced my appointment as the next New York City
                          Parks Commissioner. Serving as the President of Prospect Park Alliance and Park Administrator has
                          been one of the great honors of my career. I’ve been so lucky to work alongside so many dedicated
                          people, from Alliance and NYC Parks staff, to our incredibly hardworking volunteers and community
                          advocates, and a devoted Board of Directors that has provided the Alliance exceptional guidance and
                          leadership. I’m honored to be taking on a citywide leadership role in caring for New York City’s
                          most essential resource, its parks and open spaces, and I will continue to cherish and support
                          Prospect Park as a neighbor and park advocate. It has been a great privilege to steward this
                          breathtakingly beautiful space, and serve as only the third president of this thriving,
                          35-years-young organization. During this time we’ve advanced the park in numerous ways: rebounding
                          from the challenges of the pandemic through our Re:New Prospect Park initiative; restoring the
                          Flatbush Avenue perimeter and creating the first new entrances of the park since the 1940s;
                          revitalizing and expanding the park’s woodlands and natural areas; bringing back to the public the
                          exquisitely restored Endale Arch and Concert Grove Pavilion; and securing funds for our next great
                          phase of restoration, the 26-acre Vale in the park’s northeast corner.

  - Source              :
                          By Jess Weatherbed, a news writer focused on creative industries, computing, and internet culture.
                          Jess started her career at TechRadar, covering news and hardware reviews. Video game developer and
                          publisher Riot Games has announced its acquisition of Wargaming Sydney, a gaming software
                          development studio that’s part of Cyprus-based Wargaming, the publisher behind titles such as World
                          of Tanks and World of Warships. Riot did not disclose the price of the purchase. Wargaming Sydney
                          is one of the largest games studios in Australia, formed under its original name of BigWorld back
                          in 2002. It was by Wargaming in 2012. The studio has created game development tools and other
                          software architecture required to develop online games such as MMOs. After the acquisition by Riot,
                          Wargaming Sydney will be renamed Riot Sydney and will assist in the development of Riot games such
                          as Valorant and League of Legends. Wargaming will maintain ownership of BigWorld Technology
                          Wargaming Sydney is the only operation being acquired by Riot Games, with other studios under the
                          Wargaming name unaffected by the purchase. Wargaming will also maintain ownership of BigWorld
                          technology’s gaming software architecture for its existing products. Riot says the newly branded
                          Riot Sydney will be a key contributor to its network of development studios.

                          Here's Gowrappan's memo to Yahoo staff: Team - We've entered a new chapter in our history, and I am
                          tremendously proud of all that we have accomplished together over the past three years. Like the
                          start of any next chapter, this is a natural moment for transition. I've made the decision to take
                          on a new role as a senior advisor to Apollo. This role will enable me to support our next phase of
                          growth and continued investment in the company. As such, I am excited to welcome Jim Lanzone as the
                          new CEO of Yahoo effective September 27, 2021. Jim is a veteran technology and media leader with
                          two decades of leadership experience and a deep track record of growth, innovation and an
                          entrepreneurial spirit. I have every confidence he will be a terrific leader for the new Yahoo. Jim
                          and I will work together to ensure a seamless transition, and I'm confident he will build on our
                          successes and lead us into our future. What an incredible journey this has been. I joined the
                          company three years ago as part of Verizon. Today, we're a standalone company with significant
                          potential to grow beyond what we have accomplished thus far. We have the best team, with the right
                          products, content and technology to shape the future of Yahoo. To reiterate what's been said many
                          times over the past few months – this next chapter is a testament to the great work you've
                          delivered against a focused strategy.

                          Peloton's new CEO Barry McCarthy is known in tech circles and on Wall Street as Mr. No Bullshit.
                          Direct. No nonsense. A deep strategic thinker who wants to get stuff done yesterday. A man who
                          likes golf, but enjoys explaining the intricacies of tech subscription models and the ins and outs
                          of a balance sheet perhaps way more. And overall McCarthy, 69, lived up to all of that external
                          branding in an exclusive 30-minute Zoom chat with Yahoo Finance. "I could have stayed in
                          retirement," McCarthy said, decked out in his trademark vest and glasses and looking not too far
                          removed from fit Peloton instructor status. "It's pretty clear to me there are only one or two
                          outcomes for me here — either I'm coming home in defeat or I'm coming out victorious." McCarthy's
                          resume suggests victory is not out of reach. It includes being the innovative architect of
                          Spotify's 2018 direct listing. At Spotify, he was CFO for several years before retiring in 2019,
                          working closely with founder Daniel Ek. Before then, he worked alongside Netflix's founder Reed
                          Hastings to build the streaming giant into a powerhouse. Peloton hired McCarthy as its no-nonsense
                          sheriff several weeks ago — to work alongside founder and now executive chairman John Foley — after
                          several challenging quarters, operationally and reputation wise. To be sure, McCarthy has a lot on
                          his plate from the jump — something you pick up on within the first five minutes of our chat.

                          4 of Chicago PD’s current season 10 will be showing you when it comes out next Wednesday night,
                          October 12, 2022. We were able to snag up an official teaser description for one of episode 4’s
                          main storylines via NBC’s official episode 4 press release. So, we’re going to certainly take a
                          look at it right now. Let’s go. First off, NBC revealed that there is an official title for this
                          new episode 4 of Chicago PD’s current season 10. It turns out that the writers decided to name it,
                          “DONDE VIVES.” It sounds like episode 4 will feature some more very scandalous, intense, dramatic,
                          interesting, action-filled and suspenseful scenes. In the new episode 4, a shocking murder and a
                          rookie officer will be the main focus of this storyline that NBC chose to serve up on a platter.
                          Yep, it turns out that some major scandal will loom in this episode as very startling murder will
                          take place at some point.

Question 193              : How much does the YouTube Premium family plan cost now?
Correct Answers         :  
                          22.99 per month
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prediction (only positive):
  - Answer              : $17.99
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          If you subscribe to a YouTube Premium family plan, you may want to check your email: Google is
                          notifying users that the monthly cost of the service will be going up by $5 a month. Starting in
                          November, most users will start paying $22.99 per month for YouTube Premium — though there seems to
                          be some leeway. While the main announcement says that the price increase starts on the next billing
                          cycle on or after November 21st, some legacy subscribers won't see their bill jump for several
                          months. One Engadget staffer was informed that their price would not increase until April due to
                          their status as a "long-standing and valued member." With the new price structure, the family plan
                          is less of a bargain for smaller groups. At $17.99, buying into the family plan for just two users
                          offered a significant savings over individual accounts. Now, a two-user family will save only $1 a
                          month. For now, however, single-user prices remain the same: $11.99 a month for individual accounts
                          and $6.99 for students. The benefits haven't changed either, with Premium still offering users an
                          ad-free YouTube experience, the ability to download videos for offline viewing, access to YouTube
                          Music, and the ability to continue to play music and videos in the background or with your phone
                          screen off. At least you still don't need to subscribe to Premium to watch videos in 4K.

                          YouTube Originals for everyone. Now, free users can watch YouTube Originals content with ads, just
                          like any other video. The company vaguely states that "only select episodes may be available for
                          streaming at a given time," but in our experience, the majority of Originals content is open to
                          all. Being a YouTube Premium member still has some perks in regards to Originals, though. In

                          director's cuts. Have a look at the YouTube Originals channel to see what's available. Some videos,
                          marked as Premium, are only available for subscribers. Whether you're interested in anything on

                          platforms, YouTube Music is available for free. With YouTube Music Premium, you also get ad-free
                          access, the ability to play music in the background, and the option to download music for offline
                          listening. YouTube Music Premium costs $9.99/month on its own, so it adds quite a bit of value to
                          YouTube Premium. If you don't already subscribe to Spotify, Apple Music, or similar, then you can
                          enjoy two types of subscriptions under one umbrella.

                          Sony just had a successful release of one of its premiered games. More than four years after the
                          original, God of War gets the much-awaited sequel in God of War: Ragnarok. GoW: Ragnarok was
                          released on November 9, 2022, and was positively received by critics and the gaming community. It
                          is safe to say it lived up to the hype and exceeded expectations. But, since it’s a Sony-exclusive
                          title, God of War: Ragnarok was only released on the PlayStation 4 and 5. However, the first
                          installment to this beloved franchise got the opportunity to be ported for PC gamers after four
                          years since it was conceived. This leaves us with the question – When will God of War: Ragnarok
                          come to PC? Plus, what are God of War: Ragnarok’s basic PC requirements so my computer can run
                          smoothly? We will answer all of that for you in this article. Please enable JavaScript God of War
                          was released for PlayStation 4 on August 20, 2018. It was until January 14, 2022, that fans of
                          Kratos were able to embark on his epic God-slaying adventures on PC. That’s almost four years of
                          waiting which is roughly the estimated time for PlayStation games before they get an official
                          release on PC. Although there is no official announcement from Sony that GoW: Ragnarok will be
                          arriving on PC soon, the chances of it becoming true are very high.

                          thing, a showdown between Kratos and Thor was teased at the end of the last game, and we also
                          learned that Atreus' original name was Loki. With those two nuggets of information in mind, you
                          should expect big mysteries to unfold in the game and for more morsels of Norse mythology to factor
                          in this release. Revealed to the delight of many at the PlayStation Showcase event last year,
                          here's the first teaser trailer for God of War Ragnarök. While you wait for that God of War

                          the House of Commons—to run in the ballot on 24 October. The total number of MPs who publicly
                          declared support passed 100 on the afternoon of 22 October.[111] On 23 October, Sunak declared that
                          he would stand for election.[112] After Johnson ruled himself out of the race and Penny Mordaunt
                          withdrew her candidacy, Sunak was announced as the new Conservative leader on 24 October.[113]
                          Following Truss's resignation, Sunak, as the Leader of the Conservative Party, became prime
                          minister on 25 October 2022, after accepting King Charles III's invitation to form a
                          government.[114] He is both the first British Asian and the first Hindu prime minister of the
                          United Kingdom. In his first speech as prime minister, Sunak promised "integrity, professionalism
                          and accountability," and said that "we will create a future worthy of the sacrifices so many have
                          made and fill tomorrow, and everyday thereafter with hope."[115] Of his predecessor, Sunak said
                          that Truss "was not wrong" to want to improve growth, but admitted that "some mistakes were made",
                          and that he was elected prime minister in part to fix them. He promised to "place economic
                          stability and confidence at the heart of this government's agenda".[116] Sunak began to appoint his
                          cabinet on 25 October 2022.

                          ‘groundbreaking milestone’ as Rishi Sunak becomes British Prime Minister. Sunak will be the first
                          person of color to lead the United Kingdom. (Oct. 25) LONDON (AP) — Rishi Sunak became Britain’s
                          third prime minister this year on Tuesday, tasked with taming an economic crisis that has left the
                          country’s finances in a precarious state and millions struggling to pay their food and energy
                          bills. Sunak, who is the U.K.’s first leader of color, met King Charles III at Buckingham Palace,
                          where the monarch officially asked the new leader of the governing Conservative Party to form a
                          government, as is tradition. Sunak clinched the leadership position Monday, seen by his party as a
                          safe pair of hands to stabilize an economy sliding toward recession — and stem its own plunging
                          popularity, after the brief, disastrous term of Liz Truss. Her package of unfunded tax cuts spooked
                          financial markets with the prospect of ballooning debt, drove the pound to record lows and forced
                          the Bank of England to intervene — weakening Britain’s fragile economy and obliterating Truss’
                          authority within her party. In one of his first acts, Sunak announced he would retain Treasury
                          chief Jeremy Hunt, appointed by Truss to steady the markets two weeks ago amid the turmoil. His
                          removal would have set off new tremors.

                          (born May 12, 1980, Southampton, England), British politician and financier who became leader of
                          the Conservative Party and prime minster of the United Kingdom in October 2022. Previously he
                          served as chancellor of the Exchequer (2020–22). Sunak was born into a family with immigrant roots.
                          His grandparents emigrated from Punjab, in northwestern India, to East Africa, where his mother and
                          father were born in Tanzania and Kenya, respectively. They met and married after their families
                          migrated in the 1960s to Southampton in southern England. Sunak’s father became a general
                          practitioner for the National Health Service. His mother, a pharmacist, owned and operated a small
                          pharmacy, for which Sunak, the eldest of their three children, would eventually keep the books.
                          Later, during his political career, Sunak would draw parallels between his experiences working in
                          the family business and the values he gained from them and those of Conservative Party icon
                          Margaret Thatcher, the daughter of a grocer. As a result of his parents’ sacrifices and saving to
                          fund his education, Sunak was able to attend Winchester College, the exclusive private school that
                          has produced no fewer than six chancellors of the Exchequer.

                          Does streaming giant Netflix really deliver something for everyone? The CableTV.com experts

                          red N has been the No. 1 streaming service for years for a reason—it’s consistent in quantity and
                          quality. At a base price of $6.99 a month, Netflix’s ad-supported plan delivers a thunderous bang
                          for your subscription buck. Unlike the others that are still trying to catch up, Netflix pours
                          millions into building its own on-demand universe (until it eventually cancels every show that
                          isn’t Stranger Things). That’s why we’ve given it our editorial award for most original content in
                          2023. Netflix is one of the few entertainment outlets that can say it has “something for everyone”
                          with a straight face (or off-center smiley-square icon). Not all of Netflix’s shows and movies are
                          great, but there’s always something new dropping tomorrow. Jump to: If you have multiple devices in

                          Like many of you, I find Netflix occupies my television screen about once every two weeks since I’m
                          not champing at the bit to experience a litany of identical documentaries focused on minor Twitter
                          story lines from the previous year. (Seriously, how the hell are there two GameStonk
                          documentaries?) In short, Netflix isn’t something I want to spend $240 on each year anymore — its
                          salad days are a distant memory — and the company is finally starting to empathize with my
                          reasoning. Basic With Ads is functionally identical to Netflix’s $10 Basic plan. You’re capped at a
                          720p resolution for all of your playback options and are allowed to use only one device on the
                          subscription at a time. (So no, you can’t engineer some sort of weird multi-apartment Bridgerton
                          marathon.) The only sacrifice you need to make to get the $3 discount is to sit through the four
                          minutes of total advertising time that occupied, say, season one, episode two of Stranger Things,
                          which I fired up on my Roku for a test-drive. (Yes, I’m a little late to the Upside Down party.)
                          The first thing I saw on my television was a dewy, luxurious promo for Louis Vuitton, which frankly
                          read as a pointed barb to my newfound money-saving mind-set. Yes, Netflix believes that even those
                          pivoting to Basic With Ads can afford the good life.

Question 200              : Where does The White Lotus Season 2 take place
Correct Answers         :  
                          Sicily

  - Answer              : Italy

  - Source              :
                          This is a core theme in the first season of The White Lotus; White found that “Hawaii is a very
                          paradisiacal and idyllic place,” but its economy is dominated by tourists and military contractors
                          who are largely unaware of the issues of American imperialism. Ironically, Season 1 was filmed
                          amidst the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic when the tourism industry had been facing many setbacks.
                          This gave production designer Laura Fox the opportunity to spend time redesigning the artwork,
                          sets, and scenery in each room featured in the series; The White Lotus fans have enjoyed analyzing
                          the background details for hidden Easter eggs, and Fox herself compared the subtle menace of the
                          hotel to The Shining. Between assassination attempts, mafia, familial conflict, and beautiful
                          Italian scenery, The White Lotus: Sicily had a lot in common with The Godfather. Similar to Francis
                          Ford Coppola’s 1972 crime classic, season 2 was filmed on location in Italy. The San Domenico
                          Palace, Taormina stands in for the clifftop resort in the series. Additionally, White makes use of
                          several local wonders, including the Ionian Sea, the Greek Theater of Teatro Antico di Taormina,
                          and the active Mount Etna volcano, which erupts in the final episode, “Arrivederci.” Considering
                          that The White Lotus: Sicily focuses on the issues of colonialism, it makes sense that the series
                          was filmed in a location with a complex history.

                          in the Hawaiian resort, which is decorated and designed to reflect the local cultural practices (or
                          at least the way that they are perceived by tourists); there’s a particularly entertaining
                          storyline where the hotel manager Armond (Murray Bartlett) and the brutish guest Shane Patton (Jake

                          one-bedroom suites that overlook Wailea Beach and cost over $9,000 a night. White had grown
                          interested in telling a story set in Hawaii after filming episodes of his show Enlightened. He said
                          that “the colonial legacy is still a living issue,” and that he learned more about the United
                          States’ annexation of Hawaii in 1898 and the lack of self-determination granted to Indigenous
                          groups as a result of his experience.

                          This projection was based on a variety of metrics, including generic ballot testing that favored a
                          Republican-led Congress as well as President Biden’s low approval rating, which hovers around 40%.
                          Super PACS and political party groups were spending money almost exclusively in districts that
                          President Biden won in 2020, indicating that Democrats were in a defensive crouch. Midterm
                          elections often benefit the opposition political party at the expense of the White House’s party.
                          1994 and 2010 were typical midterm elections, where Republicans made gains in the House at the
                          midpoint of Bill Clinton and Barack Obama’s first terms. Similarly, in 2018, Republican’s got
                          crushed in House elections but picked up two seats in the Senate. If a president’s approval ratings
                          are high, then the presiding party typically fares better in midterm House elections. For example,
                          in 1998, Bill Clinton’s approval rating was 66%, and Democrats retained control of the House. In
                          2002, George W. Bush polled at a 63%, and Republicans made gains. Currently, Biden’s approval
                          rating is 42%, which is similar to former president Barack Obama’s rating in 2010. That year,
                          Democrats lost control of the House, similar to what occurred during this year’s midterms. After
                          each census, congressional district lines are redrawn. This Nov. 8 election was the first general
                          election since the redistricting process concluded.

                          "Lullaby" is a song by English rock band the Cure from their eighth studio album, Disintegration
                          (1989). Released as a single on 10 April 1989, the song is the band's highest-charting single in
                          their home country, reaching number five on the UK Singles Chart. It additionally reached number
                          three in West Germany and Ireland while becoming a top-10 hit in several other European countries
                          and New Zealand. The music video, directed by Tim Pope, won the British Video of the Year at the
                          1990 Brit Awards. The meaning of "Lullaby" has been speculated by fans, including as a metonymy for
                          addiction, depression, or sexual assault,[2] and Smith has offered multiple explanations as to its
                          theme or content, such as childhood nightmares or abuse.[2] One explanation by Smith follows that
                          the song is about the disturbing songs his father sung to him as a kid, and the horrible ending
                          they would always have.[3] Tim Pope, a long-time collaborator of the Cure on many of its music
                          videos, interprets "Lullaby" as an allegory for lead singer Robert Smith's drug-addled past.[4]
                          Upon its release, "Lullaby" became the Cure's highest-charting hit in their home country when it
                          reached number five on the UK Singles Chart. It remains their only single to reach the top five in
                          the United Kingdom.

                          will do everything to try and fill the boots the fellow companions have travelled in before me. And
                          what better way to do that than being by the fabulous Ncuti Gatwa’s side, I just can’t wait to get
                          started." Gatwa added: "Millie just is the companion. She is full of talent, strength, she has a
                          cheeky sparkle in her eye and is sharp as a razor. From the moment she walked into the room she
                          captured all of our attention with her effervescence and then solidified that attention with the
                          sheer torque of her talent. This adventure is going to be so wild and so fun, I cannot wait to sail
                          the universe with Millie!

                          Across the Yahoo Network Thu, October 27, 2022 at 2:01:02 PM EDT The voice behind TikTok’s
                          text-to-speech feature has spoken — and she’s a Canadian local radio host. Kat Callaghan hosts The
                          Beat on 91.5 FM in Ontario. She also made a major reveal this month: She’s the voice of TikTok’s
                          text-to-speech feature. Iconic! Callaghan confessed in her very first TikTok video. For a long time
                          I didn’t say a word. But … yes it’s me and yes I have an ongoing awesome relationship with the
                          folks at TikTok. 🎉 The coolest part for me is watching the creativity & awesome content that people
                          are putting out there using my voice. (Also oddly enough this is my first TikTok) “When you guys
                          have been asking me if I’m the voice on TikTok,” the text-to-speech caption said. “Finally I can
                          tell you guys: It is me,” Callaghan said in her authentic voice. In the caption, she explained that
                          she has an awesome ongoing relationship with TikTok. “The coolest part for me is watching the
                          creativity & awesome content that people are putting out there using my voice,” Callaghan wrote.
                          The video received over 29.4 million views. Some were in shock, but not everyone believed she was
                          the voice they had heard for so long.

                          know it was a real person behind the voice until now…” another said. “Finally the voice matches the
                          face in my brain,” a TikToker wrote. “Idk why I’m not 100% convinced,” a user replied. “Am I the
                          only one that watched 100 times to check if the voices matched?” a person added. Let’s see if this
                          does it. In an update, she explained that considering she is a voice actor for a living, lying
                          about something like this would be pretty bad for her career. Then Callaghan gave the people what
                          they wanted and spoke using her text-to-speech voice. The sound is uncanny! More from In The Know:

                          in 2012, he’s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk. TikTok has
                          agreed to settle a lawsuit with Bev Standing, the voice actress who said she was behind the app’s
                          original text-to-speech voice. Standing sued TikTok in May, saying that the app was using her voice
                          without permission. A robotic version of what sounded like Standing’s voice had been in the app for
                          months, speaking over what felt like every other video at the time. A lawyer for Standing said the
                          settlement was still being finalized and details around payment could not be disclosed. “They’ve
                          reached an amicable resolution,” Robert Sciglimpaglia, who represents Standing, said in a phone
                          call with The Verge. Sciglimpaglia said TikTok would license Standing’s voice as part of the
                          agreement, but it’s up to TikTok whether or not to use it. TikTok did not immediately respond to a
                          request for comment. Standing said her voice was meant to be used for Chinese translations It
                          sounds as though some strange mixup led to Standing’s voice being used by TikTok in the first
                          place. Standing said that she made recordings for a text-to-speech feature “several years ago” but
                          that they were meant to be used for translations of Chinese texts. No one else was supposed to use
                          them.

                          gaslighting is, “The act or practice of grossly misleading someone, especially for one’s own
                          advantage,” or “psychological manipulation of a person usually over an extended period of time that
                          causes the victim to question the validity of their own thoughts, perception of reality, or
                          memories…” This year, the word experienced a 1,740% increase in lookups. Interest remained high
                          throughout the entirety of the year, too. It’s safe to assume this word won’t be removed from the

                          III and identified his wife Camilla as the Queen Consort. That word rapidly became the subject of
                          many Merriam-Webster searches. This word gained popularity in June when an engineer at Google
                          stated that a company AI chatbot had human-esque consciousness. As a result, lookups of the term
                          went up by 480%. This term refers to the process which allows Congress to create laws. When Roe v.
                          Wade was overturned in June 2022, searches for the word increased by a massive 193%. Sources: Our

                          advantage,” or “psychological manipulation of a person usually over an extended period of time that
                          causes the victim to question the validity of their own thoughts, perception of reality, or
                          memories…” This year, the word experienced a 1,740% increase in lookups. Interest remained high
                          throughout the entirety of the year, too. It’s safe to assume this word won’t be removed from the

                          Argentina recovered from their shock defeat to Saudi Arabia with back-to-back wins over Mexico and
                          Poland to finish as winners of Group C. * Lionel Messi and Julian Alvarez scored in Argentina's 2-1
                          win over Australia in their Round of 16 tie. * Argentina beat the Netherlands 4-3 in a penalty
                          shootout in their quarter-final tie, after Nahuel Molina and Messi's goals were cancelled out by a
                          brace from Dutch substitute Wout Weghorst. * Argentina beat Croatia 3-0 in the semi-finals, with
                          Messi coolly putting away a spot kick in the 34th minute to open the scoring before Alvarez found
                          the net either side of halftime.

Question 220              : Who is the captain of the USA soccer team in the FIFA Men's World Cup 2022?
Correct Answers         :  
                          Tyler Adams
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - Answer              : Tyler Adams

                          Tyler Adams will captain the US men’s national team into the 2022 FIFA World Cup, head coach Gregg
                          Berhalter announced on the eve of Monday’s Group B opener vs. Wales (2 pm ET | FOX, Telemundo). The
                          Leeds United midfielder and New York Red Bulls homegrown product will be the USMNT’s youngest
                          captain since Walter Bahr at the 1950 World Cup. He’s already worn the armband nine times during 32
                          career international appearances. “We think he has great leadership capabilities,” Berhalter said
                          of the 23-year-old Wappingers Falls, New York native. “He leads by his actions and his words.” FIFA
                          requires teams to name a singular captain for the tournament; the USMNT were the last of 32
                          Qatar-qualified squads to complete that task. During Berhalter’s tenure, the USMNT have relied on a
                          leadership council and rotating armband responsibilities. Chelsea forward Christian Pulisic and
                          Nashville SC center back Walker Zimmerman were other leading candidates to be named captain. “A lot
                          of credit to my teammates,” Adams said, “because anyone throughout our leadership council can wear
                          that armband and represent us with pride and represent us in the right way." Adams debuted for the
                          Red Bulls in 2016 before moving to Europe in the winter of 2019, then to German Bundesliga side RB
                          Leipzig.

                          Sarachan recalled that during the team's first training session, he had to rein Adams in. "He
                          covered more ground in 10 minutes than I had seen a lot of my players cover in one training
                          session," Sarachan said. "It's like when you go to buy a car and the salesman goes in the car with
                          you, usually you start out kind of easy and he'll tell you to get on the highway. Tyler just
                          floored it." Sarachan stops short of saying he knew Adams would captain the US side, but he saw
                          some of the same building blocks Bedoya did in terms of work ethic and preparation. Over time,
                          those traits made even more of an impression. "When you think of leadership qualities, certain
                          boxes need to be checked," Sarachan said. "You have to have confidence, you have to be humble, you
                          have to have a work ethic, there's a lot more subsets to it. And being a young kid, I didn't know
                          how that would play out. But once we got into 2018, it didn't take long for me to know that, 'OK,
                          this kid's got what it takes to be a leader other than his youth.' I look back and think about that
                          Portugal week, the signs were there for sure." Now Adams is a man in full.

                          Tyler Adams will captain the US men’s national team into the 2022 FIFA World Cup, head coach Gregg
                          Berhalter announced on the eve of Monday’s Group B opener vs. Wales (2 pm ET | FOX, Telemundo). The
                          Leeds United midfielder and New York Red Bulls homegrown product will be the USMNT’s youngest
                          captain since Walter Bahr at the 1950 World Cup. He’s already worn the armband nine times during 32
                          career international appearances. “We think he has great leadership capabilities,” Berhalter said
                          of the 23-year-old Wappingers Falls, New York native. “He leads by his actions and his words.” FIFA
                          requires teams to name a singular captain for the tournament; the USMNT were the last of 32
                          Qatar-qualified squads to complete that task. During Berhalter’s tenure, the USMNT have relied on a
                          leadership council and rotating armband responsibilities. Chelsea forward Christian Pulisic and
                          Nashville SC center back Walker Zimmerman were other leading candidates to be named captain. “A lot
                          of credit to my teammates,” Adams said, “because anyone throughout our leadership council can wear
                          that armband and represent us with pride and represent us in the right way." Adams debuted for the
                          Red Bulls in 2016 before moving to Europe in the winter of 2019, then to German Bundesliga side RB
                          Leipzig.

                          player in college football. Here’s what you need to know: Williams was the best quarterback in
                          America this season, so the Maxwell Award was deserved. Williams led USC’s turnaround from a
                          four-win team to a top-10 squad in 2022 and elevated the players around him. Now his sights turn to
                          Saturday night and the Heisman Trophy. — Morales Duggan’s story has been one of the best in college
                          football, starting TCU’s season as the backup quarterback before leading the Horned Frogs to a 12-0
                          start. His toughness and perseverance helped pull the Frogs out of multiple second-half deficits
                          and without his poise, leadership and production late in games, TCU wouldn’t be in the College
                          Football Playoff. Winning the O’Brien and being a Heisman finalist are both well-deserved honors

                          NCAAF 47 USC quarterback Caleb Williams won the 2022 Maxwell Award on Thursday, given to the best
                          player in college football. Here’s what you need to know: Williams was the best quarterback in
                          America this season, so the Maxwell Award was deserved. Williams led USC’s turnaround from a
                          four-win team to a top-10 squad in 2022 and elevated the players around him. Now his sights turn to
                          Saturday night and the Heisman Trophy. — Morales Duggan’s story has been one of the best in college
                          football, starting TCU’s season as the backup quarterback before leading the Horned Frogs to a 12-0
                          start. His toughness and perseverance helped pull the Frogs out of multiple second-half deficits
                          and without his poise, leadership and production late in games, TCU wouldn’t be in the College
                          Football Playoff. Winning the O’Brien and being a Heisman finalist are both well-deserved honors
                          for Duggan. — Khan Chuck Bednarik Award – Defensive Player of the Year Biletnikoff Award –

                          Nonetheless, the final was contested by two European teams.[68] In another World Cup first, the two
                          finalists from the preceding tournament, Italy and France, were eliminated at the group stage, with
                          Italy becoming the third defending champions to be eliminated in the first round after Brazil in
                          1966 and France in 2002.[76] New Zealand, one of the lowest-ranked teams, surprised many by drawing
                          all three of their group matches, ending the tournament as the only undefeated team. All times
                          listed are South African Standard Time (UTC+02) The knockout stage comprised the 16 teams that
                          advanced from the group stage of the tournament. There were four rounds of matches, with each round
                          eliminating half of the teams entering that round. The successive rounds were the round of 16,
                          quarter-finals, semi-finals, and the final. There was also a play-off to decide third and fourth
                          place. For each game in the knockout stage, any draw at 90 minutes was followed by thirty minutes
                          of extra time; if scores were still level, there was a penalty shootout to determine who progressed
                          to the next round.[82] In this round, each group winner (A-H) was paired against the runner-up from
                          another group. The round was marked by some controversial referees' decisions, including:

                          she can barely read and write," Cheboi said during her acceptance speech. "She has four daughters,
                          and she worked really hard to educate us. Schools in Kenya are very expensive, so people were

                          spent four decades working roadside to fund her children's education. The two sang a song together
                          on stage, which Cheboi said she grew up singing to her mom after she returned home from work,

                          to show you the world,'" she said of the lyrics during her speech. "So right now, in front of the
                          whole world, I sing to you, and I've shown you the world. CNN Heroes, you have made this happen."
                          Cheboi shared that her mother, still learning English, wasn't aware of the gravity of the award.

                          19, 2023 in the Kennedy Center Concert Hall. The Prize, which is named to honor one of the world’s
                          greatest humorists, will be awarded at a gala performance featuring some of the biggest names in
                          comedy. Broadcast details will be announced at a later date. The Mark Twain Prize for American
                          Humor recognizes individuals who have had an impact on American society in ways similar to the
                          distinguished 19th-century novelist and essayist Samuel Clemens, best known as Mark Twain. As a
                          social commentator, satirist, and creator of characters, Clemens was a fearless observer of
                          society, who startled many while delighting and informing many more with his uncompromising

                          over three decades with his films, music, and his tenure as a fan favorite cast member on SNL,”
                          said Kennedy Center President Deborah F. Rutter about this year’s recipient. “Adam has created
                          characters that have made us laugh, cry, and cry from laughing. I am looking forward to a
                          laughter-filled evening like no other as we celebrate his career at a ceremony that is sure to
                          bring together the best in comedy.

                          Ackerman checks a lot of the boxes. The first president of the WNBA (1996-2005) is the visionary

                          thanks to her leadership. Like all these candidates, she is qualified. It's a question of whether
                          Ackerman has the desire to take the NCAA's heavy lift. 3. Linda Livingstone, Baylor president:

                          simultaneously on the NCAA Board of Directors and Board of Governors. Either way, she is going to

                          billionaire announced hiring her for the top spot at the social media company. “It happened — first
                          day in the books!,” Yaccarino tweeted late Monday. “Stay tuned…” A day earlier, Yaccarino had
                          tweeted that Twitter had hired Joe Benarroch, NBCU’s former senior vice president of communications
                          for advertising and partnerships, to join her at the company. Benarroch will work in business

                          said in the tweet. The New York Times and The Information first reported that Yaccarino was

                          gig: rallying momentum around thousands of digital ape jpegs and CryptoPunks that once sold for
                          millions—all while the crypto market is spiraling. A key part of Alegre’s plan is the continued
                          buildout of the Yuga Labs virtual world, Otherside, the CEO explained Wednesday at Fortune’s
                          Brainstorm Tech conference in Deer Valley, Utah. These metaverse plans, which have been ongoing
                          since Yuga’s virtual land sale in 2022, are “audacious” and will “take time,” said Alegre, who was
                          the former president and COO of video game company Activision Blizzard before joining Yuga Labs end
                          of last year. “As an NFT holder, you will be able to participate in drawing what we’re building,
                          which is this Otherside metaverse,” he said, without offering many more details. Since Yuga Labs’
                          land sale raised $320 million last year, token holders have had two brief “trips” into that virtual
                          world—short visits intended to show the community “what the evolution can be,” Alegre said. Yuga
                          Labs’ gave users their first visit to Otherside in the summer of 2022, and followed up with a
                          second trip about eight months later. But it remains unclear when the company plans to officially
                          open the doors to Otherside.

                          These allegations led to a lawsuit being filed by the California Department of Fair Employment and
                          Housing against Activision Blizzard in July 2021. The company has also faced criticism for its
                          handling of the situation and the toxic work environment that allegedly exists within the company.
                          This has resulted in significant public backlash, with some fans and employees calling for boycotts
                          and protests. Alegre’s departure from Activision to Yuga Labs may be seen as a positive move for
                          those who are critical of Activision’s leadership and culture. It’s worth noting that the gaming
                          industry and the NFT space have both been the subject of intense scrutiny and controversy in recent
                          years. The allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination at Activision Blizzard have been a
                          particularly significant source of controversy in the gaming industry. Meanwhile, the NFT space has
                          faced criticism for its environmental impact and the high levels of speculation and price
                          volatility surrounding some NFTs. Furthermore, the recent fake news surrounding Bored Ape Yacht
                          Club (BAYC) highlights the need for responsible and informed reporting in the NFT space. Given
                          these issues, the appointment of Alegre as Yuga Labs’ CEO marks an interesting new phase for the
                          company. As Yuga Labs continues to expand its presence in the NFT gaming space, it will be
                          important for the company to navigate these complex issues with transparency and responsibility.

                          highest world-wide opening this year didn’t quite match expectations, the film’s ultimate success
                          will depend on its long term appeal, a notable attribute of many of Cameron’s movies. “Avatar: The
                          Way of Water” has so far earned $435 million at the global box office. 'Avatar: The Way of Water'
                          could be a 'life saver' for China's cinemas Though Cameron hasn’t revealed exactly how much it cost
                          to make the “Avatar” sequel, one answer isn’t in doubt: a lot. Or in Cameron’s own words to GQ
                          Magazine, “very f***ing expensive.” The star director estimated to industry executives that in
                          order to break even the movie has “to be the third or fourth highest-grossing film in history.”
                          That means it needs to make more than $2 billion. Earning nearly $3 billion, “Avatar” is the
                          highest-grossing film of all time. And only one film during the pandemic era, “Spider-Man: No Way
                          Home,” has even come close to that mark, raking in nearly $1.9 billion.

                          Some even said $175 or higher, but tracking has also not been as reliable a metric during the
                          pandemic. Disney saw early that “The Way of Water” was going to be a different kind of beast when
                          they looked at pre-sales. For a normal, spoiler-heavy movie like many Marvel offerings,
                          post-opening weekend sales are usually around 5%. For “The Way of Water,” they were at 20%. In
                          other words, the company knew that tracking was overinflated. “We’ve got a terrific movie that is
                          playing across all demographics and (has) terrific word of mouth,” said Tony Chambers, the Walt
                          Disney Co.’s executive vice president for theatrical distribution. “We’ve got the screens and we’ve
                          got a clear run. This isn’t about the opening day or the opening weekend. This is about the entire
                          run.” The film began its international rollout on Wednesday and debuted in North America on
                          Thursday evening. Domestically, “Avatar: The Way of Water” was released in 4,202 theaters on over
                          12,000 screens, 400 of which were IMAX 3D. The studio and filmmakers bet big on the draw, and
                          higher prices, of the 3D format and premium large screens. By the end of Friday, “Avatar: The Way
                          of Water” had already earned $53 million in the U.S. and Canada and $180.

                          Pinocchio" during the Oscars show at the 95th Academy Awards in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California,
                          U.S., March 12, 2023. REUTERS/Carlos Barria By Danielle Broadway LOS ANGELES, March 12 (Reuters) -
                          Mexican filmmaker Guillermo del Toro's "Pinocchio" won the Academy Award for best animated feature
                          film on Sunday, the third Oscar of his career. The haunting stop-motion musical fantasy was
                          inspired by the 1883 Italian novel "The Adventures of Pinocchio" by Carlo Collodi, and informed by
                          Gris Grimly's illustrations of the 2002 edition of the book. Del Toro, 58, reimagines the classic
                          story of Pinocchio, a wooden puppet who dreams of being a real boy, who is cared for by carver
                          Geppetto. However, the story of the Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) film is set in Fascist Italy during the
                          interwar period and World War Two. "Pinocchio" prevailed over other popular nominees A24's
                          stop-motion film "Marcel the Shell With Shoes On" and the Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) 3D animated film
                          "Turning Red." Del Toro has many accolades, including his 2018 Oscar wins for best picture and best
                          director for "The Shape of Water.

                          game, according to Tipico Sportsbook. The Bulldogs are -260 on the moneyline. The Buckeyes are
                          +210. The over/under for the game is set at 62 points. Bill Bender writes: "The Buckeyes are in a
                          rare underdog role, and that makes them dangerous against the Bulldogs. Georgia is 4-0 ATS when
                          favored by 20 points or less, and they are going to hit the Buckeyes with a rushing attack that
                          averaged 207 yards per game. Quarterback Stetson Bennett also hasn't been sacked in his last six
                          games. C.J. Stroud, however, will have success on the perimeter with Marvin Harrison Jr. and Emeka

                          which costs $3 per user per month billed annually and tops out at 10 GB of storage. To coincide
                          with the introduction of the new tier, Microsoft today announced the general availability of the
                          Microsoft 365 app, which replaces the Microsoft Office app with a new design and new features. As
                          previewed earlier this year during Microsoft’s Ignite conference, the Microsoft 365 app — now live
                          on the web — provides quick access to apps including Word, Excel and PowerPoint in addition to file
                          templates, “smart” recommendations, to-do list functionality and syncing across different devices.
                          The Microsoft 365 app will launch on Windows, Android and iOS later this month, Microsoft says.
                          Rounding out the raft of new apps and services, Microsoft 365 users will soon be able to view,
                          manage and upgrade cloud storage across devices via a new “simplified view,” says the company.
                          Starting February 1 from a Microsoft account, Windows settings or app settings, subscribers can
                          mange and upgrade their cloud file and photo storage. The investment in Microsoft 365 makes sense.
                          It is a growing revenue item for Microsoft, which has bet much of its future on the cloud and, by
                          extension, cloud-driven subscriptions. In its Q4 2022 earnings call, Microsoft reported that
                          Microsoft 365 Consumer subscribers grew 15% to 59.

                          It’s more of a shift in focus where we’re doubling down on Microsoft 365 as our productivity suite,
                          and we want people, when they think of productivity, to think about Microsoft 365 and not Office.”
                          Later this month will also mark 10 years since Microsoft first introduced consumer subscriptions
                          for Office. Known back then as Office 365 Home Premium, the plan included access to Office desktop
                          apps and 20GB of cloud storage. That’s been increased to 1TB of cloud storage these days, alongside
                          a bunch of features added to the subscription. “One thing hasn’t changed over the last 10 years:
                          the price,” writes Microsoft vice president Liat Ben-Zur in a blog post. “Microsoft 365 Personal
                          and Family still cost only $6.99 and $9.99 per month, respectively.” While inflation and costs have
                          been pushing up other subscription services over the past decade, Microsoft says it doesn’t have
                          any immediate plans to raise Microsoft 365 prices, but Oystryk doesn’t rule it out for the future.

                          Everything you need to know about Zack Snyder's new sci-fi movie franchise for Netflix. by Tigran
                          Asatryan Published on January 18th, 2023, 8:00 am EST Picture: Netflix Zack Snyder is teaming up
                          with Netflix to produce and direct two major sci-fi movies: Rebel Moon Part 1 and Part 2. The new
                          movie(s) is described as an epic sci-fi adventure compared with Star Wars in scope and scale.
                          Here’s an updated look at what we can expect from Rebel Moon which is now confirmed to arrive on
                          Netflix in December 2023. Zack Snyder will direct and co-write the film and will reunite with many
                          of his colleagues from past projects. The script for Rebel Moon will be co-written by Shay Hatten,
                          who co-wrote Army of the Dead, and Kurt Johnstad, who worked on 300 with Snyder. The Stone Quarry
                          is the main production company behind the movie with Grand Electric also listed, which is Eric
                          Newman’s production company that has an overall deal with Netflix. Snyder commented on the
                          inspiration for Rebel Moon in his THR interview: “This is me growing up as an Akira Kurosawa fan, a
                          Star Wars fan. It’s my love of sci-fi and a giant adventure.” @Netflix Let's go! https://t.

                          The decrease in residential fixed investment mainly reflected a decrease in new single-family
                          construction as well as brokers' commissions. The decrease in federal government spending reflected
                          decreases in both defense and nondefense spending. Within imports, both goods (led by nonautomotive
                          capital goods) and services (led by travel) increased. Current-dollar GDP increased 9.2 percent, or
                          $2.15 trillion, in 2022 to a level of $25.46 trillion, compared with an increase of 10.7 percent,
                          or $2.25 trillion, in 2021 (tables 1 and 3). The price index for gross domestic purchases increased
                          6.8 percent in 2022, compared with an increase of 4.2 percent in 2021 (table 4). The PCE price

                          prices, the PCE price index increased 5.0 percent, compared with an increase of 3.5 percent.
                          Measured from the fourth quarter of 2021 to the fourth quarter of 2022, real GDP increased 1.0

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prediction (only positive):
  - Answer              : Asher Angel
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          Related: Shazam! Big Screen History, Explained Billy Batson is played by Asher Angel while the
                          superhero adult form of Shazam is played by Zachary Levi. The character wears his comic book
                          character's signature red outfit with a white cape and lightning bolt on his chest. Shazam,
                          originally named Captain Marvel, was at one point the most popular superhero in the world and even
                          outsold Superman comics. The character has the potential to be a major part of the DCU; if the
                          sequel does well, there's little doubt he can fit him into James Gunn and Peter Safran's new plans
                          for the franchise. Freddy Freeman is Billy's physically disabled foster brother and also the first
                          person to learn that Billy has superpowers. Freddy is an expert on all things superheroes and helps
                          Billy learn more about his powers. Freddy Freeman's adult form, formerly known as Captain Marvel
                          Jr. in the comics, wears a blue super suit and has a great deal of flight power, which is fitting
                          because that was the superpower he told Billy he wished he could have. One of the most courageous
                          members of the group (representing Achilles), his kid form is played by Jack Dylan Grazer, while
                          his adult form is played by Adam Brody. A notable thing about Freddy Freeman is, while originally
                          under the name Captain Marvel Jr., was the favorite superhero of rock icon Elvis Presley.

                          Billy Batson, played by Asher Angel. You remember Billy, a constant runaway from the Philadelphia
                          foster homes he's been forced to endure since his teen mom deserted him. Billy's foster bestie is
                          Freddy (the scene-stealing Jack Dylan Grazer), a kid on crutches with a smart mouth on him. Things
                          have changed for Billy and his orphaned buds -- Mary (Grace Caroline Currey), Eugene (Ian Chen),
                          Pedro (Jovan Armand) and Darla (a fab Faithe Herman) -- ever since the Wizard (Djimon Hounsou)
                          picked him as his successor. "Put your hands on my staff," demanded the Wiz. "Gross!" said Billy,
                          in a response that typified the script's "Deadpool"-lite irreverence. I'm pleased to report that

                          Related: Shazam! Big Screen History, Explained Billy Batson is played by Asher Angel while the
                          superhero adult form of Shazam is played by Zachary Levi. The character wears his comic book
                          character's signature red outfit with a white cape and lightning bolt on his chest. Shazam,
                          originally named Captain Marvel, was at one point the most popular superhero in the world and even
                          outsold Superman comics. The character has the potential to be a major part of the DCU; if the
                          sequel does well, there's little doubt he can fit him into James Gunn and Peter Safran's new plans
                          for the franchise. Freddy Freeman is Billy's physically disabled foster brother and also the first
                          person to learn that Billy has superpowers. Freddy is an expert on all things superheroes and helps
                          Billy learn more about his powers. Freddy Freeman's adult form, formerly known as Captain Marvel
                          Jr. in the comics, wears a blue super suit and has a great deal of flight power, which is fitting
                          because that was the superpower he told Billy he wished he could have. One of the most courageous
                          members of the group (representing Achilles), his kid form is played by Jack Dylan Grazer, while
                          his adult form is played by Adam Brody. A notable thing about Freddy Freeman is, while originally
                          under the name Captain Marvel Jr., was the favorite superhero of rock icon Elvis Presley.

                          TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew will testify for his first congressional hearing on Thursday, where he is
                          likely to face intense grilling from politicians from both parties who argue that the popular app,
                          which has 150 million U.S. users, cannot be trusted. Here’s a quick guide for what to know about
                          Chew, a 40-year-old Singaporean who interned at Facebook and studied at Harvard Business School
                          before becoming the public face of one of the most popular — and contentious — apps in the United
                          States. TikTok's CEO testifies before Congress. Follow our live updates. Chew was born and raised
                          in Singapore, the island nation in Southeast Asia that has become a prominent bridge for
                          international business between China and the West. “The thing about growing up on a small island …
                          is you get wanderlust at a very young age,” he said in an interview last year. After completing his
                          military service — mandatory for most male Singaporeans — he left to study economics at University
                          College London (UCL), a top British university, graduating in 2006 and working at investment bank
                          Goldman Sachs for two years. He then moved to the United States to get his master’s degree at
                          Harvard Business School. “I remember struggling with this decision,” he said in a speech to UCL
                          graduates in 2022, as he was unsure whether taking time to do the master’s degree “would enhance or
                          delay my career.

                          by the popular video-sharing app and potential Chinese spying. Under his helm, TikTok reached 150
                          million users in the U.S., the majority of them teens and young adults who are attracted to the
                          app’s simple interface and addictive algorithm that serves up short videos on just about any
                          imaginable topic. Lawmakers have said they’re worried about American data falling into the hands of
                          the Chinese government and claim it threatens national security and user privacy and could be used
                          to promote pro-Beijing propaganda and misinformation. Chew attempted to persuade lawmakers not to
                          pursue a ban on the app or force Chinese parent company ByteDance to give up its ownership stake,
                          testifying that TikTok prioritizes the safety of young users. He says the company plans to store

                          their two children. He graduated in 2006 from University College London and worked for two years at

                          Another example is Jerry's girlfriend Vanessa, who appears in "The Stake Out" and with whom he ends
                          the relationship when things do not work out in "The Stock Tip". Other examples are Kramer getting
                          his jacket back and Elaine heading the "Peterman catalog". Larry David, the head writer and
                          executive producer for the first seven seasons, was praised for keeping a close eye on minor
                          details and making sure the main characters' lives remained consistent and believable. Curb Your
                          Enthusiasm, David's later comedy series, expanded on this idea by following a specific theme for
                          all but one season in the series. A major difference between Seinfeld and sitcoms that preceded it
                          is that the principal characters never learn from their mistakes. In effect, they are indifferent
                          and even callous toward the outside world and sometimes one another. A mantra of the show's
                          producers was "No hugging, no learning."[52] Entertainment Weekly's TV critic Ken Tucker has
                          described them as "a group dynamic rooted in jealousy, rage, insecurity, despair, hopelessness, and
                          a touching lack of faith in one's fellow human beings."[53] This leads to very few happy endings,
                          except at somebody else's expense. More often in every episode, situations resolve with characters
                          getting a justly deserved comeuppance. The show premiered as The Seinfeld Chronicles on July 5,
                          1989. After it aired, a pickup by NBC seemed unlikely and the show was offered to Fox, which
                          declined to pick it up.

                          This bill is about where that family feels that child will be best taught. This bill is not about
                          attacking teachers. The opponents of this bill will state that we’re attacking teachers over and

                          private school scholarships plan work? Here are the details Opponents in both chambers hammered
                          Republicans over the legislation, arguing it would harm public education while unfairly benefitting
                          private schools that lack accountability and can pick and choose which students they will accept.
                          “Spending public money with no accountability is reckless. Our public schools and students deserve
                          better,” said Sen. Molly Donahue, D-Cedar Rapids. “Until we are willing to provide adequate funding
                          for the vast majority of our public school students, we should not be creating a private, exclusive
                          school entitlement program with unknown costs and unlimited funding — a blank check.” The bill,
                          House File 68, would phase in over three years and eventually allow all Iowa families to use up to
                          $7,598 a year in an "education savings account" for private school tuition. If any money is left
                          over after tuition and fees, families could use the funds for specific educational expenses,
                          including textbooks, tutoring, standardized testing fees, online education programs and vocational
                          and life skills training. The $7,598 per private school student is the same amount of funding the
                          state provides to public school students and is expected to rise in future years.

                          CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa (KCRG) - The number of Iowans applying for an Educational Savings Account under
                          Iowa’s new school voucher program has surpassed projections, raising questions on the costs to
                          state taxpayers and local school districts. As of Friday, the Iowa Department of Education says it
                          has received 15,538 applications for an Educational Savings Account, or ESA, to provide state
                          funding for a student to attend a private K-12 school. A Legislative Services Agency analysis
                          projected 14,068 would enroll in the first year of the program. The application period runs through
                          June 30th, meaning the number of applications will likely continue to grow. If all of those
                          applications are approved, the taxpayer cost for the program would likely exceed the $107 million
                          dollars estimate for this coming school year. It would also likely mean a larger-than-expected loss
                          in funding to public schools due to students enrolling instead in a private institution. State
                          funding to public schools is based on enrollment, so fewer enrolled students would mean less
                          funding from the state. Governor Reynolds’ voucher program aimed to offset at least some of that by
                          giving districts $1,176 per student who lives in a district and enrolls in a private school. The
                          state declined to provide demographic data on the applications so far, citing the ongoing
                          application period. That means it’s unclear yet how many of the applications are from public school
                          students.

                          cut into Google’s huge internet search business. A chatbot can instantly produce answers in
                          complete sentences that don’t force people to scroll through a list of results, which is what a
                          search engine would offer. Google started Bard as a webpage on its own rather than a component of
                          its search engine, beginning a tricky dance of adopting new A.I. while preserving one of the tech
                          industry’s most profitable businesses. “It’s important that Google start to play in this space

                          is the work of an AI - Google's chatbot named LaMDA, to be precise, which made headlines in the
                          summer when a now ex-engineer claimed it was sentient. Since then, the tech giant has started
                          running a very limited trial to put it through its paces. Sky News got access to the test phase
                          this week, as Google personnel took to the stage in New York to provide an update on their own work
                          with the AI. The presentation included how they were exploring whether LaMDA could generate videos,
                          realistic speech, and even write fiction. Is this the future of comedy? The AI acts taking to the

                          cut into Google’s huge internet search business. A chatbot can instantly produce answers in

                          Rob Salkowitz, Forbes Contributor: What’s your role and title? David Holz, Midjourney. I'm the
                          founder and CEO. I usually just prefer being called the founder, though, because CEO sounds very
                          businessy, and we're not very businessy. We're an applied research lab that makes products. What is
                          Midjourney’s mission? We like to say we’re trying to expand the imaginative powers of the human
                          species. The goal is to make humans more imaginative, not make imaginative machines, which I think
                          is an important distinction. Can you give a brief history of the company to date? We started
                          working on the imagination part of our company about a year and a half ago. There were some
                          breakthroughs on diffusion models, people understanding clip, openAI, that sort of thing. Almost
                          everyone involved in this is San Francisco and we all realized this is going to get serious, that
                          it’s different from a lot of other stuff. What does Midjourney see as the benefit of this
                          text-to-image technology for business and society? I’m definitely more concerned about society than
                          business. We’re a consumer product, but maybe 30%-50% of our users right now are professionals. The

                          “Coming from the IA [intelligence augmentation] school of thought, I’ve always been more interested
                          in empowering people and trying to make people better.” Like many experts in AI who believe in
                          using machines to perform tasks that humans would consider intelligent or smart —and experts in IA,
                          who place humans at the center of the system and use technology to support and complement human
                          cognitive functions, Holz chose a path that would let him enjoy the best of both worlds. “Over the
                          years, I’ve realized that we can use AI to empower people and to make people better and those
                          people can make better AI — it’s like coming full circle and everyone wins,” he said. Leap Motion
                          transpired out of this ideology. The company developed an optical hand tracking module that
                          captures the movements of human hands using AI. “The goal wasn’t to replace a sign language person,
                          but it was to allow us to literally be embodied in virtual spaces inside of computers. And now,
                          with Midjourney, we are not trying to replace an artist but are giving them tools to explore new
                          mediums of thought and expand their imaginative powers,” Holz explained. In 2021, Holz started
                          Midjourney as an independent research lab. Around the same time, industry buzzwords like ‘diffusion
                          models’ and ‘contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP)’ were on everyone’s lips. Building on
                          these developments, the lab began offering its text-to-image service in 2022.

                          three years. Pinterest has more than 400 million monthly active users and has long placed its focus
                          on its advertising business. But in recent years, it has shifted to make e-commerce more of a
                          priority. Earlier this month, for example, the company announced it was acquiring The Yes, an

                          jumped more than 5% in after-hours trading. Bill Ready, who was previously in charge of Google's
                          commerce business, is taking over the helm, effective Wednesday. Prior to joining Google, Ready was
                          executive vice president and chief operating officer of PayPal. He'd been at Google fewer than
                          three years. Pinterest has more than 400 million monthly active users and has long placed its focus
                          on its advertising business. But in recent years, it has shifted to make e-commerce more of a
                          priority. Earlier this month, for example, the company announced it was acquiring The Yes, an

Question 253              : What is the release date for Pikmin 4 on Nintendo Switch?
Correct Answers         :

                          Pikmin 4 is so close to lanching on the Nintendo Switch, and here's when fans can expect to jump
                          into the digital version. Pikmin 4 is set to launch for the Nintendo Switch on July 21 and marks
                          the newest numbered entry in the real-time strategy series in over ten years, making its release
                          quite the big deal for hardcore fans. Instead of playing as Captain Olimar (who most people know
                          from Super Smash Bros. at this point) or any of his space explorer comrades, gamers will get to
                          customize their own character (a series first). There are not too many options available, but it's
                          still a step forward in terms of a character creator in a Nintendo first-party title. Pikmin 4
                          comes out in a couple of days and retails for $59.99, the same price as most other major games on
                          the Switch. People who decided to pre-order the game digitally via the Switch eShop are probably

                          of those who are being laid off - the 11,000 from last fall - were still on the payroll, the
                          company said.

                          The company’s headcount ballooned during the pandemic from 48,000 on March 31, 2020 to 87,000
                          before layoffs started in November. “We should prepare ourselves for the possibility that this new
                          economic reality will continue for many years.” During Meta’s last earnings call in February,
                          Zuckerberg declared this the “year of efficiency,” even as he continues to spend billions to build
                          out his vision of the metaverse. Since November’s layoffs, he has been focused on reducing layers
                          of management, telling employees in January, “I don’t think you want a management structure that’s
                          just managers managing managers, managing managers, managing managers, managing the people who are
                          doing the work.” In his memo announcing more layoffs, Zuckerberg said that it no longer makes sense
                          for managers to have only “a few” direct reports and confirmed that many of them will be asked to
                          become individual contributors throughout the company. “A leaner org will execute its highest
                          priorities faster,” he wrote. “People will be more productive, and their work will be more fun and
                          fulfilling.” He said Meta will continue canceling low-priority projects throughout the company and
                          that he had “underestimated the indirect costs” of running them. Just yesterday, Meta said it would
                          end work to facilitate the sharing of NFTs on Facebook and Instagram, and a standalone product
                          group for creating new social apps called New Product Experimentation was quietly canned last week.

Question 256              : Which team won Super Bowl LVII?
Correct Answers         :  
                          Kansas City Chiefs
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prediction (only positive):
  - Answer              : Cheffers
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          Here’s a breakdown of the playoff overtime rules: Carl Cheffers, an NFL official since 2000, will
                          be the referee for Super Bowl LVII. The Whittier native has refereed two Super Bowls, the first in
                          2017 when Tom Brady and the New England Patriots defeated the Atlanta Falcons in overtime of Super
                          Bowl LI. His last Super Bowl assignment was in 2021 when the Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers
                          defeated the Kansas City Chiefs. Cheffers, 62, and his crews ranked No. 1 in the league for
                          penalties called during the 2022 regular season, averaging 14.4 flags per game, according to
                          Profootballreference.com. During Super Bowl LV, Cheffers drew the ire of many Chiefs fans for eight
                          first-half penalties against Kansas City. The Chiefs lost 95 yards in the game because of penalties
                          — a Super Bowl record. Here’s who will make up the rest of Cheffers’ Super Bowl LVII officiating
                          crew: Roy Ellison (umpire), Jerod Phillips (down judge), Jeff Bergman (line judge), John Jenkins

                          ceremony.[36] Meanwhile, actress Glenn Close, who was originally scheduled as a presenter during
                          the gala, canceled her appearance due to a positive COVID-19 test.[37] When the nominations were
                          announced, nine of the ten films nominated for Best Picture had earned a combined gross of $1.57
                          billion at the American and Canadian box offices at the time. Top Gun: Maverick was the
                          highest-grossing film among the Best Picture nominees with $718.7 million in domestic box office
                          receipts.[38] Avatar: The Way of Water came in second with $598.4 million; this was followed by
                          Elvis ($151 million), Everything Everywhere All at Once ($70 million), The Fabelmans ($15 million),
                          The Banshees of Inisherin ($9 million), Tar ($5.6 million), Triangle of Sadness ($4.2 million), and

                          unavailable due to their distributor Netflix's policy of refusing to release such figures.[39]
                          Furthermore, by virtue of Avatar: The Way of Water and Top Gun: Maverick's Best Picture
                          nominations, it marked the first time since the 55th ceremony in 1983 that the two highest grossing

                          season as host. The panel of coaches for the season consists of Blake Shelton, who returned for his
                          twenty-third and final season as a coach; returning coach Kelly Clarkson, who returned for her
                          ninth season after a one-season hiatus; and debuting coaches Chance the Rapper and Niall Horan.[3]
                          Gina Miles was named as the winner of the season, with the closest margin to-date, on the season
                          finale that aired on May 23, 2023. Her victory marks Niall Horan's first win as a coach, with Horan

                          as the youngest coach to win a season. On October 11, 2022, NBC announced that the show would be

Question 269              : What is the name of Elon Musk's new AI company?

                          Elon Musk wants to “understand the true nature of the universe.” At least that’s what his new AI
                          company, xAI, said on its website as he announced its formation on Wednesday. Musk incorporated xAI
                          in Nevada in March this year and reportedly purchased “roughly 10,000 graphics processing
                          units”—hardware that is required to develop and run state-of-the-art AI systems. The company has
                          not said how it is financed but the Financial Times reported in April that Musk was discussing
                          getting funding from investors in SpaceX and Tesla, two companies he runs. The company has not
                          shared much detail about its intentions, but said on its website that its team would be joining a
                          Twitter Spaces call on July 14 to take questions. (Musk is the owner of Twitter.) The AI company
                          will work closely with Twitter, now called X Corp., and Tesla, as well as other companies “to make
                          progress towards our mission,” xAI said on its website. The team at xAI, led by Musk, includes
                          former employees of prominent AI companies OpenAI and DeepMind, as well as Microsoft and Tesla. Dan
                          Hendrycks, director of the Center for AI Safety, is listed as an adviser. The Center for AI Safety
                          has been highly vocal about safety concerns.

                          was dissolved as a company this week and was replaced by a new company Musk calls X. The move is
                          seen as an attempt to build a social media platform that also allows payments, turning it into “the
                          everything app,” akin to how apps like WeChat work in China. Twitter announced this week it was
                          partnering with eToro to allow users to be able to trade stocks and crypto. It should be pretty
                          clear by now that Musk’s call for a six-month pause was purely out of self interest in the AI arms
                          race, as I wrote at the time. ChatGPT has become a fascinating tool for people who want to
                          experiment with large language models (LLMs) that answer questions posed in natural language. But
                          there are still a lot of kinks to be worked out, as ChatGPT will often give confident answers, even
                          when it’s wrong. AI is largely a magic trick at this point, sometimes spouting nonsense that users
                          may not know enough about to fact-check. But it’s an interesting magic trick and it’s something
                          that will improved upon as more people in the world of tech become involved. Musk must know he’s
                          behind in the most exciting development on the web since social media went mainstream in the late
                          2000s. But the billionaire clearly doesn’t intend to stay behind for long.

Question 270              : Who won the Virginia Tech spring game 2023?

                          Filed under: It’s the middle of April, the big Hokie Hi weekend has passed, and the biggest of the
                          big campus celebration events was the Spring Football Game. There were lots of things to look at
                          and analyze but for now, here are some shots and comments from the game. GO HOKIES!!! The crowd was
                          easily over 20,000 people. Hokie Hi weekend featured Friday and Saturday celebrations with an
                          evening tribute to the fallen 32 from April 16th 2007. The morning on Saturday was the 3.2 mile Run
                          and Walk for Remembrance, and the crowd there was estimated to be 15,000 or so. The weather in
                          Blacksburg not only cooperated, it assisted by being comfortably warm, without being hot, and a
                          light breeze was blowing. It was a magnificent way to honor the fallen and celebrate their memories
                          as Hokies. The Maroon Squad Offense was obviously mostly #1s int he depth chart, with Grant Wells
                          starting at Maroon Squad QB. He’d remain there for the first half. We’ll talk about the various
                          observations in a coming article, but overall, he did well and seemed like he was much more
                          comfortable than he was last season. We’ll take that as a major plus, for now.

                          student success For all to mean all, it has to mean each. CCSSO supports states in encouraging
                          innovation, learning from other sectors, and applying new principles to transform the educational
                          landscape. As the national voice of every state education leader, we advocate for the development

                          classes ranging from intermediate algebra to Advanced Placement calculus for 11 years at Union High
                          School in Tulsa, Oklahoma. A proud immigrant of Swedish-Iranian descent, Peterson is passionate

                          background. Amid a difficult first year of high school teaching, she found “One Good Thing,” a
                          collaborative blog for teachers to track the good things happening in their classrooms. She credits
                          daily posting there to helping her recognize the beautiful and positive experiences occurring in
                          her classroom, which inspired her to stay in the profession. She has since contributed 1,400 posts
                          to the blog. As Oklahoma Teacher of the Year, she has visited teachers across the state to
                          highlight their important work through the Teachers of Oklahoma campaign.

                          [79] CNET has reported that the "Apple retail experience hurts Best Buy" and noted, "Buy a MacBook
                          at the Apple Store and it's hard to go back to the Best Buy Windows laptop buying experience". The
                          publication also wrote that "Apple salespeople are generally more knowledgeable, the products
                          themselves are generally higher quality, and the stores are more appealing, aesthetically and
                          practically."[80] In October 2009, reports surfaced that Steve Jobs and his retail team would help
                          "drastically overhaul" Disney Stores. His involvement was described by The New York Times as
                          "particularly notable", given his work on the "highly successful" Apple Stores and his election to
                          Disney's board of directors in 2006.[81][82] In August 2009, the London Evening Standard reported
                          that Apple's first store in the United Kingdom, at Regent Street, was the most profitable shop of
                          its size in London, with the highest sales per square foot, taking in £60 million a year, or £2,000
                          per square foot.[83] Many other electronics retailers from around the world such as Huawei,
                          Samsung, Xiaomi started to follow the designing trend of Apple Store.[citation needed] In May 2016,
                          Apple significantly redesigned its Union Square Apple Store in downtown San Francisco, adding large
                          glass doors for the entry, open spaces with touch-sensitive tables and shelves for product
                          displays, and rebranded rooms for the store.

Question 275              : What was Sundar Pichai's total compensation in 2022?
Correct Answers         :  
                          226 million
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prediction (only positive):
  - Answer              : $6.3 million
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          The pay package awarded to Alphabet Inc. Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai soared to $226
                          million in 2022, boosted by a triennial stock grant, making him one of the world’s highest-paid
                          corporate leaders. The stock award portion of his pay amounted to $218 million, according to a
                          filing from the Google parent company Friday. He received a total of $6.3 million in compensation
                          in 2021, when he didn’t receive the grant, and his salary has remained steady at $2 million the
                          past three years. The 50-year-old CEO has been navigating a more competitive industry, with AI
                          products such as the chatbot ChatGPT from startup OpenAI threatening to undermine Google’s
                          dominance in search. A broader tech slowdown also has taken a toll on the company, with its shares
                          sliding 39% in 2022. Still, they’ve mounted a comeback in 2023, rising 19%. Pichai’s stock award
                          comes on a three-year schedule, and he received a similarly sized package in 2019. That year, the

                          received $226M in total compensation in 2022, including a $218M equity award via a triennial stock
                          grant. Annual salary was $2M, with the CEO's compensation package also including almost $6M for
                          personal security. Difficult time? The news comes as Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL) initiates cost
                          restructuring measures, including layoffs of 12,000 workers, or 6% of workforce. Pichai even said
                          in January that top executives would get lower bonuses as part of cost-cutting measures. In
                          December, the company granted a new triannual equity award to Pichai with a value of $210M. In
                          2019, the last year his compensation included a triannual stock grant, his compensation was valued
                          at $281M. Have a tip? Submit confidentially to our News team. Found a factual error? Report here.

                          she herself is assaulted by one of her male colleagues. When Comer's character goes to court and

                          she wrote "Prima Facie" (a legal term that means self-evident) to highlight just how much the
                          British and American justice systems fail women who bring sexual assault cases. "The statistics
                          speak for themselves," Miller said. "One in 10 women actually reports a sexual assault. Out of
                          those, I think it's one in 10 that go to court. And out of those, there's a 1.3% conviction rate.

                          can become cumbersome and exhausting. That is what drove Dmitri Mirakyan, 28, a data scientist in
                          New York, to develop YourMove.ai, an AI dating tool that helps users begin and respond to messages.
                          “This past summer, I got really tired of sifting through and trying to come up with responses on
                          dating apps,” he said. “So I tried to see if GPT3 could flirt. It turns out it could. A month
                          later, I built the first version [of the platform] on a Saturday.” Unlike Rizz and a similar app
                          called Keys, Your Move does not yet plug into a user’s keyboard, and you must enter messages
                          manually and it will generate a response. However, Mirakyan says a keyboard update is coming soon.
                          Mirakyan said that he has always struggled with social interaction and reading social cues, and
                          that he built the app for those like him who need help making digital communication seamless.
                          “There’s such a gap currently in what people like myself want to communicate and how it comes
                          across,” he said. “Just trying to be honest or communicate a point [can mean] not reading the room
                          or stumbling over ourselves.” Users across the country are embracing the app’s ability to generate

                          comparison. Speaking to WaPo, he explained that he's always had a difficult time reading social
                          cues — a dating stressor that a tool like YourMove.ai helps to alleviate. "There's such a gap
                          currently," he told the newspaper, "in what people like myself want to communicate and how it comes
                          across." That's sympathetic, in a sense, and we could see how AI assistance might benefit folks who
                          have a tough time socially. At the same time, however, balance is definitely still needed here.
                          Romance is one of the most human things out there, and the digital dating world is robotic enough
                          as it is. Do we really want everyone on the apps just passing AI-generated quips and complements
                          back and forth for eternity? That's starting to sound like The Sims — and as humans, maybe we

                          57 Sporting director Earnie Stewart is leaving U.S. Soccer and will return to the Netherlands to
                          join Eredivisie club PSV Eindhoven, the federation announced Thursday. Additionally, U.S. men’s
                          national team general manager Brian McBride is moving on after three years in his role. Here’s what
                          you need to know: U.S. Soccer hired Stewart in 2018 as the USMNT’s first general manager, and he
                          led the hiring search that resulted in Berhalter becoming the national team’s coach. Once Stewart
                          was promoted to sporting director, he helped hire McBride to take over as GM. The departures of
                          Stewart and McBride leave the USMNT with a completely blank slate. The USMNT now has no head coach,
                          no general manager and no sporting director overseeing the program. That’s a daunting position, but
                          it also presents a huge opportunity for the federation ahead of the 2026 World Cup that the U.S.
                          will co-host with Canada and Mexico. Advertisement “I know this moment feels a bit uncertain,” USSF

                          best known as the voice of Alpha 5 in Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers. Perfectly cast as the cartoony
                          character Turgle in Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, Horvitz's zany performance gives levity to a game
                          that can be heavy and have a darker tone. Turgle can be found on the planet of Koboh and, without
                          giving too much away, players will end up feeling one way or another about Turgle in their

                          It’s currently on a hiatus and it’s also hard to say when the new season will come back to the NBC
                          as the premiere date hasn’t even yet been confirmed yet online. We’re hopeful that Grand Crew
                          season 2 is currently shooting and the premiere date will be sometime in early 2023. Its regular
                          time slot is 8:30 p.m. EST on Tuesdays. The show might have to compete with upcoming pilots who
                          might compete for its time slot. With that being said, hopefully there isn’t a drastic last-minute
                          change to the 2022-2023 lineup. Other shows to watch out for include American Auto, Young Rock,
                          Quantam Leap, La Brea, and New Amsterdam. And for those of you who haven’t met the crew yet, what
                          are you waiting for? This group of millennials will have you laughing all night long. Check out the
                          trailer and see for yourself below: Grand Crew is currently available to stream on Peacock. Stay

                          It marked the largest bank failure since the 2008 financial crisis. "As we look at the overall US
                          banking system, this is a strong [system], this is a safe [system], this is the envy of the world,"
                          Citi CEO Jane Fraser said on Yahoo Finance Live. Despite the banking turmoil, the S&P 500 is down
                          less than 1% in the past month. It's up roughly 6% on the year. But the negatives for markets are
                          becoming too hard to ignore for Koch and the other realists that Yahoo Finance chatted up at the
                          Milken Conference. Koch believes the economy is headed into a credit crunch, in part fueled by the
                          rolling banking crisis that continues to unfold. As that lending plays out, Koch thinks it could
                          begin to weigh on the commercial real estate market. "[Regional banks] have this dual pressure from
                          both deposit outflow and their commercial real estate exposure, and that's going to put pressure on
                          those banks," she explained. "It's going to put pressure on their ability to extend credit, which
                          in turn is going to put pressure on the economy and jobs. We are quite worried about that, and that
                          really underscores the base view as to why we're in the more bearish camp." Brian Sozzi is Yahoo

                          his contract expires at the end of 2022. In August 2021, sources said he was expected to leave when
                          the impending departure of Tad Rivelle, CIO of fixed income, was announced. Mr. Lippman has been
                          CEO of TCW Group since 2012. A TCW Group spokesman said in an email that Ms. Koch was selected for
                          "her broad experience in domestic and international business development and strategic planning."
                          GSAM announced Ms. Koch's departure in a statement on Tuesday emailed by a spokeswoman. She will
                          not be directly replaced, and the heads of the three primary investment platforms within public

                          For charging, the Pixel Fold supports 21W wired speeds. However, you’ll have to purchase Google’s
                          30W power adapter ($25 at Google Store) separately. The phone also supports wireless charging at up
                          to 7.5W and will work with any Qi wireless charger. No. Furthermore, the Google Pixel does not
                          support pen/stylus input. The Pixel Fold’s inner display is protected by Ultra Thin Glass, complete
                          with a protective plastic layer applied. Gorilla Glass Victus protects the external display. Yes.
                          The Google Pixel Fold has an IPX8 certification, which means it can be submerged in up to 1.5
                          meters of freshwater for up to 30 minutes. No, Google no longer includes chargers with its
                          smartphones. You’ll have to buy a compatible charger that supports USB Power Delivery PPS. The
                          Google Pixel Fold supports dual SIMs. One is a nano-SIM slot, and the second is via eSIM. The Pixel
                          Fold was announced on May 10, 2023. General availability of the phone will commence in June 2023.
                          Folding phones are great for those who want a large-screen device but don’t want the size penalty
                          of carrying a tablet. Based on our hands-on experience, the Pixel Fold should also be a great
                          traditional handset when folded. There’s no indication that Google is working on a second, smaller
                          flip phone to partner the Pixel Fold or challenge the Galaxy Z Flip series.

                          budget-friendly Pixel 7a, Google’s first folding handset is finally here. The highly-anticipated
                          Pixel Fold will compete for your attention in a quickly crowding foldable phones market of which
                          Samsung is currently king. Here’s everything you need to know about the Google Pixel Fold. Google
                          officially unveiled the Pixel Fold at Google I/O on March 10, 2023. It comes in two colors —
                          Obsidian and Porcelain. You can also choose between three official Pixel Fold cases that come in
                          Hazel, Porcelain, and Bay colors (pictured above). Google is charging a similar price to the rival
                          Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4. The 256GB variant of the Pixel Fold will cost you a whopping $1,799. The
                          512GB version is even more expensive at $1,919, which seems costly for Google’s first attempt at a
                          foldable phone. Google hopes you buy the foldable Pixel for its thin form factor, “true pocket
                          size,” loaded camera features, “all-day battery,” multi-tasking skills, and long-lasting software
                          support. However, we’ll only know if it justifies that price when we review the device. As for
                          availability, Google is not casting a very wide net for the Pixel Fold. The handset will only sell
                          in the US, UK, Germany, and Japan, at least to start with.

                          May 11, 2023, marks the end of the federal COVID-19 PHE declaration. After this date, CDC’s
                          authorizations to collect certain types of public health data will expire. The United States has
                          mobilized and sustained a historic response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a nation, we now find
                          ourselves at a different point in the pandemic – with more tools and resources than ever before to
                          better protect ourselves and our communities. CDC has been working for many months to fold the
                          agency’s COVID-19 emergency response activities into its existing structure and programs, as part
                          of an ongoing transition to sustainable public health practice. The agency has also been working
                          with partners, including states and local territories, to prepare for the end of the PHE
                          declaration and communicate updated reporting requirements and cadences. While reporting frequency
                          and source data for some metrics will shift when the PHE declaration ends, CDC will continue to
                          report valuable data to inform individual and community public health actions to protect those at
                          highest risk of severe COVID-19. Our priority remains providing the information necessary to
                          protect the nation’s public health. Most tools, like vaccines, treatments, and testing, will remain
                          available. But, some tools, like certain data sources and reporting, will change. Access to
                          COVID-19 vaccines will generally not be affected for now. The U.S. government is currently
                          distributing free COVID-19 vaccines for all adults and children.

                          vaccination are set to end on October 1, 2024. These rules allowed, for example, pharmacy interns,
                          healthcare providers with recently expired licenses and those licensed to work only in one state to
                          give COVID-19 vaccines. There is ongoing deliberation at the federal level and in the courts in
                          this area. For more information on Healthcare Provider Flexibilities, visit the Public Health

                          with partners, including states and local territories, to prepare for the end of the PHE
                          declaration and communicate updated reporting requirements and cadences. While reporting frequency
                          and source data for some metrics will shift when the PHE declaration ends, CDC will continue to
                          report valuable data to inform individual and community public health actions to protect those at
                          highest risk of severe COVID-19. Our priority remains providing the information necessary to
                          protect the nation’s public health. Most tools, like vaccines, treatments, and testing, will remain
                          available. But, some tools, like certain data sources and reporting, will change. Access to
                          COVID-19 vaccines will generally not be affected for now. The U.S. government is currently
                          distributing free COVID-19 vaccines for all adults and children.

                          by GPT-4 from OpenAI, will sit alongside Microsoft 365 apps much like an assistant (remember
                          Clippy?), appearing in the sidebar as a chatbot that allows Office users to summon it to generate
                          text in documents, create PowerPoint presentations based on Word documents, or even help use
                          features like PivotTables in Excel. Microsoft’s Copilot leaked earlier today. “It works alongside
                          you, embedded in the apps millions of people use everyday: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams,
                          and more,” said Microsoft 365 head Jared Spataro. “Copilot is a whole new way of working.”
                          Microsoft 365 users will be able to summon Copilot to provide information on an upcoming Microsoft
                          Teams meeting, preparing people with updates on related projects, organizational changes like
                          recent hires, and even updates on co-workers who might have returned from vacation. Copilot can
                          also be summoned throughout Microsoft’s Office apps and be used in Word to draft documents based on
                          other files. The AI-generated text can then be freely edited and adapted.

  - Source              :
                          According to Alan Cooper, the "Father of Visual Basic", the concept of Clippit was based on a
                          "tragic misunderstanding" of research conducted at Stanford University, showing that the same part
                          of the brain in use while using a mouse or keyboard was also responsible for emotional reactions
                          while interacting with other human beings and thus is the reason people yell at their computer
                          monitors.[11] Microsoft concluded that if humans reacted to computers the same way they react to
                          other humans, it would be beneficial to include a human-like face in their software.[11] As people
                          already related to computers directly as they do with humans, the added human-like face emerged as
                          an annoying interloper distracting the user from the primary conversation.[11] First introduced in
                          Microsoft Office 97,[12] the Office Assistant was codenamed TFC during development.[13] It appeared
                          when the program determined the user could be assisted by using Office wizards, searching help, or
                          advising users on using Office features more effectively. It also presented tips and keyboard
                          shortcuts. For example, typing an address followed by "Dear" would cause the Assistant to appear
                          with the message, "It looks like you're writing a letter. Would you like help?" Microsoft turned
                          off the feature by default in Office XP.[14] The feature was removed altogether in Office 2007 and
                          Office 2008 for Mac.

                          Subscribe for regular MacRumors news and future Apple Vision Pro info. Apple Vision Pro is Apple's
                          augmented and virtual reality headset, a device that has been in development for more than a
                          decade. Vision Pro marks the company's first entrance into a new product category since the 2015
                          Apple Watch, with the device introduced at WWDC 2023 in June. A launch is set for early 2024, which
                          means January to late April. While the Apple Vision Pro is definitely a headset, Apple does not use
                          that word when referring to it. Instead, Apple calls it a spatial computer because of its ability
                          to blend digital content with the physical world. Apple Vision Pro is a mixed reality headset that
                          displays augmented reality content overlaid on world around you, and immersive entirely virtual
                          content, but it's worth noting that the headset is not see through. Everything you see is digital.
                          For augmented reality content that does not make your surroundings disappear, Apple uses cameras
                          that map out what's in front of you, translating that into a digital image augmented by virtual
                          elements. For a virtual reality experience, Apple shuts off those cameras and can make it seem like
                          you are completely isolated from what's going on around you, allowing you to focus solely on what's
                          being displayed on the headset's screens. This shift between the "real" and the "immersive" can be
                          controlled with an on-device Digital Crown.

  - Source              :
                          Apple did not respond to our request for comment. The headset is believed to be the same size as
                          Meta’s Oculus Quest and focused on high-tech and high-performance. Additionally, it’s said to
                          include an even more power-hungry processor than the M1 found on the MacBook Air and 13-inch
                          MacBook Pro. VR is the headset’s primary focus, but it will also offer some AR functionality, per
                          Bloomberg’s initial look at the product. Can Apple keep the AR industry alive? The new product will
                          find Apple competing directly against Meta’s Quest Pro (rumored for a release next month), and
                          PlayStation VR. According to the filing, Apple’s headset could offer both gaming and FaceTime
                          functionality, along with health and educational features. While Meta’s devices have been used for
                          some medical training, they weren’t designed with such use cases in mind. Apple is holding a big
                          event at its Cupertino HQ next week, with the iPhone 14 and Apple Watch Series 8 serving as
                          headliners. A sneak peek of the new headset could also be on the agenda, as the company looks to
                          entice developers to create content for the new category. Executives are believed to have already
                          shown off a version of the product to shareholders.

                          own script in mind in the U.S. Open. In front of him was Rory McIlroy, one of golf’s biggest
                          talents who looked ready to end his perplexing nine-year drought in the majors. Next to him in the
                          final group Sunday was Rickie Fowler, a Southern California native who returned from a three-year
                          slump and was poised to finally win his first major. Clark carried a message from his late mother —
                          “Play big,” she always told him — and the belief he could compete with anyone on any stage. No
                          stage was bigger than a U.S. Open on the edge of Beverly Hills. That’s where Clark delivered clutch

                          a major champion. “I feel like I belong on this stage,” Clark said after closing with an even-par
                          70 for a one-shot victory over McIlroy. “Even two, three years ago when people didn’t know who I
                          was, I felt like I could still play and compete against the best players in the world.

                          the 17th. Now with a one-shot lead playing the 18th, Clark two-putted from 60 feet to win the
                          tournament.[25] Rory McIlroy began the round a shot off the lead and opened with a birdie on the
                          first hole to tie for the lead. This was his last birdie—he did not make another the rest of the
                          round, and bogeyed the 14th after hitting his third shot into the ridge of a bunker and taking a
                          drop for an embedded lie. He finished with 70 to end up at nine-under, a shot back of Clark.[26]
                          Fowler, tied with Clark at the start of the round, made three bogeys over his first seven holes and
                          did not make a birdie until the eighth, his first since the 13th hole in the third round. His
                          birdie on the 14th was his 23rd of the tournament, establishing a new U.S. Open record. He shot a
                          five-over 75 to fall back into a tie for fifth place with Tommy Fleetwood and Min Woo Lee.[27]
                          Fleetwood, who began the round in 38th place, made two eagles and was eight-under through 14 holes
                          before a bogey at the 16th.

                          In 2022, Amazon held a second Prime Day event dubbed Prime Early Access Sale. Amazon said Prime
                          members ordered more than 100 million items from merchants during the Early Access sale. Prime Day,
                          which features deals on many products on Amazon.com, began in 2015 as a celebration of Amazon’s
                          20th year in business. It turned into a summer sales holiday designed to drum up additional
                          business for Amazon — and the retailer’s marketplace sellers — before the holiday shopping season.
                          In recent years, other large retailers have offered promotions on their own websites around Prime
                          Day to take advantage of the additional online shoppers. Amazon Prime Day takes place in more than
                          20 countries, including: Digital Commerce 360 estimates Amazon’s sales on Prime Day hit $12.09
                          billion globally during the manufactured retail holiday, which spanned July 12 and 13. That’s up
                          8.1% year over year from the same shopping spree in 2021, which ran from June 21 through 22. In
                          2021, Prime Day sales reached $11.19 billion and represented a 7.7% increase over Amazon’s 2020
                          event. Prime Day 2021 fell less than a year after the 2020 sales event, which contributed to the
                          slowdown in growth from 45.1% earlier in the pandemic. Amazon postponed Prime Day 2020, pushing it
                          from its usual summer time slot to mid-October because of the coronavirus pandemic.

Question 300              : Who was the MVP of Super Bowl 2022?

                          Where does Rams receiver's historic season rank in NFL history Kupp was also instrumental in the
                          Rams' final go-ahead drive: He converted fourth-and-1 at the Rams' 37 with a 7-yard end-around and
                          also caught three passes for 38 yards prior to his game-winning catch. That doesn't include a
                          4-yard touchdown in the back of the end zone that was nullified by offsetting penalties (holding on
                          the Rams and unnecessary roughness on the Bengals). "I don’t feel deserving of this … I don’t know

                          pic.twitter.com/PfvXv0S1te Indeed, Kupp helped create two drive-extending penalties in the game's
                          fateful moments: defensive holding on Logan Wilson on third-and-goal from the Bengals' 8 and
                          defensive pass interference on cornerback Eli Apple two plays later. Donald was similarly impactful
                          on the defensive side of the ball, registering four tackles (two for loss), two sacks and three
                          quarterback hits — including the one that forced an incompletion by Joe Burrow on fourth-and-1,
                          sealing the victory for Los Angeles.
