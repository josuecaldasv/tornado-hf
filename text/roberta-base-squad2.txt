                          Kinglsey family who underwrites the funding for the hospital. As the hospital's new head of
                          finance, he also serves as a love interest for Sam, who is just getting over a previous
                          relationship. Sam's team of doctors (Skye P. Marshall, Omar Maskati, Davi Santos, Michael

                          her best friend hiding a huge secret. Overall, Good Sam riffs on what CBS is known for --
                          comforting problem-of-the-week dramas -- and adds a new level of spice and interest to the
                          proceedings. Fans of the genre will undoubtedly want to go on the ride Good Sam has in store for

                          At some point, he and Batt may talk about the possibility of Key taking over the program, but Key
                          understands Batt’s job right now is to vet coaches and Key’s job is to try to put the best possible
                          product on the field to state his case. Even if Batt chooses to hire from outside, a great run as
                          the interim could vault Key into contention for other head coaching jobs. Key also wants to make
                          sure his players don’t believe winning is easy after doing it twice in a row. Though he doesn’t
                          mind letting them enjoy the new vibe on campus. “It’s been a while since we had this kind of
                          momentum in the program,” tight end Dylan Leonard told reporters Monday. “It’s our first time with
                          back-to-back wins. It’s great for us as players, but it’s also cool to see the fan base. You hear
                          different conversations in the classroom. There’s a little more hype. It’s really cool walking
                          around campus seeing people be excited about us.” Advertisement Semore worked as an analyst at
                          Georgia Tech in 2019 and 2020 before going to Valdosta State last season to be the defensive
                          coordinator. At the Division II powerhouse, Semore saw a team with a different attitude. The
                          Blazers walk onto the field every week expecting to win. When Semore returned to Georgia Tech this
                          season as the linebackers coach, the Yellow Jackets didn’t feel that way. But after consecutive
                          wins, they are starting to develop that feeling.

                          opposite DB Coach Travares Tillman, who serves as the team’s Defensive Pass Game Coordinator.

                          Tesla sold and delivered the majority of its vehicles in China in 2021. Of these electric cars,
                          478,078 were made in Tesla’s production facility, Gigafactory Shanghai. From its American
                          facilities, Gigafactory Texas and Gigafactory California, Tesla sold 301,998 vehicles. The company
                          is gaining popularity in Europe. In 2021, it sold 169,507 vehicles in European countries, where the
                          Tesla Model 3 was named Europe’s favorite electric vehicle. In 2019, the Netherlands bought the
                          largest number of Tesla cars among European countries – 30,911 vehicles. Norway and Germany
                          followed the Netherlands’ example with 18,798 and 10,711 cars purchased respectively. In Europe,
                          the annual sales of Tesla have been showing the following upward trajectory since 2012: In the
                          United States, Tesla was the first manufacturer to reach 200,000 cumulative sales of electric
                          vehicles, arriving at the end of its government subsidy cap of $,5000 per sold car. In other words,
                          since January 2020, no Tesla vehicle sold in the USA has received any subsidy. The annual sales of
                          Tesla vehicles in the US were as follows: Tesla started the production of its vehicles in China in
                          2018. In January 2020, Tesla’s Chinese Gigafactory started the output of the Tesla Model 3 Sedan
                          and batteries. The production of the Tesla Model Y began on the Chinese mainland in 2021.

                          Advertisement Supported by The electric-car maker managed substantial growth as Europe and China
                          increasingly propelled sales. By Neal E. Boudette Tesla reported Sunday that it delivered 936,000
                          cars in 2021, an 87 percent increase from the year before, despite the computer chip shortage that
                          has disrupted auto production around the world. In the fourth quarter alone, the company delivered
                          more than 308,000 vehicles, a 71 percent increase from the quarter a year earlier. The overwhelming
                          share of the deliveries were of the Model 3 sedan and the Model Y hatchback. Wall Street analysts
                          had been expecting deliveries of about 266,000 cars in the fourth quarter, and about 855,000 for
                          the year. “The numbers are hard to poke holes in,” Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities,
                          wrote in a note to investors. “While there are many competitors in the E.V. space, Tesla continues
                          to dominate market share as evidenced again this quarter.” Tesla increased sales despite a global
                          shortage of computer chips, which serve as the brains for a variety of electronics, including
                          engine controllers and touch screens. The shortage forced most automakers to idle some plants for
                          weeks at a time and kept them from producing as many vehicles as they had planned. In July, Tesla’s
                          chief executive, Elon Musk, said his company was overcoming the shortage by switching to types of
                          chips that were more readily available and writing new instructions, or firmware, to be embedded
                          into the chip.

                          founder and CEO Bryan Sheffield. The combined operation is comprised of 16 venues boasting 148

                          Wyoming. EVO will continue expanding in 2022 with additional locations currently under
                          construction. “Today is a monumental moment for our company and our industry,” said Mitch Roberts,

                          Super Bowl LVI[12] was an American football game played to determine the champion of the National

                          Angeles Rams defeated the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Cincinnati Bengals, 23–20.
                          The game was played on February 13, 2022, at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, the home
                          stadium of the Rams, marking the second consecutive and second overall Super Bowl with a team
                          playing and winning in its home stadium.[13][14][15][16] The Rams' victory was their second, first
                          as a Los Angeles-based team, and first since winning 1999's Super Bowl XXXIV when they were based
                          in St. Louis. Finishing with a 12–5 record, the Rams reached their fifth appearance after acquiring
                          veteran quarterback Matthew Stafford, who had not won a playoff game in his previous 12 years with
                          the Detroit Lions. The Bengals, who finished with a 10–7 record, were seeking their first Super
                          Bowl title following several decades of losing seasons and playoff struggles. They won their first
                          playoff game since 1990, ending the longest drought in the four major North American sports, en
                          route to their third Super Bowl appearance and first since 1988's Super Bowl XXIII.

                          televised exclusively by NBC—the NFL announced on March 13, 2019, that NBC had agreed to swap
                          2021's Super Bowl LV to CBS in exchange for Super Bowl LVI. Such a swap out of the normal rotation
                          was done before when CBS was given Super Bowl XXVI in January 1992 after it acquired the rights to
                          the 1992 Winter Olympics (which started 13 days later), and NBC then aired Super Bowl XXVII and
                          Super Bowl XXVIII in the next two consecutive years. NBC also aired Super Bowl LII in February
                          2018, under the normal Super Bowl cycle, a few days before it began its coverage of the 2018 Winter
                          Olympics. In all the other previous Winter Olympics years, the league stuck to the normal broadcast
                          cycle regardless of which network was broadcasting the Olympics. However, Super Bowl LVI was the
                          first Super Bowl to actually occur when the Winter Olympics were already underway: primetime
                          coverage of the Olympics would have had to compete with the Super Bowl—diluting viewership and
                          advertising revenue for CBS and NBC,[117][118] and there is an unsaid gentleman's agreement between
                          the NFL's broadcasters to not air competing original programming against the Super Bowl.

                          On February 21, 2022, Truth Social was released on Apple iOS,[98] reaching number one on the App
                          Store's top charts.[99][100] Due to an extensive backlog of applicants, upon downloading the app,
                          about 500,000 people who initially attempted to register as users were automatically
                          waitlisted.[101][102][103] The app was installed 872,000 times during its first week, but a month
                          later, new user signup had fallen to 60,000 per week. During that time, weekly visits to
                          truthsocial.com fell from 6 million to fewer than 2 million.[104] Upon its launch, the British
                          automotive solar power company Trailar complained Truth Social's app logo closely resembled its "T"
                          logo.[105] The platform has been criticized for its poor performance at launch, with waitlisting
                          users attempting to register and extended outages.[106] A day after its launch, The Washington Post
                          described it as "a disaster".[101] A week after, Newsweek reported some early adopters were
                          beginning to lose interest in the app due to low numbers of users and poor engagement, although
                          others were willing to persevere with the app to see if things would improve.[107] The Truth Social
                          platform suffered from severe and persistent problems with scalability at launch, limiting the
                          platform's growth.[108][109]

                          Reports say that Trump has been privately complaining that Google was trying to "fuck" him.
                          According to Rolling Stones' source, however, the truth is that Truth Social hasn't even submitted
                          an Android app to the Google Play store yet. Still, though, the launch of a web app is significant.
                          Truth Social profiles and posts will now be completely shareable on other platforms. Using the
                          iPhone app, if you want to share a Truth Social post on another platform, you have to take a
                          screenshot. Now, Truth Social users will be able to post links directly to any account or post. In
                          turn, non-Truth Social users will have direct access to sign up and engage with content on the
                          site. (Note: Internal Truth Social links currently require users to login to their account in order
                          to see the content.) In short: It's going to be a lot easier for Trump's fanbase to share his
                          content on other platforms. Launched in February, Truth Social struggled during the first few
                          months. Downloads plummeted after the initial rush to download due to a long waitlist of users
                          wanting to sign up. However, in recent weeks, Trump finally started posting on his own platform,
                          which has helped give the conservative social network another bounce. Truth Social announced a
                          public beta of the web app just last week. According to a press release from Wednesday, the initial
                          web app rollout was scheduled for some time over the next week or two.

                          logo.[105] The platform has been criticized for its poor performance at launch, with waitlisting
                          users attempting to register and extended outages.[106] A day after its launch, The Washington Post
                          described it as "a disaster".[101] A week after, Newsweek reported some early adopters were
                          beginning to lose interest in the app due to low numbers of users and poor engagement, although
                          others were willing to persevere with the app to see if things would improve.[107] The Truth Social
                          platform suffered from severe and persistent problems with scalability at launch, limiting the
                          platform's growth.[108][109]

                          Press Association announced the winners for the 79th Annual Golden Globe Awards tonight with The
                          Power of the Dog named Best Motion Picture – Drama and West Side Story as Best Motion Picture –
                          Musical or Comedy. On the television side, Succession won Best Television Series – Drama, while
                          Hacks won for Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy. After a year of controversy about
                          diversity, payola, and improper behavior endemic to the organization that culminated in the Globes
                          losing its NBC broadcast, tonight’s coverage and the subsequent congratulatory marketing from
                          winners will be a good litmus test for if the beleaguered organization can rinse off some of the
                          stink from a year of bad headlines and even more puzzling decisions. If you need a refresher on the

                          On Tuesday night, the Golden Globes were held for the 80th time in history, though this year's
                          ceremony was notable for a bigger reason. The awards show that is supposed to honor excellence in
                          film and TV has been trying to recover from a racial exclusion scandal after a 2021 Los Angeles
                          Times story revealed that none of the 87 Hollywood Foreign Press members was Black. Tom Cruise
                          subsequently gave back his Globes, NBC opted not to air the ceremony last year, and reform in the
                          form of inclusivity began to take shape. After Jerrod Carmichael explained to the audience at the
                          Beverly Hilton how he wound up as the host (spoiler: "I'm here because I'm Black," he quipped
                          before launching into a detailed and honest account of his decision-making process), the trophy
                          distribution began. The Banshees of Inisherin, which led all movies with eight nominations, struck
                          up a meaningful friendship with Globes voters over the evening: The Irish-island-set tragicomedy
                          took home the best comedy film trophy, while Colin Farrell triumphed in the acting category and
                          writer-director Martin McDonagh won for best screenplay. The Fablemans also came into frame by
                          winning best drama film honors and best director (Steven Spielberg). Meanwhile, Everything
                          Everywhere All at Once prevailed in two dimensions, as Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan netted acting
                          trophies.

                          Sony, the U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority first decided to block the acquisition, then

                          price of a Super Bowl commercial in 2022 hit a new peak as multiple companies paid $7 million for a
                          30-second spot. The Super Bowl regularly ranks as the most-watched event in the United States
                          year-to-year, which means the channel hosting the contest gets to charge a premium for advertising.
                          And if this year’s host was worried that businesses still suffered lingering effects from pandemic
                          lockdowns and a shrinking economy, those worries have evaporated: NBC sold out all of its Super
                          Bowl ad spots across all platforms – NBC, Telemundo and digital platforms including Peacock. Only a
                          handful of pre-game slots remain open, the company announced in a press release Thursday.

                          Seahawks.com Writer The great week for Seahawks wide receiver Tyler Lockett continues. Just days
                          after learning his feature on Black Wall Street had won an Emmy Award, Lockett was honored again on
                          Thursday night as the 2022 Seattle Male Sports Star of The Year. The live awards show has been a
                          tradition in Emerald City dating back to 1936. Created by the Seattle Post-Intelligencer and
                          renowned sports editor Royal Brougham, the show has honored some of the biggest names to play
                          professional sports in the city. Since arriving in Seattle from Kansas State in 2015, Lockett has
                          developed into a reliable and incredibly productive receiver in the Seahawks offense, and 2021 was
                          arguably his best season yet, setting a career high with 1,175 receiving yards, his
                          third-consecutive 1,000-yard season. The successes have continued off the field. Lockett received
                          the 2021 Steve Largent Award, given annually to the team contributor who best exemplifies the
                          spirit, dedication, and integrity of the Seahawks. He was also the Seahawks nominee for the NFL's
                          Walter Payton Man of the Year Award, recognizing a player for their excellence on and off the
                          field. And if that wasn't enough, Lockett passed his real estate licensing exam earlier this
                          offseason, selling his first home in April.

  - Source              :
                          12] In January 2022, The Verge reported that Google was building an AR headset which used
                          "outward-facing cameras to blend computer graphics with a video feed of the real world", internally
                          codenamed Project Iris and being developed in a highly secretive and secure facility located in the
                          San Francisco Bay Area. Overseen by Bavor, the headset was to be powered by the Android operating
                          system as well as a custom system on a chip akin to Tensor, expected to launch in 2024 alongside
                          Project Starline. Other key people named as part of the project include Shahram Izadi, Eddie Chung,
                          Scott Huffman, Kurt Akeley, and Lucovsky.[13] An early prototype of the headset bore a close
                          resemblance to the North Focals.[14] In March, The Information reported that Google would acquire
                          Raxium, an AR hardware startup, for approximately $1 billion, and would continue to make further
                          acquisitions to assist in their AR and mixed reality (MR) work.[15] The acquisition was completed a
                          month later.[16] In May 2022, Google unveiled a different version of Iris resembling eyeglasses
                          with live translation capabilities during the 2022 Google I/O keynote.[14][17][18] The company
                          began publicly testing these prototypes across the U.S. in August,[19] before expanding into Canada
                          in October.[20] According to Business Insider, Google executives' constantly changing strategy for
                          Project Iris frustrated employees.

                          12] In January 2022, The Verge reported that Google was building an AR headset which used
                          "outward-facing cameras to blend computer graphics with a video feed of the real world", internally
                          codenamed Project Iris and being developed in a highly secretive and secure facility located in the
                          San Francisco Bay Area. Overseen by Bavor, the headset was to be powered by the Android operating
                          system as well as a custom system on a chip akin to Tensor, expected to launch in 2024 alongside
                          Project Starline. Other key people named as part of the project include Shahram Izadi, Eddie Chung,
                          Scott Huffman, Kurt Akeley, and Lucovsky.[13] An early prototype of the headset bore a close
                          resemblance to the North Focals.[14] In March, The Information reported that Google would acquire
                          Raxium, an AR hardware startup, for approximately $1 billion, and would continue to make further
                          acquisitions to assist in their AR and mixed reality (MR) work.[15] The acquisition was completed a
                          month later.[16] In May 2022, Google unveiled a different version of Iris resembling eyeglasses
                          with live translation capabilities during the 2022 Google I/O keynote.[14][17][18] The company
                          began publicly testing these prototypes across the U.S. in August,[19] before expanding into Canada
                          in October.[20] According to Business Insider, Google executives' constantly changing strategy for
                          Project Iris frustrated employees.

                          Board New York — College Board announced today that the SAT® Suite of Assessments will be delivered
                          digitally. In November 2021, College Board piloted the digital SAT in the U.S. and internationally;
                          80% of students responded that they found it to be less stressful and 100% of educators reported
                          having a positive experience. While the transition to digital will bring a number of student- and
                          educator-friendly changes, many important features of the SAT Suite (SAT, PSAT/NMSQT®, PSAT™ 10,
                          PSAT™ 8/9) will stay the same. The SAT Suite will continue to measure the knowledge and skills that
                          students are learning in high school and that matter most for college and career readiness. The SAT
                          will still be scored on a 1600 scale, and educators and students can continue to track growth
                          across the SAT Suite of Assessments over time. The assessments will continue to be administered in
                          a school or in a test center with a proctor present—not at home. Students will still have access to
                          free practice resources on Khan Academy. And students taking the SAT Suite will continue to connect
                          to scholarships and the College Board National Recognition Programs.

                          receive such an honor. October 05, 2022 LA JOLLA, CA—Scripps Research professor K. Barry Sharpless,
                          PhD, has been awarded the 2022 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his groundbreaking research in
                          developing “click chemistry,” an ingenious method for building molecules. Sharpless, the W.M. Keck
                          Professor of Chemistry, shares the prize with Carolyn R. Bertozzi, PhD, of Stanford University and
                          Morten Meldal, PhD, of the University of Copenhagen for the development of click chemistry and
                          bioorthogonal chemistry, according to the Nobel Prize committee. Sharpless previously shared the
                          2001 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on chirally catalyzed oxidation reactions, making him
                          the second scientist ever to win two Nobel Prizes in Chemistry. Frederick Sanger won the Nobel
                          Prize in Chemistry in 1958 and 1980. “Barry Sharpless has had a tremendous impact on chemistry,
                          first with his development of asymmetric synthesis and now with his elegant ‘click chemistry,’”
                          says Peter Schultz, PhD, President and CEO of Scripps Research. “His work opened whole new
                          scientific frontiers that have had a major impact on the fields of chemistry, biology and medicine.

                          Lost Ark was fully released in South Korea on December 4, 2019, and in North American, South
                          American, and European regions on February 11, 2022, with Amazon Games serving as the global
                          publisher.[16] Users that pre-purchased one of four founder's packs could play 3 days early on
                          February 8, 2022.[17][18][19][20] The game was initially unavailable in Belgium and the Netherlands
                          due to the countries' stringent loot box regulations,[21] with the latter later reversing its
                          decision.[22] Within twenty-four hours of its release, Lost Ark became the second most played game
                          on Steam.[23][24] In 2021, there were plans between Smilegate and game publisher HappyTuk [zh] to
                          launch Lost Ark in Taiwan.[25] It was announced in 2023 that the release of Taiwanese servers has
                          been delayed but not canceled.[26] Lost Ark received "generally favorable" reviews according to
                          review aggregator Metacritic.[27] PC Magazine praised Lost Ark's combat, writing, "Abilities look
                          good, sound sufficiently powerful, and feel great to use. You can’t help but feel like a combat god
                          when you divekick a crowd, and blast fodder monsters into bloody chunks.

                          Coburn Project was given a pilot order by NBC. It was created by Nicholas Wootton and Jake Coburn
                          who were expected to executive produce alongside Julie Plec and Emily Cummins. Wootton also wrote
                          the pilot.[5] On September 21, 2021, NBC ordered The Endgame to series. Justin Lin and Andrew

                          The show centered on a professional thief named Mickey O’Neil (played by the dashing Dougray
                          Scott), the man who was orchestrating probably one of the biggest heists that Los Angeles – and
                          maybe even the world – had ever seen. Mickey put together a handpicked team of experts to
                          simultaneously rob three big jewelry stores along Rodeo Drive during the Academy Awards when
                          everyone was too distracted by the glitz and glamor of Hollywood’s elite to notice the elaborate
                          heist unfold. NBC’s newest foray into the heist TV drama genre is The Endgame which just recently
                          premiered on the network. Starring Morena Baccarin and Ryan Michelle Bathé, The Endgame follows
                          Elena Federova, an international arms dealer and criminal mastermind who was recently captured by
                          the FBI. Elena has orchestrated a number of bank heists all across New York and nobody knows why.
                          But FBI agent Val Turner gets put on the case and might just be able to foil Elena’s ambitious plan
                          and discover what her endgame is. The only thing better than watching a heist unfold on a scripted
                          TV show is watching it unfold knowing it’s completely based on real-life events. That’s exactly the
                          case with ITV’s four-part miniseries titled Hatton Garden (also known as The Heist at Hatton
                          Garden), which is based on the real-life burglary of a safety deposit vault in the eponymous Hatton
                          Garden, London.

Question 28              : When did Russia invade Ukraine?

                          Jump to Russia surprised the world on February 24, 2022, by invading Ukraine, starting a brutal
                          battle that is still raging today. Russia's President Vladimir Putin has given varying public
                          explanations for why he launched the invasion. Here are the reasons Putin gave, how they match with
                          reality, and the other likely reasons why Russia sent its armed forces into an independent,
                          sovereign nation. Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union, before declaring itself an independent
                          country, cementing the move in a referendum days before the USSR collapsed in December 1991. The
                          country has maintained its independence ever since. But Putin still refers to Ukraine as Russian,
                          and denies it's a nation in its own right. He told then-US President George W. Bush in 2008 that
                          Ukraine wasn't even a country. Stephen Hall, a Russian politics expert at the University of Bath in
                          the UK, said many Russians still hold this view, and that "it isn't just the Kremlin." Hall said
                          Russia sees Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, as the "mother of Russian cities," and for Putin he can't
                          have that being outside his own country. Hall added that Russia needs to claim Ukraine in order to
                          back up its argument to being a great power that has existed for millennia. Without it "Russia
                          can't claim a thousand years of history because Kyiv was already in existence 1,200 years ago, when
                          Moscow was a forest," he said.

                          that Putin was under public pressure to invade Ukraine, which suggests at least some of his
                          reasoning was personal. All three experts said Putin's desire to be revered in history books likely
                          motivated him to attack. Hall said Putin's anxiety is around "am I going to be a footnote in

                          leader restoring Russian lands, and he was thinking about his legacy as he turned 70." "What have
                          the great Czars done? They've expanded Russian territory," Graham said. Even with all of the above,
                          why the invasion happened when it did is an intriguing question. Experts pointed to multiple
                          reasons why Russia invaded in February 2022. One was the arrival of Zelenskyy, who came to power in
                          2019 after a career as a comedian and actor. Putin believed that in Zelenskyy "he had someone he
                          could manipulate in Ukraine," Hall said.

                          Elden Ring[a] is a 2022 action role-playing game developed by FromSoftware. It was directed by
                          Hidetaka Miyazaki with worldbuilding provided by fantasy writer George R. R. Martin. It was
                          released for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S on February 25 by
                          FromSoftware in Japan and Bandai Namco Entertainment internationally. Players control a
                          customizable player character who is on a quest to repair the Elden Ring and become the new Elden
                          Lord. Elden Ring is presented through a third-person perspective; players freely roam its
                          interactive open world. The six main areas are traversed using the player character's steed Torrent
                          as the primary mode of travel. Linear, hidden dungeons can be explored to find useful items.
                          Players can use several types of weapons and magic spells, including non-direct engagement enabled
                          by stealth mechanics. Throughout the game's world, checkpoints enable fast travel and allow players
                          to improve their attributes using an in-game currency called Runes. Elden Ring has an online
                          multiplayer mode in which players can join each other for cooperative and player-versus-player
                          combat. During planning, FromSoftware wanted to create an open-world game with gameplay similar to
                          Dark Souls; the company wanted Elden Ring to act as an evolution of the self-titled debut of the
                          series. Miyazaki admired the work of Martin, whose contributions he hoped would produce a more
                          accessible narrative than those of the company's earlier games.

                          and you’d certainly be hard pushed to find a better Game of the Year contender outside
                          FromSoftware’s latest action RPG. But despite many fans diving back into the game over and over
                          again (there is 6 endings after all), most of the community are desperate to see what the developer
                          does with the game next, especially with regards to more post-launch content. At this point,
                          nothing has been officially announced with both FromSoftware and Publisher Bandai Namco avoiding
                          any concrete answers on the future of the game. That being said, FromSoftware does have a history
                          of releasing DLC for their previous titles. Dark Souls 1-3, Bloodborne and Sekiro: Shadows Die
                          Twice all received hefty post-launch support and content updates. There have also been hints in
                          press releases, with one including a quote from Bandai Namco Entertainment President and CEO Yasuo
                          Miyakawa which talks about “expanding the brand beyond the game itself”. Clearly Bandai Namco know
                          they need to capitalise on a game as significant as Elden Ring, and you would imagine one of the
                          easiest ways to do that would be via post launch content.

                          the second WTA 1000 title of her career. 0: Wins for Swiatek against Maria Sakkari (0-3) and Aryna

                          The second set was entirely different from the first. While Jabeur again didn't win a game until
                          Swiatek was up 3-0, she finally found her gear. Her excellent slice finally began to appear and she
                          began going to the net more, helping her win four of the next five games. Swiatek appeared to have
                          finally wrestled the momentum of the match back to her side, breaking a 5-5 tie to get within one
                          game of the title, but she couldn't close and Jabeur tied it up once again. The tiebreak was close,
                          and it looked like Jabeur could run away with it at any moment, but an unforced error from Jabeur
                          ended the tiebreak and gave Swiatek her first US Open championship and her third career Grand Slam
                          trophy. When it was all over, Swiatek and Jabeur shared a heartfelt embrace, and then Swiatek
                          immediately burst into happy tears. She'd earned it. This victory puts an exclamation point on the
                          best year of Swiatek's young career — or the best year of anyone’s career, really. She started 2022
                          by falling just short of the finals at the Australian Open (she was knocked out in the semis by
                          Danielle Collins), but she rebounded to produce one of the most dominant stretches of tennis we’ve
                          seen in decades. Swiatek beat Annet Kontaveit to win the Qatar Open.

                          Tournament, for sponsorship reasons) was the postseason men's basketball tournament for the 2021–22
                          Atlantic Coast Conference men's basketball season. It was held at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn,
                          New York, during March 8–12, 2022.[1] The 2022 tournament was the 69th annual edition of the
                          tournament. The Virginia Tech Hokies won the tournament, their first ACC Tournament title and only
                          their second conference tournament title in program history, receiving the conference's automatic
                          bid to the 2022 NCAA tournament. The Hokies were the second ACC champion to win four tournament
                          games to secure the title and were the lowest overall seed to win the title.[2] All 15 ACC teams
                          participate in the tournament. Teams were seeded by conference record, with a tiebreaker system to
                          seed teams that finished with identical conference records.[3] Duke secured the regular season
                          title and the first overall seed. Notre Dame, North Carolina, and Miami were the other teams to
                          secure double-byes.[4] ‡ – ACC Regular Season Champions.† – Received a double-bye in the conference

                          The film is based on the Boom! Comics book of the same name and would help kick off Fox’s brand-new

                          “Irredeemable” follows superhero-turned-villain, the Plutonian, as he goes on a killing rampage.
                          It’s up to the superhero group The Paradigm to stop him.

                          ‘Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters’ writer-director Tommy Wirkola will pen the script. Adam McKay is
                          no stranger to superheroes or comic book adaptations. He worked on the script for Ant-Man, he's
                          working on the sequel Ant-Man and the Wasp, and he long circled an adaptation of Garth Ennis’ The
                          Boys. However, it looks like his directing debut on a superhero film will be for an adaptation of
                          the Mark Waid comic Irredeemable. According to Deadline, McKay has signed on to helm an adaptation
                          of the book, which is about “the Plutonian, the world’s greatest superhero until he began
                          heartlessly slaughtering the population of Earth, at least those who defy him. It falls to a
                          superhero group known as the Paradigm to stop his rampage. They were former colleagues of the
                          Plutonian, they’ve all got problems of their own, and none of them is nearly as powerful as the
                          mass-murdering maniac holding the world hostage. In Clarice-Hannibal Lecter fashion, the Paradigm
                          in desperation turns to a famous supervillain for help; it might be the only way to stop the
                          carnage.” This sounds like a fun premise, and definitely swims in the darkness that McKay has shown
                          he can handle with The Big Short. However, I’m a bit pessimistic on the choice for writing the
                          script.

                          Zhurong (Chinese: 祝融; pinyin: Zhùróng) is a Chinese rover on Mars, the country's first to land on
                          another planet after it previously landed two rovers on the Moon. The rover is part of the
                          Tianwen-1 mission to Mars conducted by the China National Space Administration (CNSA). The
                          spacecraft was launched on 23 July 2020 and inserted into Martian orbit on 10 February 2021. The
                          lander, carrying the rover, performed a soft-landing on Mars on 14 May 2021,[3] making China the
                          third country to successfully soft-land a spacecraft on Mars and the second one to deploy a rover
                          on Mars, after the United States.[4][N 1] Zhurong was deployed on 22 May 2021, 02:40 UTC.[6]
                          Designed for a lifespan of 90 sols (93 Earth days),[7] Zhurong has been active for 347 sols (356.5
                          days) since its deployment on Mars's surface.[8] The rover has been inactive since 20 May 2022 due
                          to approaching sandstorms and Martian winter, pending its self-awakening at an appropriate
                          temperature and sunlight condition.[9][10]

                          On 14 November 2019, CNSA invited some foreign embassies and international organizations to witness
                          hovering and obstacle avoidance test for the Mars Lander of China's first Mars exploration mission
                          at the extraterrestrial celestial landing test site. It was the first public appearance of China's
                          Mars exploration mission.[46] As the mission preparation proceeded, in April 2020, the mission was
                          formally named "Tianwen-1".[47] On 23 July 2020, Tianwen-1 was launched from Wenchang Spacecraft
                          Launch Site on the island of Hainan atop a Long March 5 heavy-lift launch vehicle.[22] In September
                          2020, the Tianwen-1 orbiter deployed the Tianwen-1 First Deployable Camera (TDC-1), a small
                          satellite with two cameras that took photos of and tested a radio connection with Tianwen-1.[10]
                          Its mission was to photograph the Tianwen-1 orbiter and the lander's heat shield.[10] Due to the
                          time when it was deployed, it trajectory predicted to do a flyby of Mars with that happening around
                          the orbit insertion date. During its cruise to Mars, the spacecraft completed four trajectory
                          correction maneuvers plus an additional maneuver to alter its heliocentric orbital inclination; it
                          also performed self diagnostics on multiple payloads.

                          Corban award winner to pull ahead of the pack, as Warrior Men's Track & Field distance runner
                          Robert Swoboda nabbed this most recent achievement following his acceptance of the 2022 Oregon
                          Sports Awards' Small College Male Athlete of the Year honor over the past summer. Following an
                          incredible 2022 season, Swoboda now holds the school records in the 1500m (3:56.69), 5000m
                          (14:35.75), and 10000m (29:32.69) races as the long-distance leader for Corban. Alongside Olson at
                          the 2022 NAIA Outdoor Track & Field National Championship, he captured the second individual
                          national championship for Warrior Nation later that same day thanks to a phenomenally ran race in
                          the 10,000 meters, and was now the first male student-athlete to do so in the navy and gold clad
                          uniforms for the Corban. Swoboda also carries additional hardware with him into this school honor,
                          including the 2022 CCC 5000m championship title, multiple CCC Track Athlete of the Week awards, and
                          was a qualifier for the 2021 NAIA Cross Country National Championships. "When I first started
                          working with Rob in the fall of 2019, he told me he was going to be a national champion." Bos said
                          about his second individual national champ.

                          “Jada, I love you,” Rock said. “G.I. Jane 2, can’t wait to see it, all right?” Pinkett’s face went
                          stony, and Smith got to his feet, marched onto the stage, and slapped Rock in the face. The audio
                          of the US broadcast went out at that point, but it continued uncensored in other countries,
                          including Japan and Australia. “Wow! Wow!” said Rock, swaying slightly as Smith strode back to his
                          seat. “Will Smith just smacked the shit out of me, everybody.” “Keep my wife’s name out your
                          fucking mouth,” Smith shouted from the audience. “Wow, dude,” said Rock. “It was a G.I. Jane joke.”
                          “Keep my wife’s name out your fucking mouth,” Smith repeated. “I’m going to. Okay?” said Rock. He
                          paused for a second, double-taking, and the audio in the US came back again just in time to catch
                          him saying, “That was the greatest night in the history of television. Okay. Okay.” Then he went on
                          with presenting the Oscar (which went to Summer of Soul, directed by Questlove). Just minutes
                          later, Smith won the Oscar for Best Actor for his performance in King Richard, in which he played
                          Richard Williams, father of Venus and Serena Williams. “Richard Williams was a fierce defender of
                          his family,” Smith began as he took the stage.

                          In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Kenny shared that he thinks Smith’s apology was nothing
                          more than a PR move. “No, I don’t accept it because I don’t think it was genuine,” he said. “I
                          think his publicist and the people that work under him probably advised him to do that.” (Another
                          of Rock’s other brothers, Tony, also said he does not accept Smith’s apology and said the entire
                          fiasco was “foul.”) He continued, “I might have looked at it differently had he initially
                          apologized when he got on the stage and cried and accepted the award, but he didn’t, so, right
                          there that tells me that it is something else.” As for Smith remaining in the ceremony after
                          slapping Rock, and later accepting the best actor award for his role in King Richard? Kenny (as
                          well as other celebrities in attendance) believes that was a misstep on the Academy’s part. “He
                          should have been escorted out of there,” he said. “I hold them accountable for that. He could have

                          did.” Kenny added that Smith “belittled my brother. He had no respect for him. … In my opinion, he
                          embarrassed himself by doing that and his legacy by doing that.”

                          In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Kenny shared that he thinks Smith’s apology was nothing
                          more than a PR move. “No, I don’t accept it because I don’t think it was genuine,” he said. “I
                          think his publicist and the people that work under him probably advised him to do that.” (Another
                          of Rock’s other brothers, Tony, also said he does not accept Smith’s apology and said the entire
                          fiasco was “foul.”) He continued, “I might have looked at it differently had he initially
                          apologized when he got on the stage and cried and accepted the award, but he didn’t, so, right
                          there that tells me that it is something else.” As for Smith remaining in the ceremony after
                          slapping Rock, and later accepting the best actor award for his role in King Richard? Kenny (as
                          well as other celebrities in attendance) believes that was a misstep on the Academy’s part. “He
                          should have been escorted out of there,” he said. “I hold them accountable for that. He could have
                          went up there and did anything you wanted to my brother. It could have been much worse than what he
                          did.” Kenny added that Smith “belittled my brother. He had no respect for him. … In my opinion, he

Question 42              : When did Apple M2 chip?

                          Apple M2 is a series of ARM-based system on a chip (SoC) designed by Apple Inc. as a central
                          processing unit (CPU) and graphics processing unit (GPU) for its Mac desktops and notebooks, and
                          the iPad Pro tablet. It is the second generation of ARM architecture intended for Apple's Mac
                          computers after switching from Intel Core to Apple silicon, succeeding the M1. Apple announced the
                          M2 on June 6, 2022, at WWDC, along with models of the MacBook Air and the 13-inch MacBook Pro using
                          the M2. The M2 is made with TSMC's "Enhanced 5-nanometer technology" N5P process and contains 20
                          billion transistors, a 25% increase from the M1. Apple claims CPU improvements up to 18% and GPU
                          improvements up to 35% compared to the M1.[3] The M2 was followed by the professional-focused M2
                          Pro and M2 Max chips in January 2023. The M2 Max is a higher-powered version of the M2 Pro, with
                          more GPU cores and memory bandwidth, and a larger die size.[4] Apple introduced the M2 Ultra in
                          June 2023, combining two M2 Max chips in one package.[1]

                          Apple in June 2022 unveiled the M2, its next-generation Apple silicon chip that followed the M1
                          chip. This guide highlights everything you need to know about the M2 chip, from performance
                          improvements to extra features. The M2 is Apple's next-generation System on a Chip (SoC) developed
                          for use in Macs and iPads. It marks Apple's continued work to transition away from the Intel chips
                          that were used in Macs up until 2020. As a "System on a Chip," the M2 integrates several different
                          components, including the CPU, GPU, unified memory architecture (RAM), Neural Engine, Secure
                          Enclave, SSD controller, image signal processor, encode/decode engines, Thunderbolt controller with
                          USB 4 support, and more, all of which power the different features in the Mac. Before Apple
                          silicon, Macs used multiple chips for CPU, I/O, and security, but Apple's effort to integrate these
                          chips is the reason why the M2 is much faster and more efficient than Intel chips. The unified
                          memory architecture that Apple has included is also a major factor because all of the technologies
                          in the M2 are able to access the same data without having to swap between multiple pools of memory.
                          Built into the M2 chip, the unified memory architecture means the CPU, GPU, and other processor
                          components don't need to copy data between one another, and are able to access the same data pool.

                          relatively modest commercial and critical success triumph over so many of 2021’s biggest albums?
                          Here are five reasons that might begin to explain it. 1. Nomination momentum. A little meta here,
                          but sometimes recognition breeds recognition with award shows — and going into the voting, no
                          artist was more recognized in the nominations at this year’s Grammys than Jon Batiste. The
                          singer/songwriter/instrumentalist scored a staggering 11 nods for the evening, including an
                          additional Big Four nomination in song of the year (for “Freedom”), and genre nods that ranged from
                          best R&B performance to best improvised jazz solo to to best American roots song. Such a large
                          number of nominations (three more than any other artist on Sunday) is bound to grab attention, and
                          perhaps a number of ballots from future voters who might’ve otherwise not been familiar: If you’re
                          doing some light research but don’t have time to check out all the nominees you don’t already know,
                          you’d be more likely to check out the artist with 11 nominations than one with just a handful (or
                          only the one, in the case of Taylor Swift and Evermore). You might also be more likely to vote for
                          them, since anyone with that many nominations clearly has some chance of winning the top prize. 2.

                          Tesla's global production and sales results in the first quarter of 2022 did not disappoint.
                          Deliveries reached another quarterly record, while the production was at a near-record level.
                          That's outstanding news considering how challenging the global economy and automotive industry is
                          in particular. In this post, we will take a look at the numbers and charts to visualize the
                          progress and better understand what can be achieved in the near future. Let's get into details.
                          Tesla increased its overall electric car production in Q1 by about 69% year-over-year to 305,407,
                          just a few hundred units below the record of 305,407 set in Q4 2021. The lion's share falls on the
                          Model 3/Model Y - over 291,000. Another bit of positive news is that the production of the
                          refreshed Model S/Model X further increased compared to Q4. The preliminary sales result (customer
                          deliveries) was at a record high of 310,048 (up 68% year-over-year). The Model 3/Y reached an
                          all-time record, while the Model S/X pair improved towards the levels seen in the previous years.
                          Q1 2022 (YOY change) "In the first quarter, we produced over 305,000 vehicles and delivered over
                          310,000 vehicles, despite ongoing supply chain challenges and factory shutdowns." During the past
                          four quarters, Tesla produced and delivered more than 1 million electric cars.

                          Tesla offered two rebates for buyers taking delivery of a vehicle before the end of the year,
                          initially offering a $3,750 discount then doubling the rebate to $7,500 with two weeks left in
                          2022. Investors were rattled by the rebates, sending the stock plunging 37% in December alone.
                          Tesla thanked customers and employees for helping the company “achieve a great 2022 in light of
                          significant Covid and supply chain related challenges throughout the year,” according to a
                          statement released on Monday. The company also said it was proud of its growth and progress. “We

                          further increase in cars in transit at the end of the quarter,” the statement read. Tesla said it
                          delivered 1.25 million of its less-expensive Model 3 and Model Y electric cars, and nearly 67,000

                          Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Tesla delivered a record number of cars last year, as
                          sales continued to grow by percentages any other major automaker would dream about. But Tesla still
                          managed to disappoint Wall Street throughout 2022 – and the last quarter was no different. The
                          electric automaker delivered 1.3 million vehicles in 2022, up 40% from 2021. It produced nearly 1.4
                          million vehicles, up 47% from the prior year. Yet the fourth quarter underwhelmed: Tesla delivered
                          only 405,278 vehicles, well below the median estimate of 431,000 according to analysts polled by
                          Refinitiv, as recession fears and higher interest rates led to a slowdown in demand. Although 40%
                          growth is nothing to sneeze at, Tesla’s pace of growth is slowing. Deliveries nearly doubled in
                          2021 and more than quadrupled in 2020. Tesla’s (TSLA) stock plunged 65% in 2022 as demand weakened.
                          Competition in electric vehicles from established automakers surged last year. The company missed
                          its growth targets throughout the year and it scaled back production in China. Evidence of car
                          buyers’ sinking interest in Teslas became apparent last month after the company announced a rare
                          sale in a bid to clear out inventory.

                          On May 4, the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee of the House of Commons of the United
                          Kingdom summoned Musk to discuss the effect of his buyout on free speech and "online harms".[66]
                          Musk secured another $7.1 billion in funding the next day, including from Oracle Corporation
                          co-founder Larry Ellison, Saudi prince Al Waleed bin Talal Al Saud, venture capital firms
                          Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital, as well as sovereign wealth fund Qatar Holding.[67][68]
                          The equity infusion reduced his original $12.5 billion personal bank loan to $6.25 billion and his
                          required cash equity contribution from $21 billion to just under $20 billion.[34][69] On May 11,
                          The Wall Street Journal reported that the SEC and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) had launched
                          investigations into events leading to the acquisition.[70] The next day, Agrawal fired Twitter
                          general manager Kayvon Beykpour and revenue product lead Bruce Falck.[71] On May 13, Musk revealed
                          that he had placed the deal "on hold" in the wake of reports that 5 percent of Twitter's daily
                          active users were spam accounts,[72] causing Twitter shares to drop more than 10 percent.[73] Musk
                          clarified that he remained committed to the acquisition,[74] and Agrawal stated he expected the
                          deal to close.

                          Twitter, Inc. (NYSE: TWTR) today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to be
                          acquired by an entity wholly owned by Elon Musk, for $54.20 per share in cash in a transaction
                          valued at approximately $44 billion. Upon completion of the transaction, Twitter will become a
                          privately held company. Under the terms of the agreement, Twitter stockholders will receive $54.20
                          in cash for each share of Twitter common stock that they own upon closing of the proposed
                          transaction. The purchase price represents a 38% premium to Twitter's closing stock price on April
                          1, 2022, which was the last trading day before Mr. Musk disclosed his approximately 9% stake in
                          Twitter. Bret Taylor, Twitter's Independent Board Chair, said, "The Twitter Board conducted a
                          thoughtful and comprehensive process to assess Elon's proposal with a deliberate focus on value,

                          At least one of the executives who was fired was escorted out of Twitter’s office, they said. Mr.
                          Musk, who is one of Twitter’s most active users and has more than 109 million followers, began
                          accumulating shares in the company this year. In April, he struck the deal to buy the company for
                          $44 billion and said he would lift Twitter’s content moderation policies, eliminate spam, add new
                          features and provide more transparency about the algorithms used to promote content. “Twitter has
                          tremendous potential — I look forward to working with the company and the community of users to
                          unlock it,” he said in a statement in April. But, within weeks, he began questioning the deal. Mr.
                          Musk lashed out at the Twitter executives responsible for content decisions and accused the company
                          of failing to accurately count the spam accounts on its platform. When Parag Agrawal, Twitter’s
                          chief executive, tried debunking Mr. Musk’s claims, Mr. Musk responded by tweeting a poop emoji. By
                          July, Mr. Musk had decided that he no longer wanted to own Twitter, arguing that he had been misled
                          about the amount of spam on the platform. He announced his intent to abandon the acquisition.
                          Twitter sued Mr. Musk to force him to carry out the agreement. The company accused Mr. Musk of
                          trying to back out of the deal because the economic downturn had caused a decline in his personal
                          wealth. Mr. Musk had agreed to personally provide roughly $33 billion of the $44 billion deal.

                          After building a stake in Twitter at the start of the year, Mr Musk made his $44bn offer in April,
                          a price tag that looked too high almost as soon as it was agreed. He said he was buying it because
                          he wanted "civilisation to have a common digital town square" and said he planned to clean up spam
                          accounts and preserve the platform as a venue for free speech. But by the summer he had changed his
                          mind about the purchase, citing concerns that the number of fake accounts on the platform was
                          higher than Twitter claimed. The Elon Musk Show From South Africa to Silicon Valley - the

                          through. But speculation continues around Mr Musk's intentions for the platform. Earlier this week,

                          reins at the firm himself. Mr Musk also tweeted a video of himself walking into Twitter's
                          headquarters in San Francisco carrying a sink with the caption: "let that sink in!" There has been
                          no comment yet from Twitter about its new management team.

                          Scottie Scheffler won the 2022 Masters on Sunday following a dominant performance at Augusta
                          National. The world No. 1 finished ahead of Northern Irishman Rory McIlroy to claim his first major
                          title. After two close-range misses on the 18th green, he rolled home the winning putt and carded a
                          final round one-under par 71 to finish on 10-under for the tournament, three shots ahead of
                          second-placed McIlroy. Over the four days at the lush, sprawling golf club in Augusta, Georgia,

                          The 2022 Australian Open was a Grand Slam tennis tournament that took place at Melbourne Park,
                          Australia from 17 to 30 January 2022.[2] It was the 110th edition of the Australian Open, the 54th
                          in the Open Era, and the first Grand Slam of the year. The tournament consisted of events for
                          professional players in singles, doubles and mixed doubles. Junior and wheelchair players competed
                          in singles and doubles tournaments. As in previous years, the tournament's main sponsor was Kia.
                          The men's singles title was won by Rafael Nadal, and was Nadal's 21st major title, and his second
                          Australian Open. He defeated second seed Daniil Medvedev in the final, winning in five sets after
                          being two sets down. In winning the title, Nadal broke the record for all-time men's major singles
                          title - it was previously tied at 20 between himself, Novak Djokovic, and Roger Federer. The
                          women's singles title was won by Ashleigh Barty, who won her first Australian Open title and third
                          major title. She defeated 27th seed Danielle Collins in straight sets. Barty was the first
                          Australian to win the title since Chris O'Neil won the title in 1978. The final would also prove to
                          be Barty's last professional match, with Barty announcing her retirement in March 2022.

                          The 2022 Australian Open was a Grand Slam tennis tournament that took place at Melbourne Park,
                          Australia from 17 to 30 January 2022.[2] It was the 110th edition of the Australian Open, the 54th
                          in the Open Era, and the first Grand Slam of the year. The tournament consisted of events for
                          professional players in singles, doubles and mixed doubles. Junior and wheelchair players competed
                          in singles and doubles tournaments. As in previous years, the tournament's main sponsor was Kia.
                          The men's singles title was won by Rafael Nadal, and was Nadal's 21st major title, and his second
                          Australian Open. He defeated second seed Daniil Medvedev in the final, winning in five sets after
                          being two sets down. In winning the title, Nadal broke the record for all-time men's major singles
                          title - it was previously tied at 20 between himself, Novak Djokovic, and Roger Federer. The
                          women's singles title was won by Ashleigh Barty, who won her first Australian Open title and third
                          major title. She defeated 27th seed Danielle Collins in straight sets. Barty was the first
                          Australian to win the title since Chris O'Neil won the title in 1978. The final would also prove to
                          be Barty's last professional match, with Barty announcing her retirement in March 2022.

                          She also knew that all of the effort she put in, to overcome self-doubt and those dreaded
                          double-faults, had to pay off eventually. Just had to. And so, as she wasted a second match point
                          by flubbing a forehand, and a third by again missing another, Sabalenka did her best to stay calm,
                          something she used to find quite difficult. She hung in there until a fourth chance to close out
                          Elena Rybakina presented itself — and this time, Sabalenka saw a forehand from her similarly
                          powerful foe sail long. That was that. The championship belonged to Sabalenka via a 4-6, 6-3, 6-4
                          comeback victory over Wimbledon winner Rybakina. “The last game, yeah, of course, I was a little
                          bit nervous. I (kept) telling myself, like, ’Nobody tells you that it’s going to be easy.’ You just
                          have to work for it, work for it, ’til the last point,” said Sabalenka, a 24-year-old from Belarus
                          who is now 11-0 with two titles in 2023 and will rise to No. 2 in the WTA rankings on Monday. “I’m
                          super happy that I was able to handle all those emotions,” she said, “and win this one.” The only
                          set she has dropped all season was the opener on Saturday against Rybakina, who eliminated No.

  - Source              :
                          Rafael Nadal defeated Daniil Medvedev in the final, 2–6, 6–7(5–7), 6–4, 6–4, 7–5 to win the men's
                          singles tennis title at the 2022 Australian Open.[1] It was his second Australian Open title and
                          21st major singles title overall, surpassing the all-time record he had jointly held with Roger
                          Federer and Novak Djokovic.[2][3] Nadal became the fourth man, after Roy Emerson, Rod Laver, and
                          Djokovic, to achieve the double career Grand Slam, and the second in the Open Era.[4] He also
                          became the first man in the Open Era to win an Australian Open final after losing the first two
                          sets.[5] This marked the third consecutive year a man trailed by two sets in a major final yet
                          rallied to win, following Djokovic's two-set comeback at the 2021 French Open and Dominic Thiem's
                          at the 2020 US Open.[6] Djokovic was the three-time reigning champion,[7] but did not compete after
                          his visa was cancelled shortly before the tournament began due to an intervention from Australia's
                          Immigration Minister Alex Hawke, citing risks to public health and good order in Australia.[8] That
                          meant Nadal was the only former champion (2009) to compete in the tournament, with both Federer and
                          Stan Wawrinka sidelined by injury.

                          Djokovic deeply felt this major title, his 22nd, calling it “a huge relief.” By Christopher Clarey
                          After missing last year’s tournament when he was deported for being unvaccinated for Covid-19, the
                          Serb beat Stefanos Tsitsipas of Greece in straight sets to win his 22nd Grand Slam title. By

                          the Australian Open has allowed players to be coached from the stands. By Christopher Clarey The
                          Belarusian, who beat Elena Rybakina to win her first Grand Slam title on Saturday, held the trophy
                          in triumph while the war in Ukraine remained a brutal reality. By Christopher Clarey The
                          24-year-old Belarusian player pushed Elena Rybakina of Kazakhstan to three sets to capture her
                          first Grand Slam singles title. By Matthew Futterman At 84 years old, the man with his name on the
                          stadium sits courtside at the Australian Open. He likes what he sees. By Matthew Futterman Mirza,
                          who leaves tennis in India as a sleeping giant, has been a trailblazer nonetheless. “I would like
                          to have a quieter life,” she said after the mixed doubles final.

                          season.[2] Świątek also became the youngest winner of multiple majors since Maria Sharapova in
                          2006.[3] Barbora Krejčíková was the defending champion,[4] but she lost in the first round to Diane

Correct Answers         :

                          Novak Djokovic defeated Casper Ruud in the final, 7–6(7–1), 6–3, 7–5 to win the men's singles
                          tennis title at the 2023 French Open. It was his third French Open title and his record-breaking
                          23rd men's singles major title overall, surpassing the record he previously held jointly with
                          Rafael Nadal.[1] With the victory, Djokovic became the first man to achieve a triple career Grand
                          Slam, and became the oldest French Open champion at the age of 36 years and 20 days.[2] Nadal was
                          the reigning champion,[3] but withdrew due to a left hip injury. This was the first time the
                          14-time champion missed the tournament since his debut in 2005.[4] With his withdrawal, Nadal fell
                          out of the top 100 of the ATP rankings for the first time since 2003.[5] By winning the title,
                          Djokovic reclaimed the world No. 1 singles ranking from Carlos Alcaraz; Daniil Medvedev and
                          Stefanos Tsitsipas were also in contention for the top ranking at the beginning of the
                          tournament.[6][7] Medvedev's loss to Thiago Seyboth Wild in the first round marked the first time
                          since 2000 that the second seed (then Pete Sampras) lost in the opening round.

Question 61              : who the women's singles wimbledon 2022?
Correct Answers         :

  - Source              :
                          Elena Rybakina defeated Ons Jabeur in the final, 3–6, 6–2, 6–2 to win the ladies' singles tennis
                          title at the 2022 Wimbledon Championships.[1] It was her first major singles title.[2] Rybakina
                          became the first Kazakhstani[i] to win a major title, and the third player representing an Asian
                          nation to win a major title after Li Na and Naomi Osaka. She also became the first Kazakhstani to
                          progress past the quarterfinals of a major.[3] Rybakina was the first player to win from a set down
                          in the final since Amélie Mauresmo in 2006. Jabeur became the first Arab to reach a major singles
                          final, the first African woman to do so in the Open Era, and the first African woman to do so not
                          representing South Africa.[4][ii] This marked the first time since 2009 that both finalists
                          represented non-European nations. Ashleigh Barty was the reigning champion, but retired from
                          professional tennis in March 2022.[5] World No. 1 Iga Świątek's win streak of 37 matches (dating to
                          Qatar in February) ended when she was defeated by Alizé Cornet in the third round.

                          was a lot more memorable: She is leaving as a Grand Slam champion. Vondrousova became the first

                          If Novak Djokovic does not successfully defend his Wimbledon title in 2023, the absence of Rafael
                          Nadal through injury and Roger Federer through retirement makes it likely that only the fifth
                          different male winner since 2002 will lift the trophy. In the women's section, world No.1 Iga
                          Swiatek was hoping to be victorious at the All England Club for the first time. Carlos Alcaraz, the
                          top-ranked man in the world, is bidding to win a first SW19 title against Djokovic, while unseeded

                          If Novak Djokovic does not successfully defend his Wimbledon title in 2023, the absence of Rafael
                          Nadal through injury and Roger Federer through retirement makes it likely that only the fifth
                          different male winner since 2002 will lift the trophy. In the women's section, world No.1 Iga
                          Swiatek was hoping to be victorious at the All England Club for the first time. Carlos Alcaraz, the
                          top-ranked man in the world, is bidding to win a first SW19 title against Djokovic, while unseeded
                          Czech Marketa Vondrousova won the women's competition, condemning Ons Jabeur to a second
                          consecutive defeat in the final. Whose footsteps will the champions be following? Here's who won

                          title and his seventh at SW19. It wasn't all plain sailing for one of the most decorated players in
                          Wimbledon history: Djokovic dropped sets in all but two of his seven matches, recovering from two

                          2023 Wimbledon Championships have come to an end with Carlos Alcaraz and Markéta Vondroušová
                          becoming the latest winners of the iconic grass tournament singles events in England. Alcaraz, who
                          entered the competition as the No. 1 seed in the gentlemen's draw, got past No. 2 Novak Djokovic in
                          the final by a score of 1-6, 7-6 (8-6), 6-1, 3-6, 6-4. That was not an easy task, as the Serbian
                          veteran was riding a 34-winning streak at Wimbledon and had not lost at the All England Club since
                          2017. Their meeting on Sunday lasted four hours and 42 minutes. It was a short-awaited rematch from
                          the French Open semifinal last month when Djokovic came out victorious in four sets. Alcaraz had
                          struggled with cramps at Roland-Garros, but the 20-year-old stayed solid at the All England Club to
                          claim the second Grand Slam title of his young career. On the women's side, Markéta Vondroušová
                          became the first unseeded woman to win the Wimbledon singles title with a 6-4,6-4 victory over No.

                          6 seed Ons Jabeur. Its only the second WTA tour win for Vondroušová -- her first since 2017 --
                          who'll move to No. 10 in the WTA rankings with the win. Jabeur, meanwhile is the runner up at
                          Wimbledon for a second straight year, and has lost all three of her career Grand Slam finals.
                          Djokovic didn't walk away with a trophy, but the 23-time Grand Slam champion was still able to add
                          more achievements to his already impressive resume at Wimbledon. With his second-round victory
                          against Jordan Thompson, Djokovic became one of only three players in tennis history with 350 wins
                          in Grand Slam singles matches -- joining Serena Williams and Rafael Nadal. After taking down No. 7
                          Andrey Rublev in Tuesday's quarterfinals, Djokovic reached a major semifinal for the 46th time in
                          his career, tying Roger Federer's all-time men's record. This year's Wimbledon has had headlines
                          that are not all about the game. The All England Club increased security after protesters had been
                          disrupting other events in England, however, two climate protesters still managed to interrupt the
                          first-round match between Sho Shimabukuro and Grigor Dimitrov. Two people were arrested after they
                          threw orange-colored confetti and jigsaw puzzle pieces onto Court 18.

                          at the 2005 French Open, the youngest US Open champion since Pete Sampras in 1990, the first man

                          to reach the title match, something no one had done in New York in 30 years. Alcaraz dropped the
                          second set and faced a pair of set points while down 6-5 in the third. But he erased each of those
                          point-from-the-set opportunities for Ruud with the sorts of quick-reflex, soft-hand volleys he
                          repeatedly displayed. And with help from a series of shanked shots by a tight-looking Ruud in the
                          ensuing tiebreaker, Alcaraz surged to the end of that set. One break in the fourth was all it took
                          for Alcaraz to seal the victory in the only Grand Slam final between two players seeking both a
                          first major championship and the top spot in the ATP's computerized rankings, which date to 1973.
                          Ruud is a 23-year-old from Norway who is now 0-2 in Slam finals. He was the runner-up to Rafael
                          Nadal at the French Open in June. Ruud stood way back near the wall to return serve, but also
                          during the course of points, much more so than Alcaraz, who attacked when he could. Alcaraz went
                          after Ruud's weaker side, the backhand, and found success that way, especially while serving. If
                          nothing else, Ruud gets the sportsmanship award for conceding a point he knew he didn't deserve.

                          Carlos Alcaraz defeated Casper Ruud in the final, 6–4, 2–6, 7–6(7–1), 6–3 to win the men's singles
                          tennis title at the 2022 US Open. It was his first major title, and he claimed the world No. 1
                          singles ranking with the win.[1] Ruud, Rafael Nadal, Daniil Medvedev, and Stefanos Tsitsipas were
                          also in contention for the top position.[2] Alcaraz saved a match point en route to the title, in
                          the quarterfinals against Jannik Sinner.[3] Alcaraz became the youngest major champion since Nadal
                          at the 2005 French Open, the youngest US Open champion since Pete Sampras in 1990, the first man
                          born in the 2000s to win a major singles title, and the youngest man to be ranked world No. 1 in
                          tennis history, surpassing the record Lleyton Hewitt held.[4] Alcaraz also became the third player
                          to reach a major final having won three consecutive five-set matches, after Stefan Edberg at the
                          1992 US Open and Andre Agassi at the 2005 US Open.[5] At 23 hours and 39 minutes of play duration
                          across his seven matches, Alcaraz spent the longest time on court in major history.

Question 68              : Who is the new head coach of the Virginia Tech football team in 2022?

                          That’s a battle that neither side is likely to win, nor compromise on, either. Look, no one is
                          fooling anyone. If someone said upon the prior regime departing, that Brent Pry was going to be the
                          head coach of the 2022 and beyond (however long “beyond is”) Virginia Tech Hokies football program,
                          you’d have been laughed out of the room. Who? For Defensive Coordinator, maybe? And why would he
                          take that demotion? The reality (again we return to “reality”) is that only two or three coaches on
                          this staff have experience at the levels at which they are performing; JC Price and Joe Rudolph are
                          performing parallel jobs. Everyone else is subject to the “Peter Principle”. I don’t normally sight
                          Wikipedia but this works fine. That includes the Head Coach, the Offensive Coordinator, the
                          Defensive Coordinator, and the Special Teams Coach. Well, gee isn’t that really everyone who
                          counts. That’s an affirmative. Another “reality” is called for, here. Whit Babcock is taking a very
                          calculated risk. He did the “safe” and expected thing before and was burned. This time he’s gone
                          ahead and dived into the tank headfirst without testing the water. At mid-season of the first year,
                          it’s not expected that very much will be done until after December, but there are indications that
                          some of the subjects are perilously close to the operational disaster outlined in the definition of
                          the “Peter Principle”.

                          I’ve long been a fan of this metric, which evaluates how much greater of a share the #1 cigar got
                          compared to the #25. This looks at the same metric but comparing the #1 and #2 shares. If anything,
                          this really reinforces that the 2021 winner—Undercrown 10—really captured itself as a consensus in
                          a manner that hasn’t been true for the other four years. By every metric (number of lists, number
                          of publications, number of points awarded), this is the second smallest pool of data that The
                          Consensus has drawn from in the last five years. In short, there were fewer lists. A lot fewer. In
                          direct comparison to 2021, here’s the shrinkage: There are a lot of variables that make declaring a
                          proper rate of decline somewhat difficult, but it is a noticeable drop in the number of lists being
                          used. The largest cause of this is certainly YouTube’s 2022 policy changes with regard to channels
                          that videos about tobacco products. Following a series of strikes—YouTube’s way of saying “you did
                          something wrong”—content creators like Cigar Obsession and others voluntarily and involuntarily
                          have found themselves no longer publishing on YouTube. While Bryan Glynn was never one for Top 10
                          cigar lists—and as such, I don’t believe has ever been part of The Consensus—YouTube has been the
                          main source of growth regarding The Consensus’ pool of data.

                          The 2022 Kentucky Derby (officially, the 148th Running of the Kentucky Derby Presented by Woodford
                          Reserve[1]) took place on Saturday, May 7, 2022, at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky. It was
                          the 148th running of the Kentucky Derby, a 1+1⁄4 miles (2.0 km) Grade I stakes race for
                          three-year-old Thoroughbreds. The Derby is held annually at Churchill Downs on the first Saturday
                          in May since its inception in 1875. The 20 horses that ran in the Derby qualified by earning points
                          in the 2022 Road to the Kentucky Derby. The two favorites for the 2022 Kentucky Derby were
                          Epicenter, the winner of the Louisiana Derby, and Zandon, the winner of the Blue Grass Stakes. Both
                          horses finished behind winner Rich Strike, who had only entered the race after a late scratch.
                          Entering the race at odds of 80–1, Rich Strike's victory was the second-largest upset in Derby
                          history. It was the first Kentucky Derby victory for his trainer Eric Reed, as well as the first
                          graded stakes win in any race for his jockey Sonny Leon. Participation in the Kentucky Derby is
                          restricted to three-year-old Thoroughbreds.

                          The initial months of 2021 were not favorable for automakers. Semiconductor shortages derailed the
                          post-COVID recovery, affecting vehicle sales worldwide. But the shortages have eased a bit one year
                          later and auto sales are reviving. Automakers expect to recover the losses made during the last two
                          years, soon. However, traditional automakers are unable to cope with the rising demand for pure
                          EVs, whereas Tesla’s ability to address this demand has rewarded it not only with higher vehicle
                          sales in Q1 2022 but also a record revenue of $18.8 billion. Tesla has also started deliveries to
                          car rental service provider Hertz against its huge 100,000-vehicle order, which is also a reason
                          for high vehicle production and delivery during the quarter. Tesla’s Q1 2022 revenue would have
                          been more without the fresh COVID wave that has hit Shanghai and surrounding areas, affecting the
                          company’s production there. From the second week of March, rising cases of a new COVID variant have
                          forced automakers operating around Shanghai to suspend production. The urge to achieve L4 autonomy
                          by the end of 2023 and to roll out robotaxis by early 2025 can be a major reason for Tesla’s big
                          R&D spend. Besides, Tesla could also be conducting research on developing new battery chemistry.
                          The soaring prices of some key battery components like nickel and lithium have put the auto OEMs in
                          a spot.

                          means that UK fans will be able to play the game as the clock strikes 12 tonight (or 00:00am BST if
                          you want to get technical about it), at the very moment that Friday begins. There may not be much

                          STX Entertainment is an American entertainment and media company. Founded in March 2014 by film
                          producer Robert Simonds, the studio produces film, television, and digital media projects. In April
                          2020, STX announced that it would merge with the Indian studio Eros International plc. The merger
                          was completed in July 2020, and STX became a division of ErosSTX. In December 2021, Jahm Najafi
                          announced his intention to acquire STX from the merged company for $173 million–a sale completed in
                          April 2022. Eros remains a minority, non-voting shareholder.[1] In 2012, Simonds and McGlashan
                          began work on conceptualizing a media company based on the idea of producing medium-budget projects
                          with a star attached, a method that had gone out of style with Hollywood studios. The conversation
                          led to the launch of STX Entertainment in 2014, with the mission to finance, develop, produce,
                          market, and distribute star-driven content around the world.[2][3] Investors in the company
                          included Hony Capital, Tencent, PCCW, TPG Growth, and Liberty Global. Individual investors include
                          Gigi Pritzker, Beau Wrigley, and Dominic Ng.[4][5][6] In September 2017, it was reported that STX
                          was considering an initial public offering on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (SEHK).

                          Orrin Grant Hatch (March 22, 1934 – April 23, 2022) was an American attorney and politician who
                          served as a United States senator from Utah from 1977 to 2019. Hatch's 42-year Senate tenure made
                          him the longest-serving Republican U.S. senator in history, overtaking Ted Stevens, until Chuck
                          Grassley surpassed him in 2023. Hatch chaired the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and
                          Pensions from 1981 to 1987. He served as chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee from 1995 to 2001
                          and 2003 to 2005. On January 3, 2015, after the 114th United States Congress was sworn in, he
                          became president pro tempore of the Senate. He was chair of the Senate Finance Committee from 2015
                          to 2019, and led efforts to pass the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Orrin Grant Hatch was born in
                          Homestead, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Pittsburgh.[1][2] He was the son of Jesse Hatch (1904–1992), a
                          metal lather,[3] and his wife Helen Frances Hatch (née Kamm; 1906–1995). Hatch had eight brothers

                          as the longest-serving Republican in the chamber’s history and one of his party’s most influential
                          lawmakers of recent decades, died April 23 in Salt Lake City. He was 88. The death was announced by
                          the Hatch Foundation. The cause was not immediately disclosed. Tall and slim in build and
                          impeccable in dress, Mr. Hatch had a gentlemanly demeanor but behind it wielded strong views, high
                          energy and a love for legislative give-and-take that made him a force on Capitol Hill. When he

  - Source              :
                          The final death knell was a devastating 15,000-word profile in The Atlantic that published on
                          Friday. The blistering piece, in which author Tim Alberta spoke to more than 100 CNN employees,
                          called into serious question Licht’s ability to lead the organization into the future. In the wake
                          of The Atlantic article, Licht attempted to regain his footing. He apologized to staffers and vowed
                          to “fight like hell” to win over the trust of employees. But it became increasingly clear that
                          Licht’s tenure as the chief executive was not tenable and quickly coming to an end. High-profile
                          anchors and correspondents, in addition the the rank-and-file staff, had hit the wall with Licht.
                          The CNN chief had, in effect, lost the room. The picture quickly became clear to Zaslav, who
                          installed his top lieutenant, David Leavy, as CNN’s chief operating officer last week. Over the
                          weekend, after The Atlantic story crystallized concerns that Zaslav had with Licht’s leadership
                          over the last several months, the Warner Bros. Discovery chief started seriously considering
                          relieving him of his duties, a person familiar with the matter said. It had become evident that
                          Licht, suffering from a series of self-inflicted wounds, could no longer lead the company. The
                          final decision to remove Licht was ultimately made by Zaslav earlier this week, the person said.

                          “We have a lot to do and the war in Ukraine reminds us that we are going through tragic times where
                          France must make its voice heard,” Macron said. During her campaign, Le Pen pledged to dilute
                          French ties with the 27-nation EU, NATO and Germany, moves that would have shaken Europe’s security
                          architecture as the continent deals with its worst conflict since World War II. Le Pen also spoke
                          against EU sanctions on Russian energy supplies and faced scrutiny during the campaign over her
                          previous friendliness with the Kremlin. A chorus of European leaders hailed Macron’s victory, since
                          France has played a leading role in international efforts to punish Russia with sanctions and is
                          supplying weapons to Ukraine. “Democracy wins, Europe wins,” said Spanish Prime Minister Pedro
                          Sánchez. “Together we will make France and Europe advance,” tweeted European Commission President
                          Ursula von der Leyen. Italian Premier Mario Draghi called Macron’s victory “splendid news for all
                          of Europe” and a boost to the EU “being a protagonist in the greatest challenges of our times,
                          starting with the war in Ukraine.” Macron won with 58.5% of the vote to Le Pen’s 41.5% —
                          significantly closer than when they first faced off in 2017. Macron is the first French president
                          in 20 years to win reelection, since incumbent Jacques Chirac trounced Le Pen’s father in 2002.

Question 77              : What is the megapixel in main camera on the iPhone 14 Pro?

                          I ended up with hundreds of photos and dozens of video clips on the 1TB iPhone 14 Pro review sample
                          that Apple had lent me. The iPhone 14 Pro has three rear cameras: a main wide-angle camera, an
                          ultrawide and a telephoto camera with 3x optical zoom. The lens on the main camera has a wider
                          focal length, going from a 26mm equivalent on previous iPhone models to a 24mm one. It isn't
                          drastically different, but it helps get more of the scene into the frame. Just a cat under mixed
                          lighting, as captured by the iPhone 14 Pro. The main camera also gets a new, larger, 48-megapixel
                          sensor. Though more megapixels doesn't necessarily mean better photos, Apple divides the pixels
                          into groups of four and combines the four in each group into one larger pixel. This technique is
                          called pixel binning, and it's been used on Android phones for years. The results are brighter
                          photos that have less image noise (and as a bonus, less noise-reduction blur). Apple's new
                          imagining pipeline, called the Photonic Engine, takes things further and helps improve color
                          accuracy and protect details. Take a look below at a photo I shot of a streetcar just after sunset.
                          Pay special attention to the texture of the pavement and the details in the leaves and building
                          behind the streetcar.

                          Taiyab said he applauded Apple for trying to empower iPhone owners but had a harsh verdict. “They
                          set up the customer to fail,” he said. The self-repair program, I concluded, is impractical for
                          most people. For starters, the cost of renting the equipment and purchasing parts from Apple — $96
                          to replace my iPhone 12’s battery — was more than the $69 an Apple store charges to do the job. And
                          as my experience shows, the process was challenging even with Apple’s tools. Apple discourages most
                          people from trying self-repair. “For the vast majority of customers, the safest and most reliable
                          repair is achieved through an Apple Store” and thousands of authorized repair centers, the company
                          said in a white paper last month. “Repairing modern electronic devices that are complex, highly
                          integrated and miniaturized isn’t easy.” This raises the question of why Apple rolled out the
                          self-repair program in the first place. It is probably no coincidence that it made the move after
                          the Federal Trade Commission said last year that it would ramp up enforcement against tech
                          companies that made it hard for people to fix their electronics. And now, my tale of defeat. I
                          started by visiting Apple’s self-repair program website, selfservicerepair.com. There I found the
                          service manual for the iPhone 12 I wanted to repair and ordered the tools. (Apple’s program
                          currently includes manuals for iPhones released in the last two years.

                          Nets. The Lakers have the easiest road to reaching the Finals because of bad injury luck to teams
                          like the Clippers and Nuggets. The Nets will, by season’s end, be the most talented team in the
                          East and will therefore vanquish all challengers come playoff time. Mahoney: Brooklyn outlasts an
                          improved, more streamlined Milwaukee team to make it out of the East, in part because Irving took
                          leave from his post as a voice for the voiceless, got his shots, and joined the team midseason. The
                          absolute chaos of the West winds up working in the favor of the steadiest team in the conference:
                          the Phoenix Suns, who play with a similar polish but more pop owed to the further development of
                          their young core. Murdock: Lakers-Nets. Assuming everyone’s healthy, these are the two best teams
                          in the league. And, more importantly, it’s what everyone wants. Make it happen, NBA. Verrier: Nets
                          and Lakers. The 2021 Finals was the first without either KD or LeBron in a decade. I wouldn’t bet
                          on that happening again this year. Check your inbox for a welcome email. Oops. Something went

Question 83              : When was Overwatch 2 released?

                          16] At least three new heroes were announced to be added to the roster, including Sojourn, a
                          Canadian Overwatch officer, Junker Queen, the ruler of Junkertown, and Kiriko, the protector of
                          Kanezaka.[17][18] Overwatch 2 runs on an upgraded version of the original game's engine which
                          allows for larger map sizes to better support the new story-based player versus environment (PvE)
                          elements.[12] Additionally, all of the existing heroes received visual redesigns for Overwatch 2,
                          although Blizzard did not expect every hero to have their redesigns finished when the game
                          launched. Twelve of the existing 31 redesigns were completed at the time of Overwatch 2's
                          reveal.[17] Overwatch 2 was released for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows,
                          Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S in early access on October 4, 2022.[18] Kaplan stated when the game
                          was announced that they were more concerned about quality of the product than timeliness of the
                          release.[19][20] Investor documents released in November 2021 reported that the initial 2022
                          release window was delayed to at least 2023, intended for "giving the teams some extra time to
                          complete production and continue growing their creative resources to support the titles after
                          launch".[21] Kaplan anticipated that Overwatch and Overwatch 2 will ultimately merge into a single
                          product to avoid having any engine differences affecting player experience.

                          Tadej Pogacar. It was the 26-year-old's second Tour de France, after only three years of being a
                          professional cyclist at the top level — UCIWorld. Vingegaard snatched the yellow jersey off Pogacar
                          after the stage 11 summit finish at Col du Granon, winning the race and gaining three minutes on
                          his rival. Pogacar attacked Vingegaard twice on Alpe d'Huez during stage 12 but the Dane managed to
                          fight them off and finish with the same time as his challenger.

Question 85              : How much was Apple's revenue in Q3? 2022
Correct Answers         :  
                          83 billion, 83.0 billion
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prediction (only positive):

  - Source              :
                          Apple today announced financial results for its third fiscal quarter of 2022, which corresponds to
                          the second calendar quarter of the year. For the quarter, Apple posted revenue of $83 billion and
                          net quarterly profit of $19.4 billion, or $1.20 per diluted share, compared to revenue of $81.4
                          billion and net quarterly profit of $21.7 billion, or $1.30 per diluted share, in the year-ago
                          quarter. Gross margin for the quarter was 43.3 percent, according to Apple CFO Luca Maestri. Apple
                          also declared a quarterly dividend payment of $0.23 per share, payable on August 11 to shareholders
                          of record as of August 8. iPhone and Services revenue achieved June quarter records, while Mac,
                          iPad, and "Wearables, Home, and Accessories" revenue was down. A category-by-category breakdown of
                          Apple's Q3 2022 revenue is outlined below. Apple CEO Tim Cook: This quarter's record results speak
                          to Apple's constant efforts to innovate, to advance new possibilities, and to enrich the lives of
                          our customers. As always, we are leading with our values, and expressing them in everything we

                          been the case for over two years now, Apple is once again not issuing guidance for the current
                          quarter ending in September.

                          Amazon said its cloud-computing division Amazon Web Services (AWS) posted 33 percent increase in
                          its revenue to $19.7 billion in the second quarter of 2022. AWS has generated operating income of
                          $5.71 billion in Q2. Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky said on an analyst call that a downturn in 2008
                          resulted in companies choosing to use Amazon’s cloud services rather than build their own data
                          centers, giving AWS a boost. Rival Microsoft said earlier this week that its fiscal-year revenue
                          would jump on demand for its cloud services. Log in to leave a comment Hey there! Be sure to

                          The Xenoblade Chronicles 3 release date was on July 29, meaning the game is out now. That’s right,
                          go check it out! The story itself is new, and it “ties together the futures of the worlds depicted
                          in Xenoblade Chronicles and Xenoblade Chronicles 2.” There are two warring factions in the world of
                          Aionios – Keves and Agnus. The former is responsible for mechanical technology, while the latter
                          prefers magical tech. You can learn more in our Xenoblade Chronicles 3 colonies guide. When in
                          combat, you can battle with up to seven characters, and, much like in previous Xenoblade games, you
                          must directly face an enemy out in the field to engage in a fight. Naturally, each character brings
                          their own strengths to the battlefield, and this allows you to use a range of strategies. There is
                          also a new mechanic called interlinking, which you can learn more about in our Xenoblade Chronicles
                          3 Ouroboros guide. Furthermore, each character falls under a different class, and this only adds to

                          Xenoblade Chronicles 3[b] is a 2022 action role-playing game developed by Monolith Soft and
                          published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch. It is an installment in the open-world Xenoblade
                          Chronicles series, itself a part of the larger Xeno franchise. Xenoblade Chronicles 3 depicts the
                          futures of the worlds featured in Xenoblade Chronicles (2010) and Xenoblade Chronicles 2 (2017) and
                          concludes the trilogy's narrative. The development team wanted to develop a story-driven game in
                          the style of the first two entries in the series, while featuring content and combat from previous
                          Xeno entries. The gameplay combines elements from the first and second entries. Like the first two
                          entries, the game was localized by Nintendo of Europe. Xenoblade Chronicles 3 takes place in
                          Aionios, where two warring nations, Keves and Agnus, engage in perpetual war fought by soldiers
                          with ten-year lifespans. The story follows Noah and his two childhood friends, Eunie and Lanz, who
                          are from Keves, and Mio and her two fellow servicemen, Sena and Taion, who are from Agnus. They
                          gain the power of Ouroboros and decide to cooperate to find safety. Through this journey, they
                          uncover the mystery behind the perpetual war and the true nature of their world.

                          By then, he had access to a new process, dry-plate photography, that was more sensitive to light
                          and detail. At Penn, he undertook what he described as a “more systematic and comprehensive
                          investigation,” photographing a wide variety of animals and men and women of all shapes and sizes,
                          often in the nude. The goal was to see the body in motion, after all. There were even “horses with
                          naked riders, male and female,” as the narrator notes in “Eadweard Muybridge, Zoopraxographer”
                          (1975), an early documentary from Thom Andersen (“Los Angeles Plays Itself”) that is essential
                          viewing for anyone who wants to learn more about the scope of Muybridge’s ambitions and to see his
                          photographs brought to life. (The film is streaming on Mubi.) The rider featured in “Nope” happens
                          to be clothed, and a published version of those images indicates that the photographs were meant to
                          illustrate a gallop. The caption information says the horse was a thoroughbred mare named Annie. It
                          also indicates various times and measurements related to her stride. But the name of the rider is
                          not mentioned. According to Andersen’s film, that is typical: While Muybridge’s catalog “gives the
                          names of all the horses, mules and dogs,” the voice-over says, Muybridge generally “identifies his
                          human models only by number.

Question 91              : Who is the lead actor in the film Carter?
Correct Answers         :  
                          Joo Won
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prediction (only positive):
  - Answer              : Joo Won

  - Source              :
                          Here's a guide to that cast and characters they play in Carter, and what they've been in before.
                          Heading up the cast is Joo Won as Carter Lee, later revealed as also going by the name Michael
                          Bane. The film begins with Carter waking up in a blood-soaked bed in Seoul with a cross-shaped scar
                          on the back of his head and no memory of who he is. With a premise similar to Hardcore Henry,
                          Carter also features video game logic in its action sequences. Joo Won is a South Korean actor best
                          known for his roles in television, including the main protagonist in Good Doctor, which is played
                          by Freddie Highmore in the American adaptation. Kim Jong-hyeok is a North Korean General who meets
                          Carter during his mission, providing him transport out of South Korea. General Kim is played by Lee
                          Sung-jae, a veteran South Korean actor with credits in TV and film. Lee’s most notable credit is
                          Barking Dogs Never Bite, a 2000 dark comedy film that was the directorial debut of Bong Joon-ho,
                          whose film Parasite won the 2020 Oscar for Best Picture. The young girl cured of the virus and
                          carrying the life-saving antibodies is Jung Ha-na (Kim Bo-min). Carter is tasked with rescuing
                          Ha-na and bringing her to a North Korean facility where the production of a vaccine can be
                          developed.

                          August 5. The conversational AI is designed to converse with humans about “nearly any topic.” Like

                          seems like Blender Bot 3 cannot differentiate between what is acceptable and what is not. At least
                          that’s what its recent responses to some people conveyed.

                          Meta's new prototype chatbot has told the BBC that Mark Zuckerberg exploits its users for money.
                          Meta says the chatbot uses artificial intelligence and can chat on "nearly any topic". Asked what
                          the chatbot thought of the company's CEO and founder, it replied "our country is divided and he
                          didn't help that at all". Meta said the chatbot was a prototype and might produce rude or offensive
                          answers. "Everyone who uses Blender Bot is required to acknowledge they understand it's for
                          research and entertainment purposes only, that it can make untrue or offensive statements, and that
                          they agree to not intentionally trigger the bot to make offensive statements," said a Meta
                          spokesperson. The chatbot, called BlenderBot 3, was released to the public on Friday. The programme
                          "learns" from large amounts of publicly available language data. When asked about Mark Zuckerberg,
                          the chatbot told the BBC: "He did a terrible job at testifying before congress. It makes me
                          concerned about our country." Mr Zuckerberg has been questioned several times by US politicians,
                          most notably in 2018. "Our country is divided, and he didn't help with that at all," the chatbot
                          continued. "His company exploits people for money and he doesn't care. It needs to stop!" it said.
                          Meta has been criticised for not doing enough to prevent disinformation and hate speech being

                          November 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use. Both the free version of ChatGPT and
                          the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model is GPT-4.
                          There is a free version of ChatGPT that only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version,
                          ChatGPT Plus. Anyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies and search engines are utilizing
                          the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questions/concerns. Multiple enterprises
                          utilize ChatGPT, although others may limit the use of the AI-powered tool. Most recently, Microsoft
                          announced at it’s 2023 Build conference that it is integrating it ChatGPT-based Bing experience
                          into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startup Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT to produce

                          Rich visuals mean pictures for now, but later can include maps, charts and other items. ChatGPT’s
                          generative AI has had a longer lifespan and thus has been “learning” for a longer period of time
                          than Bard. A chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn’t
                          necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the
                          sense that they’ll give canned responses to questions. ChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM
                          technology to generate text after a prompt. Yes. Due to the nature of how these models work, they
                          don’t know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That’s a problem when you’re
                          using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn’t commit, that may
                          well at this point be libel. We will see how handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT will
                          play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving
                          target in the industry. Yes, there is now a free ChatGPT app that is currently limited to U.S. iOS

                          ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations

                          OpenAI, and the fourth in its numbered "GPT-n" series of GPT foundation models.[1] It was released
                          on March 14, 2023, and has been made publicly available in a limited form via the chatbot product
                          ChatGPT Plus (a premium version of ChatGPT), and with access to the GPT-4 based version of OpenAI's
                          API being provided via a waitlist.[1] As a transformer based model, GPT-4 was pretrained to predict
                          the next token (using both public data and "data licensed from third-party providers"), and was
                          then fine-tuned with reinforcement learning from human and AI feedback for human alignment and
                          policy compliance.[2]: 2 Observers reported the GPT-4 based version of ChatGPT to be an improvement
                          on the previous (GPT-3.5 based) ChatGPT, with the caveat that GPT-4 retains some of the same
                          problems.[3] Unlike the predecessors, GPT-4 can take images as well as text as input.[4] OpenAI has
                          declined to reveal technical information such as the size of the GPT-4 model.[5] OpenAI introduced
                          the first GPT model (GPT-1) in 2018, publishing a paper called "Improving Language Understanding by

                          version is not available just yet, but you can sign up for the OpenAI waitlist or subscribe to Chat
                          GPT Plus to gain access to the bot. GPT-4 was officially released this week. OpenAI has confirmed
                          the new model in a news post on its website. At the moment, the model is only available via Chat
                          GPT for Chat GPT Plus members. Although, if you are hoping to use the model for free, GPT-4 will
                          also come available on the OpenAI Playground in the next coming weeks.

                          Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4) is a multimodal large language model created by
                          OpenAI, and the fourth in its numbered "GPT-n" series of GPT foundation models.[1] It was released
                          on March 14, 2023, and has been made publicly available in a limited form via the chatbot product
                          ChatGPT Plus (a premium version of ChatGPT), and with access to the GPT-4 based version of OpenAI's
                          API being provided via a waitlist.[1] As a transformer based model, GPT-4 was pretrained to predict
                          the next token (using both public data and "data licensed from third-party providers"), and was
                          then fine-tuned with reinforcement learning from human and AI feedback for human alignment and
                          policy compliance.[2]: 2 Observers reported the GPT-4 based version of ChatGPT to be an improvement
                          on the previous (GPT-3.5 based) ChatGPT, with the caveat that GPT-4 retains some of the same
                          problems.[3] Unlike the predecessors, GPT-4 can take images as well as text as input.[4] OpenAI has
                          declined to reveal technical information such as the size of the GPT-4 model.[5] OpenAI introduced
                          the first GPT model (GPT-1) in 2018, publishing a paper called "Improving Language Understanding by

                          Windows 11 version 22H2 (2022 Update) is the next major refresh of the Microsoft desktop operating
                          system. Codenamed “Sun Valley 2,” the feature update will continue updating the desktop interface,
                          bringing back previously removed features, and introducing new features and improvements. Although
                          we are still days away from the release date, Microsoft is done adding the new features and changes
                          for the Windows 11 2022 Update. The intended final version of the update is already available in
                          the Release Preview Channel of the Windows Insider Program. This release will include new features
                          like Live Captions and Voice Access. It will also introduce an updated version of File Explorer
                          that brings support for tabs and a redesigned navigation pane, a new way to snap applications on
                          the screen with drag and drop Snap layouts flyout, and redesigned version of Task Manager.
                          Furthermore, you will find many visual updates for legacy elements and more. The final version of
                          Windows 11 22H2 has been available since June 7, 2022, but only as a preview in the Release Preview
                          Channel. The feature update is expected to launch on Tuesday, September 20, 2022 (the update is now
                          live for everyone). The update will be offered as a free upgrade for computers already running the
                          original version.

                          By Susan Bradley, Contributing Writer, Computerworld | Windows 11 22H2, released two weeks ago, is
                          another step closer to being an acceptable upgrade to Windows 10. But many Windows users aren't yet
                          being offered it for download. It's important to understand that we're in the “seeker” era for
                          Windows 11 22H2. Microsoft still has a variety of hardware and third-party issues to work through,
                          which is why you might not get offered 22H2 right away. But there is a mechanism you can use to
                          review any hard blocks on your system. (If you want to get 22H2 sooner rather than later, you could
                          opt into the Insider release track, which ensures you get the beta versions of Windows 11 — but
                          that also exposes your hardware to possible bugs, side effects, and other issues.) Courtesy of Adam
                          Gross, you can use a GitHub script to determine exactly why your system is not being offered 22H2.
                          You can either download the PowerShell script from the Github site or follow these commands to
                          determine what might be blocking Windows 11 22H@ from showing up on your hardware.. First, search
                          for PowerShell and then right-mouse click and run as administrator. In an administrator PowerShell
                          session, type in the following: Install-Module FU.

                          for the Windows 11 2022 Update. The intended final version of the update is already available in

                          like Live Captions and Voice Access. It will also introduce an updated version of File Explorer
                          that brings support for tabs and a redesigned navigation pane, a new way to snap applications on
                          the screen with drag and drop Snap layouts flyout, and redesigned version of Task Manager.
                          Furthermore, you will find many visual updates for legacy elements and more. The final version of
                          Windows 11 22H2 has been available since June 7, 2022, but only as a preview in the Release Preview
                          Channel. The feature update is expected to launch on Tuesday, September 20, 2022 (the update is now
                          live for everyone). The update will be offered as a free upgrade for computers already running the
                          original version.

Question 99              : When did AMD unveil Ryzen 7000 processors?
Correct Answers         :

                          You won't have to wait much longer to learn more about AMD's Ryzen 7000 desktop processors. The
                          company has announced that it will unveil the new CPU line in a YouTube livestream on August 29th
                          at 7PM. The event will share more about the new Zen 4 architecture and the supporting AM5 platform.
                          There are already some clues as to what to expect. AMD inadvertently shared some of the first Ryzen
                          7000 model numbers on its website in July, including one Ryzen 5 chip (7600X), one Ryzen 7 variant
                          (7700X) and two Ryzen 9 releases (7900X and 7950X). As with past launches, the company appears
                          focused on gaming-friendly enthusiast CPUs while leaving budget parts for later releases. Zen 4 and
                          AM5, meanwhile, promise meaningful architectural changes. You'll see more Level 2 cache, boost
                          speeds beyond 5GHz, AI hardware acceleration and support for newer standards like DDR5 memory and
                          PCIe 5.0 expansion. AMD claimed a 15 percent boost to single-threaded performance in early testing.
                          Effectively, AMD is responding to Intel's 12th-gen Core — it's just a question of whether or not
                          Ryzen 7000 is fast enough to keep up or edge ahead.

                          described, AMD’s new Ryzen 7000 processors are more straightforward, and they’ll all be available
                          on Sept. 27. Here’s how fast the Ryzen 7000 family will be, and how much the Ryzen 7000 chips will
                          cost: These chips do not have an integrated graphics core, but they do contain some very basic
                          “GPU-like” functions for driving the display. (If AMD still plans full-fledged “APUs” with
                          integrated graphics, they’ll come later.) AMD Su ascribed the performance improvements in part to
                          the move to a 5nm process node, but also a new front-end architecture and support for AVX-512, a
                          set of instructions used for high-performance computing that Intel adopted in 2020. AVX-512 hasn’t
                          been a hit with some users such as Linux creator Linux Torvalds, who wrote that he hoped it would
                          die a “painful death.” But what are those performance improvements? As every chip manufacturer
                          does, AMD picked a few benchmarks to show the new Ryzen 7000 processors in a favorable light. But
                          it also aggregated them together, demonstrating that, across the board, the Ryzen 7000 handily
                          outperforms its own Ryzen 5000 processors as well as the rival Alder Lake. And not just a
                          head-to-head battle, either.

                          There was some serious Black Girl Magic on display at the 2022 United States Gymnastics
                          Championships. According to ESPN, Konnor McClain delivered a strong two-day performance to win
                          all-around gold at the national championships. She was joined on the podium by silver medalist
                          Shilese Jones and bronze medalist Jordan Chiles. Yes, the top three women’s gymnasts in the country
                          are all Black. It was a very tight competition that saw first place and third place separated by
                          only eight-tenths of a point. McClain was expected to be a part of the 2020 Olympic team, but a
                          rough season combined with injuries led her to abruptly switch coaches—which is a decision not
                          normally made during an Olympic cycle. Now, a year later, that change has clearly paid off. The bad
                          news for the rest of the world is that the champion says she’s only at 75 percent, as she’s still
                          recovering from a recent concussion and is dealing with stress fractures in both shins. McClain
                          thinks she’ll be completely ready for the world championships later this year in England. “Anything
                          can happen,’’ she said. “So I’m excited for the future.’’ After the first day of competition,
                          McClain was a close second behind Jones, but a strong opening vault put her ahead of Jones, who
                          fell off the balance beam. Though the gold medalist stayed in front the rest of the night, things
                          ultimately came down to the final rotation.

                          to close out the OOFOS U.S. Gymnastics Championships, no one’s quite sure what to expect. It’s been
                          a while. In recent history, a 4-foot-8 cloud has cast a shadow over the competition. As long as
                          Simone Biles was competing — and her peers readily admitted this — everyone else knew they were
                          going for second place. At least in the all-around. But really, Biles’ combination of difficulty
                          and execution was so high that she was all but a lock to win vault, and in most years floor and
                          beam, too. Heck, she even won a national title on bars in 2018. With the most decorated gymnast of
                          all time having stepped away from the sport following the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020, the 20 women

                          House of the Dragon premieres Aug. 21 on HBO. It’s been three years since Game Of Thrones ended,
                          and five years since its fandom started complaining bitterly about its final seasons. Spin-off
                          House Of The Dragon therefore debuts to less hype than it might have once had, but really could
                          restore our fascination with Westeros. Immediately, its premiere boasts everything that Thrones did
                          well: an overqualified cast of character actors; backstabbing; sexposition; and lots of dragons.
                          The first proposed spin-off to Game Of Thrones – a Naomi Watts-led adventure set in Westeros’
                          distant past – was ultimately scrapped, reportedly because it was too different from the original
                          show. Perhaps as a result, it sometimes feels like there’s an element of overcorrection here. It’s
                          beautifully rendered - the budget is clearly late-season Game Of Thrones rather than Season 1, and
                          both the Cornish and Spanish locations and the computer-generated dragon flights look magical - but
                          looks and sounds awfully close to its progenitor, down to iconography and locations. That’s not
                          necessarily a bad thing when it comes to the storytelling, since it’s set just far enough in
                          Westeros’ past to keep us guessing, but it speaks of a pervasive timidity in Hollywood to take even
                          the most minor of risks. Still, that’s admittedly more a criticism of this show’s context than its
                          content. Showrunners Ryan J.

                          Discovery CEO David Zaslav looks to trim down content on the service. Zaslav has doubled down on
                          cost-cutting measures, killing off 40 or so shows and shelving “Batgirl,” leaving many subscribers
                          worried about what content will be left when the company merges the streaming services HBO Max and
                          Discovery+ next year. Most recently, HBO Max took down 200 “Sesame Street” episodes (not cool,
                          David). The newly merged company also laid off 70 employees from HBO and HBO Max. HBO Max and its
                          notoriously buggy app ran into issues on Sunday, with subscribers complaining about the app
                          crashing, mainly on Amazon Fire TV devices. Twitter was flooded with people reporting the HBO Max
                          app crashes. Amazon told Deadline that the issue is now resolved. “House of Dragon” will have 10
                          episodes in total, which are released weekly. The finale will premiere on October 23.

                          month or so. This is the bad news: PS VR2 is expensive. The basic bundle – which includes the
                          headset, a pair of controllers, and stereo headphones – costs $549/£529/€599, which is more than
                          the first PS VR headset launched for, and even more than it costs to buy the PS5 now, which is
                          $499/£479/€549. That’s the cheapest way to buy the new VR headset.

                          Analyst Ross Young claimed that the PSVR2 would not be entering the wild until 2023. Young wrote on
                          Twitter that VR display shipments were to rise in 2022 despite delays to 2023 at Sony.

Question 106              : Who is the Heisman Trophy winner in 2022?

                          8 USC may have fallen short of the Pac-12 championship and a spot in the playoff, but it was still
                          a rebirth for a college football blue blood that has had only short spurts of success over the last
                          decade. The last time USC had a Heisman winner was 2005, when running back Reggie Bush was the
                          second of consecutive Trojans players to win the award. Matt Leinart won the Heisman in 2004 on the
                          way to a national championship. Bush’s Heisman win, the Trojans’ seventh, was later vacated for
                          NCAA violations that began the descent of USC. Notre Dame, Ohio State and Oklahoma each have seven
                          Heisman victories. TOP MOMENTS FROM THE NIGHT How the voting played out Here is a look at the final
                          order of the 2022 Heisman Trophy voting. Caleb Williams is your 2022 Heisman Trophy winner. The

                          inviting multiple finalists in 1982. So it only made sense for him to pose with the only player in
                          college football history to win the prestigious award two times: Buckeye legend Archie Griffin.

                          Ewers has more raw talent than 99% of college football quarterbacks, yet he may be in danger of
                          losing his starting job to freshman sensation Arch Manning. Both Manning and Ewing are big names to
                          keep an eye on in the Heisman odds market. Cade Klubnik, the Clemson quarterback, is currently
                          +1400 to win the Heisman Trophy. Klubnik finally took over for DJ Uiagalelei at the end of last
                          season, and Clemson’s offense seemed instantly more cohesive. If Klubnik can return the Clemson
                          offense to its one-time status as a playoff-caliber unit, he will have a firm place in the Heisman
                          discussion. A Klubnik Heisman win would be historic for the Tigers, as no Clemson player – not even
                          Deshaun Watson or Trevor Lawrence – has ever won the Heisman. Drake Maye, the North Carolina
                          quarterback, is currently +1600 to win the Heisman Trophy. Like Sam Howell before him, Maye put up
                          big numbers in Mack Brown’s UNC offense in 2022. As a result, he earned a handful of Heisman votes.
                          North Carolina may have hit its ceiling last year, reaching the ACC championship game before losing
                          to Clemson, 38-10. Maye wasn’t even a Heisman finalist. Given how last year unfolded, it’s fair to
                          wonder what the path to the top spot is for Maye.

                          timeframe. Military brothers Michael and Marcus made quick work of that, nailing it on the second
                          attempt, but others struggled more. Timing is everything in this game, so multiple failed challenge
                          attempts could snowball into eliminations. Up next, the pairs had to saw a log to unlock a clue.
                          The teams deployed different strategies for this. Where some exerted a lot of physical energy,
                          others took a less intense, more careful approach of letting the saw do what it’s made to do.
                          Preserving energy was a good move, as the last challenge required players to chisel through a large
                          block of ice. Kit Karzen/CBS Big Brother alums Derek and Claire (who have been dating since meeting
                          on the show) were the first couple to unlock all three clues, which reveal the next Pit Stop
                          location: Friedensengal, Munich’s Angel of Peace monument. Derek and Claire came in first place,
                          winning them $2,500 each. Newlyweds Glenda and Lumumba placed second, and former Rams cheerleaders
                          Quinton and Mattie placed third. Engaged couple Aastha and Nina came in last, making them the first
                          pair eliminated from The Amazing Race Season 34. The Amazing Race will have a 90-minute episode on
                          September 28, starting at 9:30/8:30c on CBS.

                          with the season kicking off in January 2024 with Woods and McIlroy as the first two golfers
                          committed to compete. Each team will consist of three players. The concept is the brainchild of
                          McCarley, who was President of the Golf Channel and later the NBC Sports Group until he stepped
                          down in March 2021. McCarley formed a new company, NexGen Sports Group, after leaving NBC, but the
                          company will be known as TMRW Sports Group moving forward. While TGL appears to be a response to
                          LIV Golf, McCarley came up with the TGL concept and pitched it to McIlroy prior to leaving NBC.
                          Woods, the strongest brand name in golf, was added later as the third co-founder. “TGL is the next
                          evolution within professional golf, and I am committed to helping lead it into the future,” Woods
                          said in the press release announcing TGL.

                          In 2017, after the success of the 2016 R-rated film Deadpool, Verbinski stated on Reddit that the
                          film might have a chance in this day and age.[8] In 2019, Greg Russo, the writer for the
                          then-upcoming Mortal Kombat, Resident Evil, and Saints Row films, stated that he had a great
                          interest in making a film adaption of the game and had been trying to find the right people to make
                          it happen.[9] On March 3, 2020 the web site wegotthiscovered.com reported that a BioShock film is
                          in development by Universal Pictures. However, they stressed that "in development" does not mean
                          that a film is in current production or will ever go into production.[10] In 2021, it was revealed
                          that actors Eddie Redmayne ("The Danish Girl", "The Theory of Everything", "Fantastic
                          Beasts-series") and Jamie Dornan ("Fifty Shades of Grey", "Once Upon a Time", "Marie Antoinette")
                          auditioned for the film.[11] In February of 2022, Take Two and 2K announced that the film was back
                          in development and would be a Netflix exclusive film.[12] In August of 2022, it was announced that
                          Francis Lawrence would be helming the film as director, and Michael Green would be writing the
                          script.

                          World Cup came to an end Sunday, with Argentina as the victors. Argentina started strong in the
                          final match with a 2-0 lead over France, but France's Kylian Mbappé quickly changed the course of
                          the game with two goals of his own in the second half. With minutes left, Argentina's star player
                          Lionel Messi broke the tie and scored another goal, and it seemed like Argentina once again had
                          sealed their victory — until Mbappé, for only the second time in the history of the World Cup
                          finals, completed a hat trick, scoring a third goal with a late penalty. After a tense penalty
                          shootout, Argentina emerged victorious. Argentina's goalkeeper, Emiliano Martínez, blocked France's
                          second attempt, and French winger Kingsley Coman missed his penalty.

                          the 2022 World Cup final on Sunday, Dec. 18, at the Lusail Stadium in Lusail City, Qatar. The 2022
                          World Cup came to an end Sunday, with Argentina as the victors. Argentina started strong in the
                          final match with a 2-0 lead over France, but France's Kylian Mbappé quickly changed the course of
                          the game with two goals of his own in the second half. With minutes left, Argentina's star player
                          Lionel Messi broke the tie and scored another goal, and it seemed like Argentina once again had
                          sealed their victory — until Mbappé, for only the second time in the history of the World Cup
                          finals, completed a hat trick, scoring a third goal with a late penalty. After a tense penalty
                          shootout, Argentina emerged victorious. Argentina's goalkeeper, Emiliano Martínez, blocked France's
                          second attempt, and French winger Kingsley Coman missed his penalty.

                          women’s basketball coach Marlene Stollings, who was fired in 2020 following a joint investigation
                          by The Intercollegiate and USA Today. The reporting uncovered, through public records requests, a
                          trove of athlete exit interview surveys in the school’s possession, with claims of abuse made
                          against Stollings by at least a dozen athletes over two years. Nevertheless, Texas Tech didn’t so
                          much as suspended the coach until firing her the day after the story was published, though TTU had
                          initiated an internal investigation several months before. In her lawsuit filed against the school
                          and Hocutt, Stollings accused her former boss of terminating her to “deflect blame” after realizing
                          that his “own position was at risk.” While denying the merit of Stollings’ “inflammatory”
                          allegations, Hocutt and the university filed motions to dismiss on account of Texas’ qualified
                          immunity law, which shields public officials from liability “when they are acting within their
                          discretionary authority and their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or
                          constitutional law.” It’s the same regulation that allowed Texas Tech to ward off an employment

                          spring schedule, typically kicking off in February or March and running through May. That wasn’t

                          God, thank you so much. You guys were amazing today. I tried," Williams told the audience, hands on
                          her hips, before mentioning, among others, her parents and her older sister, Venus, a seven-time
                          major champion who is 42. "I wouldn't be Serena if there wasn't Venus. So thank you, Venus,"
                          Williams said. "She's the only reason that Serena Williams ever existed." They started in tennis as
                          kids in Compton, California, coached by their father, Richard, who taught himself about the sport
                          after watching on television while a player received a winner's check. He was the central figure in
                          the Oscar-winning film "King Richard," produced by his daughters. The siblings lost together in the
                          first round of doubles on Thursday night, drawing another sellout.

                          Friday in the southbound lanes just before Exit 1 in Englewood Cliffs. Police said the van shuttled
                          workers back and forth from their homes to a party goods supply factory in upstate New York. Most
                          victims live in Upper Manhattan, where the van was heading. Victims' relatives told CBS2 no one

                          death from a horrific accident. The 21-year-old Canadian influencer, also a University of Toronto
                          philosophy student, died on Aug. 27 from injuries suffered from a skydiving jump, during which her
                          parachute deployed too late. She was laid to rest at a memorial service in Richmond Hill, Ontario
                          on Sept. 2. "What Tanya did during 21 years, I think many people fail to fulfill even in 80 or 90

                          speaker. The newspaper reported that most of the participants wore white as they sat before a white

                          had learned by her 18th birthday, such as, "Don't take yourself so seriously, nothing matters in
                          the grand scheme anyway." Pardazi fell to her death while completing her first solo dive with

                          Robert L. "Mickey" Joseph[1] (born March 5, 1968) is a former American football coach and player.
                          He served as the interim head coach at the University of Nebraska in 2022. Joseph was the associate
                          head coach and wide receivers coach at Louisiana State University (LSU) from 2017 to 2021, and was
                          also head football coach at Langston University in Langston, Oklahoma, from 2011 to 2012. Joseph
                          attended the University of Nebraska–Lincoln, where he played quarterback for the Nebraska
                          Cornhuskers. The native of Marrero, Louisiana, who attended Archbishop Shaw High School started off
                          his career as a capable backup playing behind starters Steve Taylor and Gerry Gdowski for his
                          freshman and sophomore years. He took over the team as the starter in a two-quarterback system with
                          teammate Mike Grant during Joseph's junior year in 1990. As a starter at Nebraska, he led his team
                          to a 9–2 regular season record in his only season as the team's starting signal caller under the
                          direction of head coach Tom Osborne. That season, Joseph got Nebraska off to a perfect 8–0 record
                          as expectations in Lincoln, Nebraska, were building up off a No. 3 ranking from the AP Poll. The
                          next game came on November 3, 1990, as Nebraska faced nationally ranked No. 1 Colorado.

                          for a very long time. Ever since being the runner-up to America’s Got Talent way back in 2011, it’s
                          been her ability at such a young age, to fuse together classily and powerfully, opera and pop into
                          a hybrid genre of operatic pop (a musical genre that someone like Josh Groban would be more
                          familiar and akin to). While Jackie herself isn’t necessarily as popular nowadays compared to when
                          she did wow us on our television screens all those years ago, what Jackie has nevertheless created
                          over the last decade or so, is a musical genre and style that is as underappreciated as it is
                          undervalued, to say the least. Jackie’s music is indeed something that is unique- so different and
                          compelling that we as a site decided to write about her music, impact, and influence– highlighting
                          her original songs, her cover tracks, alongside songs she’s covered not in English as well. On the
                          whole, Jackie’s music has touched millions of people around the world, mine inclusive, as well.

                          Program at the Emmys with Arcane picking up the award at the Creative Arts ceremony. It marks the
                          first time that a streaming show has picked up the award. It beat Bob’s Burgers, Rick and Morty,
                          The Simpsons and Chadwick Boseman-voiced What If…? in the hotly contested category. Other streaming
                          contenders in the past have included Netflix’s Big Mouth and BoJack Horseman. Arcane co-creator
                          Christian Linke picked up the award. “Thank you this. It’s a big deal for us as we come from video
                          games. It’s been amazing to see the world embrace our characters and our stories so thanks to

                          Futurama is a must-watch for anyone who loves sci-fi, comedy, or just good storytelling. Rick and
                          Morty, the critically acclaimed animated sci-fi show from Adult Swim, has taken home not one but
                          two Emmy Awards for Outstanding Animated Program. The show follows the adventures of the cynical
                          and alcoholic scientist Rick and his good-hearted but bumbling grandson Morty as they explore
                          different dimensions and universes. With its offbeat humor, unpredictable storylines, and clever
                          references to pop culture and science, Rick and Morty has captured the hearts of viewers and
                          critics alike. What sets Rick and Morty apart from other animated shows is its unique blend of
                          humor, heart, and thought-provoking ideas. Each episode is a rollercoaster ride of absurdity and
                          emotion, with a perfect balance between dark humor and genuine character development. The animation
                          style is also top-notch, with detailed designs for different creatures and worlds that make the
                          show a visual treat. With its dedicated fanbase and innovative storytelling, it's no wonder that
                          Rick and Morty has won multiple Emmys and continues to be one of the most talked-about shows on
                          television. Related: 10 Best Rick and Morty Episodes for People New to the Show Star Wars: Clone

                          the year 3000, the world is a very different place. This is the world of Futurama, a sci-fi comedy
                          that takes you on a journey through time and space. The show follows the adventures of Fry, a pizza
                          delivery boy who was cryogenically frozen in 1999 and wakes up 1000 years later. He joins the crew

                          dangerous situations. What makes Futurama stand out is its perfect blend of science fiction and
                          comedy. The show's writing is clever, with jokes that will make you laugh and references that will
                          make any sci-fi fan giddy. The animation is also top-notch, with incredible attention to detail and

                          two Emmys for Outstanding Animated Program. The characters are loveable and relatable, with their
                          own unique quirks and personalities.

Question 127              : How many teams will be included in the expanded College Football Playoff?
Correct Answers         :  
                          12
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prediction (only positive):
  - Answer              : 12
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          The CFP announced Thursday it will expand to a 12-team event in two years, completing an 18-month
                          process that was fraught with delays and disagreements. It is a momentous step that will bring in
                          billions of dollars in television revenue and change the very fabric of the postseason. The
                          announcement came a day after the Rose Bowl agreed to amend its contract for the 2024 and 2025
                          seasons, the last hurdle CFP officials needed cleared to triple the size of what is now a four-team
                          format. “I never gave up,” Hancock said. Expansion is expected to produce about $450 million in
                          additional gross revenue for the conferences and schools that participate. The CFP’s current
                          12-year contract with ESPN runs through the 2025-26 season. CFP officials have said they would like
                          to explore having multiple broadcast partners in the next cycle. The idea of major college football
                          holding a playoff dates back decades and the Championship Subdivision has had one since 1978. The
                          late Penn State coach Joe Paterno pined for one in the 1970s. Former Big Eight Commissioner Chuck
                          Nienas proposed one in the late 1980s. The creation of the BCS in the late 1990s was the first step
                          toward a real playoff, Hancock said. “The BCS for the first time gave an opportunity to decide a
                          national champion on the field every year, not just at the whims of the bowl pairings,” Hancock
                          said.

                          The CFP announced Thursday it will expand to a 12-team event in two years, completing an 18-month
                          process that was fraught with delays and disagreements. It is a momentous step that will bring in
                          billions of dollars in television revenue and change the very fabric of the postseason. The
                          announcement came a day after the Rose Bowl agreed to amend its contract for the 2024 and 2025
                          seasons, the last hurdle CFP officials needed cleared to triple the size of what is now a four-team
                          format. “I never gave up,” Hancock said. Expansion is expected to produce about $450 million in
                          additional gross revenue for the conferences and schools that participate. The CFP’s current
                          12-year contract with ESPN runs through the 2025-26 season. CFP officials have said they would like
                          to explore having multiple broadcast partners in the next cycle. The idea of major college football
                          holding a playoff dates back decades and the Championship Subdivision has had one since 1978. The
                          late Penn State coach Joe Paterno pined for one in the 1970s. Former Big Eight Commissioner Chuck
                          Nienas proposed one in the late 1980s. The creation of the BCS in the late 1990s was the first step
                          toward a real playoff, Hancock said. “The BCS for the first time gave an opportunity to decide a
                          national champion on the field every year, not just at the whims of the bowl pairings,” Hancock
                          said.

                          Russia was prohibited from hosting international competitions, and the national team was ordered to
                          play all home matches behind closed doors in neutral countries. Under these sanctions, Russia would
                          not be allowed to compete under the country's name, flag, or national anthem; similarly to the
                          Russian athletes' participation in events such as the Olympics,[412] the team would compete under
                          the abbreviation of their national federation, the Russian Football Union ("RFU"), rather than
                          "Russia".[413] The next day, FIFA decided to suspend Russia from international competitions "until
                          further notice", including its participation in the 2022 FIFA World Cup.[414] There are no LGBT
                          rights in Qatar, with homosexuality as well as campaigning for LGBT rights criminalized. As such,
                          when Qatar was selected to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup, the choice to do so in a restrictive
                          nation saw much criticism, with several topics becoming the subject of controversy. The security of
                          fans,[415] as well as the homophobic football chants of certain nations, were points of
                          discussion.[416] The main controversy came from a last-minute FIFA decision to hand out player
                          punishments to European captains who had months earlier announced their intention to continue
                          wearing rainbow-colored armbands (which began in 2020) in support of anti-discrimination; though
                          not specifically in support of LGBT+ rights, nor targeting Qatar's lack, the rainbow symbol was
                          deemed offensive to the hosts.

                          works. On a Quest to make the best VR headset Meta has just announced that Meta Connect 2022 will
                          take place on October 11, and we may finally get a glimpse of its next VR headset: Project Cambria.
                          While this year’s Meta Connect might not be as wild as last year’s event – which saw the company
                          announce its bold metaverse ambitions and change its name from Facebook – it should give us a
                          better look at Meta’s Oculus Quest 2 successor, the so-called Project Cambria VR headset. It’s
                          worth noting that while Meta hasn’t explicitly said that Cambria – which will most likely
                          officially be called the Quest Pro – will be in attendance, it's strongly been hinted at it. For
                          starters, at the 2021 Connect Meta promised we’d see Cambria launch in 2022, which is only a few
                          months away from ending; combined with this year’s show’s promise to give attendees “a look at
                          what’s to come in the near and far future” for its metaverse ambitions and we can safely guess that
                          Cambria will get some stage time. But that’s not all.

                          Edwards, who began his five-year term as commissioner in January, said the ICO was also looking at
                          more than 50 other online services to see if they were complying with data laws relating to
                          children. He said the ICO had several ongoing investigations. “I’ve been clear that our work to
                          better protect children online involves working with organisations but will also involve
                          enforcement action where necessary,” he said. “We are currently looking into how over 50 different
                          online services are conforming with the children’s code and have six ongoing investigations looking
                          into companies providing digital services who have not, in our initial view, taken their
                          responsibilities around child safety seriously enough.” The Instagram owner, Meta, was fined €405m
                          (£349m) by the Irish data watchdog this month for letting teenagers set up accounts that publicly
                          displayed their phone numbers and email addresses. In May, the ICO fined the facial recognition
                          company Clearview AI £7.5m – the third largest it has imposed – for collecting images of people
                          from social media platforms and the web to add to a global database. The ICO ordered the US-based
                          firm to delete the data of UK people from its systems. The company has collected more than 20bn
                          images of people’s faces from Facebook, other social media companies and from scouring the web.

                          Gotham Knights is a 2022 action role-playing game developed by WB Games Montréal and published by
                          Warner Bros. Games. Inspired by the Batman: Gotham Knights comic series and based on the DC Comics
                          character Batman and his supporting cast, the game focuses on the characters Nightwing, Batgirl,
                          Robin, and Red Hood as they attempt to restore justice to Gotham City during a period of decline in
                          the immediate aftermath of Batman's death. While investigating the events that led to their
                          mentor's demise, the heroes become embroiled in an ancient conflict between two secret
                          organizations fighting for control of Gotham: the Court of Owls and the League of Shadows. Gameplay
                          is presented from the third-person perspective with a primary focus on using each playable
                          character's traversal and combat abilities to defeat enemies and explore the environment. Players
                          can freely move around Gotham City, interacting with characters, undertaking missions, and gaining
                          experience points and other resources to level up their characters and equipment. Outside of the
                          story, players are able to complete side missions to unlock additional content and collectible
                          items. A cooperative online multiplayer mode is also included, allowing two players to play through
                          the single-player campaign together while progressing in their own game. Gotham Knights was
                          released on October 21, 2022, for PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series X/S. Versions for the
                          PlayStation 4 and Xbox One were also planned, but were ultimately cancelled.

                          RIP CNN anchor and icon Bernard Shaw, who died yesterday at age 82, per his family. Deepest
                          condolences to his family, friends, and former colleagues. May his memory be a blessing.
                          pic.twitter.com/3Xh27a0ucH In a 2014 interview with NPR, Shaw said that he decided to retire to
                          spend more time with his family. He said, “Gnawing at me for years were the untold sacrifices that
                          my wife, Linda — we’ve been married 40 years — and my daughter Anil and my son Amar made. I will
                          never know the sacrifices they made so that I could do what I did. The countless weeks away from
                          them, the missing of so many precious moments in a child’s and a wife’s lifetime, experiences. And
                          it began to gnaw at us more, more, more. And I decided it was time to walk off the field when I was
                          approaching my 61st birthday.” In a statement to CNN, Shaw’s family requested that in lieu of
                          flowers, donations be made to the Bernard Shaw Scholarship Fund at the University of Chicago.” Shaw
                          is survived by his wife, Linda, and children, Anil and Amar. ©2022 Cox Media Group © 2023 Cox Media

                          the best broadcast journalist I could be. In all the years of preparing to become an anchor, one of
                          the things I strove for was to be able to control my emotions in the midst of hell breaking

                          On 8 September 2022, at 15:10 BST, Elizabeth II, Queen of the United Kingdom and the other
                          Commonwealth realms, and the longest-reigning British monarch, died at Balmoral Castle in
                          Aberdeenshire, Scotland, at the age of 96. Her death was publicly announced at 18:30. She was
                          succeeded by her eldest son, Charles III. The death of Queen Elizabeth II set in motion Operation
                          London Bridge, a collection of plans including arrangements for her state funeral, and supported by
                          Operation Unicorn, which set protocols for her death occurring in Scotland. The United Kingdom
                          observed a national mourning period of 10 days. The Queen's lying in state took place in
                          Westminster Hall from 14 to 19 September, during which time an estimated 250,000 people queued to
                          pay their respects. Elizabeth's state funeral on 19 September was the first held in Britain since
                          Winston Churchill's in 1965. A funeral service was held at Westminster Abbey, followed by a
                          procession to Wellington Arch that featured around 3,000 military personnel and was watched by
                          around a million people in central London. The state hearse then transported the Queen's coffin to
                          Windsor, followed by another procession through Windsor Great Park and a committal service at St
                          George's Chapel at Windsor Castle.

                          Although she faced occasional republican sentiment and media criticism of her family—particularly
                          after the breakdowns of her children's marriages, her annus horribilis in 1992, and the death in
                          1997 of her former daughter-in-law Diana—support for the monarchy in the United Kingdom remained
                          consistently high throughout her lifetime, as did her personal popularity. In September 2022,
                          Elizabeth died aged 96 at Balmoral Castle in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, and was succeeded by her
                          eldest son, Charles III. Elizabeth was born on 21 April 1926, the first child of Prince Albert,
                          Duke of York (later King George VI), and his wife, Elizabeth, Duchess of York (later Queen
                          Elizabeth The Queen Mother). Her father was the second son of King George V and Queen Mary, and her
                          mother was the youngest daughter of Scottish aristocrat Claude Bowes-Lyon, 14th Earl of Strathmore
                          and Kinghorne. She was delivered at 02:40 (GMT)[1] by Caesarean section at her maternal

                          Gordon Lang, baptised her in the private chapel of Buckingham Palace on 29 May,[3][b] and she was
                          named Elizabeth after her mother; Alexandra after her paternal great-grandmother, who had died six
                          months earlier; and Mary after her paternal grandmother.

                          Calvert is the famed handicapper who called Stan Wawrinka winning the 2014 Australian Open at 60-1
                          -- the last Australian title won by someone other than Djokovic, Rafael Nadal or Roger Federer.
                          Calvert took down a huge score on Dominic Thiem winning the 2019 Indian Wells title at 80-1, among
                          many stunning calls. In addition, Calvert nailed Casper Ruud making the 2022 French Open final,
                          winning big for anyone who backed him. Sean also hit all three of his picks at plus-money odds in
                          the Wimbledon final, including Novak Djokovic winning three sets to one at +275. Now, Calvert has

                          the betting favorite in the match, and he could become the No. 1 player in the world by the end of
                          the week. This is his first grand slam semifinal, and he is the youngest player to reach the US

                          May 6, 2023. Photo by Victoria Jones/Pool via REUTERS To the royal family and government, the
                          occasion — code-named Operation Golden Orb — was a display of heritage, tradition and spectacle
                          unmatched around the world. To the crowds gathered under rainy skies — thousands of whom had camped
                          overnight — it was a chance to be part of a historic event. Julie Newman, a 77-year-old visitor
                          from Canada, said the royal procession had been “absolutely fabulous. Couldn’t ask for anything
                          better.” “But we’re ready to go back home and watch it all on the television,” she added. But to
                          millions more, the day was greeted with a shrug, the awe and reverence the ceremony was designed to
                          evoke largely gone. And to a few, it was reason to protest. Hundreds who want to see Britain become
                          a republic gathered to holler “Not my king.” They see the monarchy as an institution that stands
                          for privilege and inequality, in a country of deepening poverty and fraying social ties. A handful
                          were arrested. WATCH: Pageantry and protests surround coronation of King Charles III As the day
                          began, the abbey buzzed with excitement and was abloom with fragrant flowers and colorful hats.

                          a collection of greatest hits and studio albums that have been certified by the Recording Industry
                          Association of America. He also has a host of Academy of Country Music Awards, in addition to
                          Grammy Award nominations. But the "You're Gonna Miss This" singer admitted he was a little
                          intimidated to work with legendary actress Susan Sarandon in their upcoming country music drama
                          about a dynasty of singers in "Monarch." Adkins portrays Albie Roman alongside Sarandon, who plays
                          Dottie Cantrell Roman, in the series, which is set to debut in September on FOX, and marks his
                          first starring role. He told Fox News Digital that working with Sarandon was "terrifying," but he
                          knew he was learning the ropes from a true icon. "It was terrifying at first, but then very quickly
                          I realized that she is so good, so professional, that she is going to carry the scene," Adkins
                          said. "You just try to hang on and make it to the buzzer, and she’ll take care of it. When asked
                          what it was like to kiss the Academy Award-winning actress, he simply replied: "It was an honor.

                          role, even though his friends Blake Shelton and Tim McGraw have years of TV experience. Blake has

                          ethics of civilians poking their noses into real-life tragedies. Everyone wants to be a hero. But
                          what lengths might one go to get there? This is the winsome yet disturbing journey at the center of
                          Susie Searches. Kiersey Clemons stars as Susie Wallis, a socially awkward college student with a
                          mind for solving mysteries. Naturally, she has her own true crime podcast called Susie Searches, so
                          when fellow student/meditation influencer Jesse (Alex Wolff) goes missing, her interest in cracking
                          the case isn't exactly selfless. If she finds the internet-adored victim, she and her podcast could
                          score the validation she desperately craves. Whether she's squeezing the sheriff (Jim Gaffigan) for
                          clues, eying a convenient creep (Ken Marino) as a suspect, or scouting out evidence, Susie is on a
                          mission to save the day…and promote herself. Forget the hardscrabble detectives of film noir; Susie
                          has more in common with Oliver Putnam than she does Sam Spade. Rather than a gun and a trench coat,
                          she carries a big smile smacked with colorful braces and a disarming demeanor that tends to make
                          people underestimate her. She seems childish for a college student and ridiculous as an
                          investigator. But!

                          The problem begins with Clemons. A film like Susie Searches demands a star turn, high voltage,
                          explosively quirky nerdery and histrionics. Think Flick, Nicole Kidman in To Die For, or either
                          lead in Agnieszka Smoczynska’s recent The Silent Twins. Clemons is mute, blank, inexpressive,
                          bored, taciturn, seeming even resentful of being there. Wolff clearly dislikes the type of zoomer
                          he’s portraying, delivering a good deal of his lines with embarrassed insecurity. The film is not a
                          failure in toto, but its failure to launch can only be credited to Kargman. The edit is the film’s
                          most disastrous component, frequently cutting away from critical reactions and lingering too long
                          on silence, stillness, and useless moments of transition. Kargman knew what type of movie she
                          wanted to make, and she more or less made one. All the parts are there, yet the intrepid detective
                          still struggles to understand how they connect. Little White Lies is committed to championing great

Question 143              : Which team will Kyle Busch join in 2023?
Correct Answers         :  
                          Richard Childress Racing

  - Answer              : Richard Childress Racing
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          By Alex Zietlow Kyle Busch is moving from one storied racing team to another. The multi-time NASCAR
                          Cup Series champion will join Richard Childress Racing in 2023, according to a report from Jordan
                          Bianchi of The Athletic. The move ends a successful 15-year tenure with Joe Gibbs Racing. An
                          official announcement is expected Tuesday, per the report. The news punctuates an eventful and
                          “stressful” regular season for Busch, whose free agency dominated headlines and clouded a
                          playoff-caliber season in 2022. It did so because his looming free agency revealed a strange
                          reality in NASCAR economics — that one of the sport’s biggest stars would have to struggle to find
                          a home (even with taking a pay cut) because of something outside of his control. That “something”
                          outside of his control, in this case, was the result of the Mars Inc. decision to exit NASCAR at
                          the end of the year, leaving Joe Gibbs Racing (Busch’s current team) without a primary sponsor for
                          Busch’s No. 18 team. Busch confirmed to reporters earlier this month that he had “more than one”
                          team extend official contract offers to him. RCR was among those companies, per reports at the
                          time. He also said that his uncertain future had been weighing on him. “It weighs on you every
                          time, every day of the week,” Busch said at NASCAR’s playoff media day before the race at
                          Darlington.

                          His career average finish is 13.8, and no full-time RCR driver has reached that mark since Ryan
                          Newman in 2015. And on top of driving for RCR, his deal is also leading him to swap manufacturers
                          for Kyle Busch Motorsports in the Craftsman Truck Series. His team will be branded by Chevrolet in
                          2023, a major overhaul with Chase Purdy and Jack Wood joining the team. Fortunately for Busch, he
                          will not have to worry about finding sponsors at RCR. 3CHI, Alsco, BetMGM, Cheddars and Lenovo have
                          all confirmed they will sponsor the No. 8 car. And if anyone can bring back a championship trophy
                          to RCR, it will be Busch.

                          When Rafael Nadal was eliminated from semi-final contention at the Nitto ATP Finals on Tuesday
                          evening, history was made. Nineteen-year-old Carlos Alcaraz will become the youngest year-end ATP
                          No. 1 presented by Pepperstone in history (since 1973), making him the first teen to accomplish the
                          feat. The Spaniard has enjoyed an unforgettable rise in 2022, ascending from World No. 32 at the
                          start of the year to the top of the men’s tennis mountain on 12 September. That is the biggest jump
                          to No. 1 in 50 editions of the year-end Pepperstone ATP Rankings. Before this year, the youngest
                          year-end ATP No. 1 was Lleyton Hewitt, who was aged 20 years, 275 days when he did it in 2001.
                          Alcaraz will be 19 years, 214 days on 5 December, the 2022 year-end ranking date following the last
                          ATP Challenger Tour events of the season. Alcaraz is the 18th year-end ATP No. 1 presented by
                          Pepperstone in history and the first outside the Big Four of Novak Djokovic (7), Roger Federer (5),
                          Nadal (5) and Andy Murray (1) since Andy Roddick in 2003.

                          7, but that’s all because of Wimbledon. He’s playing like the No. 1 player in the world. It’s not
                          apples to apples like other years.” Under the normal points system, Djokovic might not even qualify
                          for the ATP Finals in Turin, Italy, this year. Heading into Paris, he was in 10th place in the
                          points race. But under the ATP’s Grand Slam champion rule, any player who wins a major title and is
                          ranked within the top 20 is guaranteed a spot in the year-end championship. (The WTA Tour has no
                          such rule, which is why Djokovic’s fellow Wimbledon champion, Elena Rybakina, did not qualify for
                          the WTA Finals in Fort Worth.) “Most of the upheaval this year is because of Djokovic,” Patrick
                          McEnroe, a former United States Davis Cup captain and now an ESPN commentator said. “He missed two
                          majors and didn’t get points for the one he won. It really affected the rest of the field. You
                          could make the case that if Djokovic runs the table, wins Paris and the ATP Finals, that he
                          deserves to be No. 1.” The player most likely to end 2022 at No. 1 is Alcaraz. So far he has won
                          five tournaments this year, including ATP Masters 1000s in Miami and Madrid. In Madrid, he beat
                          Nadal, Djokovic and Alexander Zverev in succession.

                          and Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Welliver also happens to be a huge comic book fan and didn’t take much
                          convincing to join Titans, showrunner Greg Walker said. "You usually have to do this whole
                          dog-and-pony show to get an actor to do the show. But when I called to kind of lure him in, I could
                          barely get a word in. We were talking on the phone and he was just walking through his library,
                          telling me about all his Wolfman/Perez Titans editions. He's a giant, giant fan. He'd watched every
                          episode of the show, and could tell me about certain stories, certain shots. It was the most
                          unexpected call I've ever had." As for the character itself, Walker promised a comic-accurate
                          portrayal. Luthor is one of the most menacing and cunning villains ever, having bested Superman
                          several times using nothing but his wits. Titans will stay true to Luthor’s comic persona. "He has
                          a very sensitive, thoughtful approach to evil and power. You know what he's done, what he's capable
                          of doing, except like many of those people, he's personable. He doesn't have a cat on his lap.
                          Yeah. He's curious, which I think is very interesting about his character.

                          complete. The internet giant revealed plans to acquire publicly traded Mandiant back in March, less
                          than a year after Mandiant was spun out of its previous owner FireEye as part of a $1.2 billion
                          deal with private equity firm Symphony Technology Group. Moving forward, Mandiant will operate
                          under the auspices of Google Cloud, though the Mandiant brand will live on. “We will retain the
                          Mandiant brand and continue Mandiant’s mission to make every organization secure from cyber threats
                          and confident in their readiness,” Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian wrote in a blog post. Mandiant

                          priority,” she said. “Companies just won’t have a seat at the table if they aren’t thinking about
                          security first because it’s a business imperative.” Experts agree: If Google wants to build out its
                          cloud business, tripling down on security is essential. "The enterprise is only as secure as its
                          least secure employee," said Ravichandran. The cybersecurity space is one that's generally been
                          deal-heavy, so looking ahead we'll likely see Big Tech, investors, and private companies strike
                          more deals in the sector, said Ravichandran. "Historically, we’ve seen fairly regular M&A in the
                          cybersecurity industry," he said. "In September alone, there were nearly 40 cybersecurity company
                          acquisitions, which signals that there is still a lot of opportunity when companies identify a
                          strategic fit." Rubin agrees, adding that these deals will grow even more important as
                          cybersecurity becomes an increasingly indispensable part of business strategies and outlooks. "The
                          Google and Mandiant deal is the latest in a string of high-profile, billion-dollar cybersecurity
                          acquisitions over the past few years, and it certainly won’t be the last," he told Yahoo Finance.
                          "If Google is willing to go 'all in' on cyber, clearly their customers believe security is core to
                          everything.

                          The annual inflation rate for the United States was 3.0% for the 12 months ended June, according to
                          U.S. Labor Department data published on July 12, 2023. This follows a rise of 4.0% in the previous

                          the December column. For instance, the inflation rate in 2022 was 6.5%. Meanwhile, the "Ave" column
                          shows the average inflation rate for each year using CPI data. In 2022, the average inflation rate
                          was 8.0%. These average rates are published by the BLS but are rarely discussed in the news media,

                          Nintendo has guarded the new Breath of the Wild game so tightly that players do not even know the
                          title of the new Legend of Zelda. Fans have called the Nintendo game The Legend of Zelda: Breath of
                          the Wild 2, BOTW 2, and the Sequel to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. However, according
                          to a new rumor, the Breath of the Wild 2 name may finally have leaked online. While “new details”
                          about the Zelda game come and go, the newest rumor might hold more water than the others. While the
                          alleged title is still a rumor, the next adventure of Link and Zelda is “The Legend of Zelda:
                          Breath of Duality.” According to Nintendo Life, the report comes from veteran video game journalist
                          Paul Gale “who runs his own website, appeared in Nintendo Power, and worked with many other video
                          game outlets over the years,” according to Nintendo Life. In a post, Gale reports that “the sequel
                          to BotW and its main hook is right in the name, which establishes on the ‘Breath’ familiarity from
                          the 2017 hit and [gives] a nod to the fact that you can play as more than the aforementioned

                          “The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom” is perhaps the most highly anticipated video game of
                          the year. (In fact, it won that very award in 2022 – the wait has been long.) And by all accounts,
                          it’s living up to the hype: “Tears of the Kingdom,” released May 12, has already broken sales
                          records, earned raves from experts like IGN and longtime “Zelda” fans, and driven some fans to take
                          time off from work to dive into its intricate, enveloping world. The very first “Zelda” game was
                          released in 1986, and almost 40 years later, Link’s adventures are still enchanting gamers and
                          infuriating those who don’t have over 100 hours to spend discovering the game’s many hidden
                          treasures. Here’s what you need to know about the newest installment in the “Zelda” franchise, sans

                          acclaimed game, “Breath of the Wild.” But just when he thought he could hand up his green tunic,
                          super-villain Ganondorf returns to wreak havoc, taking the wise Princess Zelda with him. Link sets
                          out to find her – and to once again save Hyrule from one of its most prevalent threats. But oh!

                          time off from work to dive into its intricate, enveloping world. The very first “Zelda” game was
                          released in 1986, and almost 40 years later, Link’s adventures are still enchanting gamers and
                          infuriating those who don’t have over 100 hours to spend discovering the game’s many hidden
                          treasures. Here’s what you need to know about the newest installment in the “Zelda” franchise, sans
                          spoilers. Link, now a knight of the kingdom of Hyrule, just got done saving Hyrule in 2017’s
                          acclaimed game, “Breath of the Wild.” But just when he thought he could hand up his green tunic,
                          super-villain Ganondorf returns to wreak havoc, taking the wise Princess Zelda with him. Link sets
                          out to find her – and to once again save Hyrule from one of its most prevalent threats. But oh!

                          The hearse carrying Queen Elizabeth II's coffin stopped briefly as it arrived in the town of
                          Windsor, west of London, on Monday afternoon, so troops from the British Army's Grenadier Guards
                          could take their places flanking the vehicle for it's slow, final push to Windsor Castle. Once the
                          procession reaches the grounds of Windsor Castle, it will be joined by King Charles III and the

                          on Niwot,” said Cary Hayes, who lives across the street from where one of the planes went down.
                          “It’s scary. It’s super scary. It happened right across the street from my house,” Hayes said.
                          Mountain View Fire Rescue said that crews arrived at the site of the plane crash located at 10111
                          Niwot Rd. around 10 a.m. Shortly thereafter, they determined a second plane was involved. “It took

                          the two planes involved were a Cessna 172 and a Sonex Xenos. NTSB said the Cessna aircraft was
                          flown by two pilots, one was a flight instructor and another a student pilot. Both were declared
                          dead at the scene. The second plane was found in the 9700 block of Niwot Road. The sole pilot was
                          also declared dead at the scene. “These skies are full all day with single-seater planes,” Tufts
                          said. NTSB provided an update on their investigation into the cause of the collision.

                          flown by two pilots, one was a flight instructor and another a student pilot. Both were declared
                          dead at the scene. The second plane was found in the 9700 block of Niwot Road. The sole pilot was
                          also declared dead at the scene. “These skies are full all day with single-seater planes,” Tufts

Question 165              : Who is Italy's first female prime minister?
Correct Answers         :

  - Source              :
                          Populist firebrand Giorgia Meloni has been named as Italy’s first female prime minister, becoming
                          the country’s most far-right leader since Benito Mussolini. She received the mandate to form a
                          government from Italy’s President Sergio Mattarella on Friday afternoon after two days of official
                          consultations, and is set to be sworn in at 10 a.m. local time (4 a.m. ET) on Saturday. Last
                          month’s general election resulted in an alliance of far-right and center-right parties, led by her
                          ultraconservative Brothers of Italy, winning enough seats in Italy’s parliament to form a
                          government. Meloni announced her government picks in Rome’s Quirinal Palace, making the leader of
                          Italy’s far right League party, Matteo Salvini, infrastructure minister. Giancarlo Giorgetti, also
                          of the League party, was made economy minister. Antonio Tajani from the Forza Italia party was
                          given the position of minister of foreign affairs while the role of defense minister went to Guido
                          Crosetto, one of the founders of the Brothers of Italy party. The new government will be made up of
                          a coalition of Meloni’s Brothers of Italy party, Salvini’s League party and the Forza Italia party,
                          led by former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. The Brothers of Italy received nine
                          ministries whereas Forza Italia and the League each received five ministries.

                          teenage Birmingham City midfielder Jordan James for their Nations League games against Belgium and
                          Poland on 22 and 25 September after injury ruled out Joe Allen. Uncapped James, 18, has played for
                          England Under-20s and was last week included in the Wales Under-21 squad. Senior Wales boss Robert
                          Page has now promoted James to his squad. While a hamstring strain ruled out Allen, defender Ben

                          injuries with their clubs. Davies, 29, is expected to be out for around three weeks after suffering
                          his injury in Spurs' Champions League defeat by Sporting Lisbon. Allen came off in Swansea's 3-0
                          Championship win over Hull on Saturday. Wales travel to Belgium on Thursday before hosting Poland
                          three days later. Spurs manager Antonio Conte has said Davies will not be available for Wales duty.
                          "He had an injury in his knee in the game against Sporting Lisbon, and he played with this injury,"

                          Inserted into the game when the Aces went to their small-ball lineup, Williams scored eight
                          straight points for the Aces on a pair of 3-pointers and step-back jumper. Kelsey Plum added a
                          bucket, Jackie Young added a free throw and that was it. Chelsea Gray led the way for the Aces with
                          another terrific postseason performance, finishing with 20 points, five rebounds and six assists on
                          9 of 13 from the field. For her efforts, not only in Game 4 but throughout the series, Gray was

                          Game 4: After another disappointing early playoff exit last season, the Aces decided to make a

                          Things you buy through our links may earn Vox Media a commission. The Golden Globe Awards has
                          always been the unserious awards show, the awards show with sketchy ethics, the one during which
                          everyone gets drunk on live television so they can say they came for the free booze if anyone
                          questions their behavior. But for many years, the industry acted as if it was important: The Globes
                          marked the start of awards season, provided a hint at what might happen at the Academy Awards, and
                          shined a spotlight on films and TV shows that mainstream audiences might have missed. That is,
                          until 2021, when a Los Angeles Times investigation revealed that the Hollywood Foreign Press
                          Association, a nonprofit, was engaging in financial improprieties and had zero Black members.
                          Talent pulled out of attending the 2022 ceremony, NBC opted not to broadcast the show, and while
                          Golden Globes were still technically awarded, no one really paid attention. Which brings us to
                          Tuesday night, a weird night for an awards show and the NBC return of the ceremony. It was as if
                          this telecast, hosted by a truth-telling Jerrod Carmichael and, unofficially for a couple of
                          stretches, Jennifer Coolidge, took an edible at the beginning of the evening and got a teensy bit

                          Google is a brand that we all know and either love or hate. Aside from being the company behind
                          many web services, Google has done quite well with its Pixel smartphones — with the latest being
                          the Google Pixel 7 family. In 2022, Google also released its first smartwatch, the Google Pixel
                          Watch, though it received mixed reviews overall. We’re expecting Google to release a follow-up to
                          the Pixel Watch sometime this year in the form of the Pixel Watch 2 and, hopefully, it will improve
                          upon what was already established with the original. Though there haven’t been a lot of leaked
                          reports about the Pixel Watch 2, here’s what we know so far about the upcoming smartwatch. The
                          Google Pixel Watch launched with a unique aesthetic that was both modern and minimalistic. With
                          that in mind, we should expect the Google Pixel Watch 2 to have the same kind of design, with a
                          domed display, rotating digital crown, and unobtrusive band mechanisms. However, if Google could
                          improve anything with the design here, it should start with thinner bezels on the round display.
                          Durability should be around the same as the first Pixel Watch, and it’s expected to run a version
                          of Wear OS, possibly Wear OS 4. This would mean a clean, Google-focused user experience with
                          customizable tiles, Fitbit integration, and third-party app support. Since the original Google
                          Pixel Watch had Fitbit integration, that should continue with the Google Pixel Watch 2.

                          affect our editorial independence. Google finally released its first Pixel smartwatch in 2022,
                          impressing us with its usability and features. Now, as the sequel is due, what has the search giant
                          got up its rather ample sleeves? We round up all the news and rumours we’ve seen so far about the
                          Google Pixel Watch 2. There’s no official word yet from Google, and the Google I/O event in May
                          2023 came and went without any mention or tease of an update to the smartwatch range, instead only
                          covering the Pixel 7a, Pixel Fold, and Pixel Tablet. Instead, 9to5Google reports that the Pixel
                          Watch 2 will make its debut in October 2023 alongside the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro. Again, there’s
                          no confirmed price details from Google at this point in time. With the Pixel Watch only being
                          released in October 2022, we don’t think there will be too much change from the price of that
                          smartwatch: We don’t know the official specs of the Google Pixel Watch 2 yet, so we’re relying on
                          the rumours that have surfaced so far to give us a clue on what we might see when the new model
                          arrives.

                          launched in the Fall of 2021 with a generous donation from sports journalist and Seton Hall alumnus
                          Bob Ley '76, who anchored the SportsCenter desk with Roberts at ESPN and on location at events from
                          Atlanta to South Africa. "The Center for Sports Media is already bursting with activity benefiting
                          our students, and it holds tremendous promise," said Ley. "Our Gala on September 15th will gather
                          friends and supporters of the Center to celebrate our official launch and set our ambitious course.
                          To recognize my dear friend and colleague Robin with our inaugural Award will cap the night, as she

                          Prime Minister of Japan and President of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) from 2006 to 2007 and
                          again from 2012 to 2020. He was the longest-serving prime minister in Japanese history, serving for
                          almost nine years in total. Abe also served as Chief Cabinet Secretary from 2005 to 2006 under
                          Junichiro Koizumi and was briefly the opposition leader in 2012. Abe was born into a prominent
                          political family in Tokyo and was the grandson of Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi. After graduating
                          from Seikei University and briefly attending the University of Southern California, Abe was elected
                          to the Japanese House of Representatives in the 1993 election. Abe was appointed Chief Cabinet
                          Secretary by Prime Minister Koizumi in 2005 before replacing him as prime minister and LDP
                          president the following year. Confirmed by the National Diet, Abe became Japan's youngest post-war
                          prime minister and the first born after World War II.

                          local time on Saturday, a car believed to be carrying his body left the hospital, NHK reported.
                          Yamagami, who appeared to have used a homemade weapon in the attack, was arrested and charged with
                          attempted murder, according to NHK. He was held for questioning at Nara Nishi police station.
                          During a news conference Friday, Nara Nishi police said the 41-year-old suspect, who is unemployed,
                          holds hatred toward a certain group to which he thought Abe was related. Police raided the
                          suspect’s apartment at 5:17 p.m. local time, where they confiscated several handmade pistol-like
                          items, police said. Yamagami is being investigated as a suspect in a murder case, to which 90
                          investigators have been assigned, the police added. Japan’s National Police Agency will review
                          security arrangements for Abe, NHK reported Saturday. NHK reported the police agency said the Nara
                          prefectural police drew up a security plan for the former prime minister while in the city. The
                          prefecture’s police officers and security personnel from the Tokyo Metropolitan police had remained
                          on the lookout and had reportedly watched Abe from all sides during his speech, NHK reported.
                          Several dozen officers, including the Nara prefecture’s plain-clothed police officers and one
                          specially assigned personnel from the Tokyo police force, were on duty, NHK reported.

                          Austin-based cinema entertainment center chain EVO Entertainment Group announced its acquisition of
                          the Times Square Grand Slam cinema in Tyler, TX. The 65,000-square-foot venue includes seven cinema
                          screens, 70+ arcade games, 22 bowling lanes, a two-level laser tag arena, virtual reality
                          entertainment, an all-ages ropes course, and a restaurant called the Infield. It marks the 20th
                          EVO-operated location across five states, making it the nation’s largest operator of cinema
                          entertainment centers. (Not all of their locations have the EVO name.) This acquisition gives the
                          company a new total of 175 screens and 151 bowling lanes. “Every year, we provide elevated
                          entertainment experiences to more than 8 million guests,” EVO’s CEO Mitch Roberts said in a press
                          release. “We are thrilled to add Times Square Grand Slam to our portfolio, as they represent the
                          same high-quality entertainment experience that we have become known for at EVO.” Share this post

                          The girls are back for one last adventure. The third and final season of Derry Girls has an
                          American release date. TVLine reports that the series, which stars Saoirse-Monica Jackson, Nicola
                          Coughlan, Jamie-Lee O'Donnell, Louisa Harland and Dylan Llewellyn, will be available on the
                          streaming platform on October 7. Netflix's official Twitter posted a tweet stating it was hard to
                          say goodbye to the show, saying the "final season of our beloved Derry Girls arrives October 7 on
                          Netflix (outside The UK & Ireland)." Last fall, creator and writer Lisa McGee confirmed on Twitter
                          the third season would be the last, and that it was always the plan to have the show end after
                          three seasons. "Derry Girls is a coming of age story...a love letter to the place I come from and
                          the people who shaped me," McGee said, also commenting it was an honor to write the show, and she
                          was proud of what it had accomplished and achieved. The show premiered in the UK and Ireland in
                          January 2018 and on Netflix in December 2018. The first season garnered praise among critics and
                          fans, holding a 100% Certified Fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and the second season holding a 97%
                          Certified Fresh rating.

                          Derry Girls is a British teen sitcom, created and written by Lisa McGee, that premiered on 4
                          January 2018 on Channel 4[4] and ran for three series. The channel's most successful comedy since
                          Father Ted, the series was inspired by McGee's own experiences growing up in Derry, Northern
                          Ireland, in the 1990s, during the final years of the Troubles.[5] It stars Saoirse-Monica Jackson,
                          Louisa Harland, Nicola Coughlan, Jamie-Lee O'Donnell, and Dylan Llewellyn as five teenagers living
                          in mid-1990s Derry while attending Our Lady Immaculate College, a fictional girls' Catholic
                          secondary school based on the real-life Thornhill College, where McGee herself studied.[6][7]
                          Produced by British production company Hat Trick Productions, Derry Girls is filmed in Northern
                          Ireland, with most scenes shot on location in Derry and some in Belfast. Although the plot lines of
                          Derry Girls are fictional, the series frequently references actual events of the Troubles and the
                          Northern Ireland peace process, including the 1994 IRA ceasefire announcement, the 1995 visit to
                          Northern Ireland of President Bill Clinton and First Lady Hillary Clinton, and the Good Friday
                          referendum of 1998.

                          line between memoir and fiction. In making the announcement, the committee noted the "clinical
                          acuity with which she uncovers the roots, estrangements and collective restraints of personal
                          memory." The permanent secretary also noted during his announcement that they had not been able to
                          reach Ernaux to let her know of the award, worth approximately $900,000 in U.S. dollars. Ernaux was
                          born in 1940 in France. Her first book, Cleaned Out, in 1974, was an autobiographical novel about
                          obtaining an abortion when it was still illegal in France. She wrote the book in secret. "My
                          husband had made fun of me after my first manuscript," she told the New York Times in 2020. "I
                          pretended to work on a Ph.D. thesis to have time alone." The book was translated into English in
                          1990.

                          actually her who was being mentioned as the latest laureate.[10] She described her initial feeling
                          "like... you are in the desert and there is a call that is coming from the sky."[10] Asked what
                          would be her message for young writers, especially for those who are writing in their native
                          language, she said: "I think that when we write, what is really important is that we need to read a
                          lot. Sometimes young people say, 'Oh no, I don't read... I write!' Well, no. That's not possible.
                          You need to read a lot. And the second message I would give them is not to strive to write well,
                          but rather to write honestly. It's not the same thing."[10] At a public press conference, she told
                          journalists the following statement regarding her responsibility with the prize: "The Nobel
                          [prize], it hasn't sunk in yet, but it's true I feel I have a new responsibility. This
                          responsibility is about carrying on the fight against injustice, whatever it is. I use the term
                          'injustice' but it has different levels. Everything that is a form of injustice towards women,
                          towards those I call the dominated ones. I can tell you I will fight until my last breath so that
                          women be able to choose to become mothers or to choose not to.

                          line between memoir and fiction. In making the announcement, the committee noted the "clinical
                          acuity with which she uncovers the roots, estrangements and collective restraints of personal
                          memory." The permanent secretary also noted during his announcement that they had not been able to
                          reach Ernaux to let her know of the award, worth approximately $900,000 in U.S. dollars. Ernaux was
                          born in 1940 in France. Her first book, Cleaned Out, in 1974, was an autobiographical novel about
                          obtaining an abortion when it was still illegal in France. She wrote the book in secret. "My
                          husband had made fun of me after my first manuscript," she told the New York Times in 2020. "I
                          pretended to work on a Ph.D. thesis to have time alone." The book was translated into English in
                          1990.

                          Television Writer Fox has wasted little time in naming a new CEO for its entertainment division.
                          Rob Wade, the broadcast network’s head of alternative entertainment, has been promoted to CEO of
                          Fox Entertainment. The move comes two weeks after the announcement that previous CEO Charlie
                          Collier was leaving to head up Roku’s media business. “Since the formation of Fox Entertainment,
                          Rob has been an integral part of the leadership team responsible for delivering on its long-term

                          Lachlan Murdoch said in a statement. “Given Rob’s sharp creative instincts and proven operational
                          acumen, he is well-suited to lead Fox Entertainment in what promises to be an exciting next chapter

                          The remainder of the company would form a so-called "New Fox", maintaining control of assets such
                          as Fox's television network and broadcast stations (which Disney, already owning ABC, would be
                          legally unable to own due to an FCC policy known as the "dual network rule", which prohibits
                          mergers between the top broadcast networks), Fox News, the national operations of Fox Sports, and
                          the 20th Century Fox studio lot, which would be leased to Disney for seven years. Fox's regional
                          sports networks were also included in the sale, but were later divested by order of the Department
                          of Justice, on the grounds that the Fox regional networks' combination with Disney's 80% ownership
                          of ESPN would make Disney too dominant in the cable sports market.[14][15][16][17][18] In May 2018
                          it was confirmed that Lachlan Murdoch, rather than James Murdoch, would take charge of the New Fox
                          company.[3] In mid-2018 NBCUniversal's parent company Comcast instigated bidding wars over both the
                          Fox assets Disney planned to purchase, and the British broadcaster Sky plc (a company which 21st
                          Century Fox held a stake in, and was planning to acquire the remainder). In July 2018, Fox agreed
                          to an increase of Disney's offer to $71.3 billion to fend off Comcast's counter-bid.[19][20]
                          British regulators ordered that a blind auction be held for Sky's assets, which was won by
                          Comcast.[21]

Question 181              : Who won the Japanese Grand Prix 2022?
Correct Answers         :  
                          Max Verstappen
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prediction (only positive):
  - Answer              : Max Verstappen
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          Max Verstappen clinched what had long been expected with his win at the 2022 Japanese Grand Prix:
                          this year's drivers' title crown. It makes him a double world champion at 25 and now he's close to
                          breaking Formula 1's record for most wins in a single season, with four events still left to run.
                          But Verstappen's title celebrations were overshadowed by the chaos and confusion during and after
                          the wet race last Sunday, which has led to even more questions being raised about the procedures
                          and attitudes of motorsport's governing body. There was also plenty of intrigue further down the
                          field and off the track too. Here are the headline takeaways from F1's first visit back to Suzuka
                          in three years. Verstappen hugs Adrian Newey after claiming a second F1 world title Photo by: Sam
                          Bloxham / Motorsport Images It had been coming ever since Charles Leclerc crashed out of the lead
                          of the French GP: Verstappen was going to be the 2022 world champion. After his Suzuka triumph and
                          the Ferrari driver's latest error gifting Sergio Perez second, came Verstappen's coronation.
                          Although, as we'll get to soon, not immediately. Having missed his first, slim chance to seal the
                          title in Singapore seven days earlier, Verstappen wrested control in Japan. He edged Leclerc for
                          pole, then beat his rival in the race's two main challenges.

                          national anthem.[12] The race started at 14:00 local time on 9 October 2022 under torrential rain
                          (which was the reason for so many incidents in the race) and was red-flagged on lap 2 after Ferrari
                          driver Carlos Sainz Jr. lost control into the hairpin of the opening lap and aquaplaned into the
                          barriers. A recovery vehicle was immediately dispatched, with several drivers passing the tractor
                          at speed under double-yellow flags on the second lap.[13] Alex Albon also retired due a collision
                          with Kevin Magnussen which caused damage to his radiator.[14] The race resumed at 16:15 local time
                          behind the safety car. Only twenty-eight laps were completed before the race was curtailed due to
                          it passing the three-hour time limit, with Verstappen taking his twelfth victory of the season.
                          Leclerc, who finished second on track, was given a five-second penalty for cutting the final
                          chicane whist defending from Pérez in third, which demoted him to third behind Pérez. The win meant
                          that Verstappen took the Championship title, leading Pérez by 113 points, with 112 points still
                          available.

                          By Selome Hailu NBC has ordered six additional episodes of the “Quantum Leap” revival. The original
                          order of 12 episodes has now been extended to 18, bringing Season 1 to a total of 18 episodes. The
                          series premiered on Sept. 19 as a sequel to NBC’s 1989-1993 series of the same name. This version
                          stars Raymond Lee as Dr. Ben Seong, as a world-renowned physicist and a man of faith. 30 years
                          after Dr. Sam Beckett (Scott Bakula in the original series) stepped into the Quantum Leap
                          accelerator and vanished, a new team has been assembled to restart the project in the hopes of
                          understanding the mysteries behind the machine and the man who created it. Ernie Hudson, Caitlin
                          Bassett, Mason Alexander Park and Nanrisa Lee also star. NBC’s order makes “Quantum Leap” the first
                          new series of the fall TV season to receive an extension. According the network, the most recent
                          data suggests that it is the highest-rated new show in the 18-49 demographic.

                          fondly remembered, with many hopeful that Bakula will make an appearance in the upcoming revival.
                          While Bakula’s involvement status is currently unknown, producer Deborah M. Pratt has stated that
                          this new take on Quantum Leap is just the first step in a Quantum Leap universe. "I think it brings

                          can do,” she said. “I think we should do a series of movies, I think we should do a series of
                          series, and this is very much the first step into that world. And it will be up to the fans."

Question 184              : What is the price of RTX 4090 GPU?
Correct Answers         :

                          Searching for an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 to buy? Don’t worry. We’ve got your covered, by searching
                          through the best loot spots for you to get this beast of a GPU. The RTX 4090, Nvidia’s shining
                          star, is certainly one of the best graphics cards on the market right now. With jaw-dropping
                          performance metrics, it’s no wonder it carries a steep price tag of $1599. Since its introduction
                          on October 12, 2022, the Nvidia RTX 4090 has been going off the shelf rapidly. While retailers have
                          finally managed to get plenty of these powerful GPUs on their shelves, the Founders Edition is
                          always snatched up like hotcakes. As the speediest GPU in the 40-series, the RTX 4090 is far beyond
                          the capabilities of every other commercially available gaming GPU. If the hype around the RTX 4090
                          is anything to go by, we might see the RTX 4090 Ti drop sooner as a surprise patch update. Looking
                          back at previous releases, the RTX 4080 hit the scene in November, with the RTX 4070 Ti hot on its
                          heels in early January 2023, and the standard RTX 4070 was the latest to join the party. Even the
                          4060 Ti also debuted just over a month ago.

                          Nvidia's RTX 4060 is right around the corner, so it's really no surprise that the first benchmarks
                          are already starting to leak out. Today, two tests have been spotted, and they bode pretty well for
                          the GPU. The RTX 3060, which is still a favorite among Nvidia users, might be around 20% slower
                          than the upcoming Ada Lovelace model. Will the RTX 4060 become one of the best GPUs, or at least
                          one of the most popular models in this generation? One might think that a GPU that costs over
                          $40,000 is going to be the best graphics card for gaming, but the truth is a lot more complex than
                          that. In fact, this Nvidia GPU can't even keep up with integrated graphics solutions. Now, before
                          you get too upset, you should know I'm referring to Nvidia's H100, which houses the GH100 chip
                          (Grace Hopper). It's a powerful data center GPU made to handle high-performance computing (HPC)
                          tasks -- not power PC games. It doesn't have any display outputs, and despite its extensive
                          capabilities, it also doesn't have any coolers. This is because, again, you'd find this GPU in a
                          data center or server setting, where it'd be cooled with powerful external fans. Nvidia has just
                          quietly announced the official release date of the RTX 4060. The GPU is coming out on June 29 and
                          will be priced at $299.

                          Principal photography was set take place in the San Francisco Bay area and New York City that
                          summer.[9] The Great Recession caused a delay production and by April 2009 filming was expected to
                          start in Winnipeg.[10] Two Lagoons and Astra Blue Media were then attached to co-produce, along
                          with additional cast members of Mira Sorvino, Kevin Pollak, James Caan and Smokey Robinson.[10] By
                          July 2014, some cast members had been replaced.[11] Wood Harris replaced Simmons as Nat Clifton,
                          Nathan Lane would play Saperstein and James Caan as Ned Irish.[12] Brian Dennehy, Patrick Warburton
                          and Ludacris were all attached to star in undisclosed roles. The production budget was reported to
                          be $10 million and filming was expected to begin in New York in late 2014.[11] Production was
                          subsequently completed by October 2022, with Pollak as Saperstein, Dreyfuss as Maurice Podoloff,
                          Cary Elwes as Irish, Jeremy Piven as Joe Lapchick. Gary Clark Jr and Bobby Portis make cameos.[5]
                          Guigui and Jeff Cardoni composed the film's score.[13] Sweetwater was released by Briarcliff
                          Entertainment on April 14, 2023.[5] The soundtrack album was released by Candid Records on the
                          film's opening day.[14]

                          The Pixel Watch is a Wear OS smartwatch designed, developed, and marketed by Google as part of the
                          Google Pixel product line. First previewed in May 2022 during the Google I/O keynote, it features a
                          round dome-shaped display as well as heavy integration with Fitbit, which Google acquired in 2021.
                          Two Pixel-branded smartwatches had been in development at Google by July 2016, but they were
                          canceled ahead of their release due to hardware chief Rick Osterloh's concerns that they did not
                          fit well with other Pixel devices. Development on a new Pixel-branded watch began shortly after
                          Google's acquisition of Fitbit. The Pixel Watch was officially announced on October 6, 2022, at the
                          annual Made by Google event, and was released in the United States on October 13. In July 2016,
                          Google was reportedly developing two smartwatches, codenamed "Swordfish" and "Angelfish", which
                          were to be powered by the Android Wear operating system and expected to be released under the Nexus
                          brand name.[2] According to Business Insider, these watches were canceled ahead of the 2016 Made by
                          Google launch event due to concerns from Google hardware chief Rick Osterloh that they did not sync
                          well with the company's new Pixel devices; the smartwatches were eventually "salvaged" by LG and
                          released as the LG Watch Style and LG Watch Sport in February 2017.

                          5][20] In March 2016, Riot Games acquired Radiant Entertainment, another developer who was working
                          on Rising Thunder and Stonehearth at the time.[21] Rising Thunder was effectively canceled
                          following the acquisition, with the game's team allocated to a new project.[22] On October 13,
                          2017, Beck and Merrill announced that they were returning their focus to developing games, aiming
                          to create new experiences for video game and esports players.[23] Beck and Merrill handed over the
                          day-to-day operations and overall management of the League of Legends team to three longtime
                          employees: Dylan Jadeja, Scott Gelb, and Nicolo Laurent, who previously served as chief financial
                          officer (CFO), chief technology officer (CTO) and president, respectively.[23] Subsequently, Gelb
                          and Laurent assumed roles as chief operating officer (COO) and chief executive officer (CEO),
                          respectively, while Beck and Merrill became the Riot Games' chairmen.[24] As of May 2018[update],
                          Riot Games employed 2,500 people,[25] operating 24 offices around the world.[26] In October 2019,
                          Riot Games announced several new games: a version of League of Legends for mobile devices and
                          consoles called League of Legends: Wild Rift, a standalone mobile version of the Teamfight Tactics
                          mode from League of Legends, and the digital collectible card game titled Legends of Runeterra,
                          with all three scheduled for a 2020 release.

                          C.H. Robinson Worldwide Inc. (NASDAQ: CHRW) has chosen David Bozeman, an executive of the Ford
                          Motor Co., as its next CEO, according to people familiar with the matter. The announcement, which
                          is expected to be made as early as Monday, catapults Bozeman to the top job of the nation’s largest
                          freight broker. Bozeman is currently vice president of the customer services division and
                          enthusiast brands at Ford (NYSE: F). Before joining the automaker last August, Bozeman spent
                          five-plus years as vice president of Amazon Transportation Services. Before that, he spent more
                          than eight years in top positions at Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT) and more than 16 years at
                          Harley-Davidson Motor Co. (NYSE: HOG). The choice of Bozeman may come as a surprise to many who
                          thought that Jim Barber, a former COO at UPS Inc. (NYSE: UPS), to be the odds-on choice for the
                          job. The position has been open since Bob Biesterfeld was let go at the beginning of the year.
                          During its most recent analyst call, Robinson said a decision would be made and announced by the
                          end of June. Company executives were not immediately available for comment. Like virtually all
                          brokers, Robinson has struggled with a sharp downturn in demand. Robinson had also struggled in
                          recent months amid concerns about increased competition from the likes of new broker RXO Inc.
                          (NYSE: RXO).

Question 191              : What is the subscriber growth of Netflix in Q3 2022?
Correct Answers         :  
                          2.41 million
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prediction (only positive):
  - Answer              : +4.5 percent
  - Threshold           : 0.8

                          Enterprise and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply. Netflix added 2.41 million
                          global subscribers in the third quarter of 2022, bringing its grand total to 223.09 million (73.39
                          million from the U.S. and Canada), a gain of +4.5 percent over the prior year’s comparable quarter.
                          Q3 was the first quarter of 2022 when Netflix didn’t lose subs. According to Tuesday’s shareholder
                          letter, executives at Netflix believe they’ll add 4.50 million subs globally in the final quarter
                          of 2022. The streamer added 4.38 million subs in the year-ago quarter, which at the time
                          represented 9.4 percent growth. So we’re not there — but we are well above the company’s tempered
                          expectations; at the end of Q2, Netflix forecasted that it would add 1 million global subscribers
                          in Q3. Clearly, it bested that — the same goes for its financial forecasts. Netflix earned $3.10
                          per share in the third quarter on $7.926 billion in revenue; its net income was $1.398 billion.
                          Wall Street forecasted earnings of $2.13 per share on $7.84 billion in revenue. Back on July 19,
                          Netflix itself estimated Q3 earnings per share of $2.

                          6% in the past year, more than triple the S&P's 19.3% decline as of Oct. 16. Netflix posted robust
                          annual EPS growth during the pandemic in 2020 and 2021 as millions of customers worldwide sheltered
                          at home and turned to streaming entertainment services. On a quarterly basis, profit growth began
                          to decelerate during that period, slowing to 11.8% in the fourth quarter of 2021 and declining 5.9%
                          in this year's first quarter. Netflix's revenue grew by at least 20% annually between 2018 and 2020
                          and dropped to 8.6% in this year's second quarter. Growth in Q3 FY 2022 is expected to be 4.7%, the

                          your faces to take you on a brief journey into the future as we explore what the next, new episode
                          4 of Chicago PD’s current season 10 will be showing you when it comes out next Wednesday night,
                          October 12, 2022. We were able to snag up an official teaser description for one of episode 4’s
                          main storylines via NBC’s official episode 4 press release. So, we’re going to certainly take a
                          look at it right now. Let’s go. First off, NBC revealed that there is an official title for this
                          new episode 4 of Chicago PD’s current season 10. It turns out that the writers decided to name it,
                          “DONDE VIVES.” It sounds like episode 4 will feature some more very scandalous, intense, dramatic,
                          interesting, action-filled and suspenseful scenes. In the new episode 4, a shocking murder and a
                          rookie officer will be the main focus of this storyline that NBC chose to serve up on a platter.
                          Yep, it turns out that some major scandal will loom in this episode as very startling murder will
                          take place at some point.

                          “you will not receive a response.” The company did switch off a divisive experiment locking 4K
                          videos behind a Premium subscription, but I have a feeling this family plan price increase is here
                          to stay. “We don’t make these decisions lightly, and we realize how hard this may be for our
                          members,” YouTube spokesperson Marni Greenberg said in a statement. “This new price reflects the
                          complete value of YouTube Premium and will allow us to develop even more Premium features and
                          continue to support the creators and artists our members watch and listen to on YouTube.” The cost
                          of an individual YouTube Premium plan remains unchanged at $11.99 per month. YouTube doesn’t have
                          anything to share today about changes to other plans, Greenberg said, but noted that the company
                          will notify users by email at least 30 days in advance before changing the price. Update October

                          thing, a showdown between Kratos and Thor was teased at the end of the last game, and we also
                          learned that Atreus' original name was Loki. With those two nuggets of information in mind, you
                          should expect big mysteries to unfold in the game and for more morsels of Norse mythology to factor
                          in this release. Revealed to the delight of many at the PlayStation Showcase event last year,
                          here's the first teaser trailer for God of War Ragnarök. While you wait for that God of War

Question 196              : Who is the new prime minister of the United Kingdom?
Correct Answers         :  
                          Rishi Sunak
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prediction (only positive):
  - Answer              : Rishi Sunak
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          The former chancellor wins Conservative Party leadership contest days after the dramatic
                          resignation of Liz Truss as prime minister. Rishi Sunak will become the United Kingdom’s new prime
                          minister after winning the ruling Conservative Party’s leadership contest, which was triggered by
                          the resignation of Liz Truss last week. Sunak’s win on Monday came days after Truss’s resignation
                          after her disastrous tax cuts plans and policy U-turns plunged the markets into chaos. The
                          unprecedented economic crisis drew a rare intervention from the Bank of England. Britain faces
                          serious economic challenges and needs stability and unity, Sunak said on Monday in his first public
                          speech since winning the contest. “There is no doubt we face a profound economic challenge,” Sunak
                          said. “We now need stability and unity, and I will make it my utmost priority to bring our party
                          and our country together.” Sunak, a former finance minister, has been left with the task of
                          steering a deeply divided country through an economic downturn set to make millions of people
                          poorer. Al Jazeera’s Andrew Simmons, reporting from London, said Sunak is “pretty well placed”
                          despite the challenges ahead. “In some ways, … some of his work has already been done in terms of
                          putting out the fires that Liz Truss created because it did cause a storm in the markets,” Simmons
                          said.

  - Answer              : Jeremy Hunt
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          After Liz Truss' imploded premiership left the Conservative poll numbers sinking to historic lows,
                          Sunak will have around two years to restore confidence among his legislators that they can retain
                          power at the next national vote after 12 years of leading the government. "It's the Conservative
                          Party's last chance to put in a prime minister who might achieve some kind of stability," says
                          Bronwen Maddox, CEO of Chatham House, the London-based think tank." She says Sunak now has to "try
                          to set out an economic plan and a plan for the country that gives the country some reassurance and
                          may even bring his party to a kind of unity, but that remains the big question." That economic plan
                          will be slightly easier to formulate now than it would have been even two weeks ago, as financial
                          markets have reacted positively to his selection, and after the country's new finance minister
                          Jeremy Hunt cancelled tax cuts trumpeted by Truss and her team. Hunt's role as a stabilizing force
                          may help him retain the role that he was appointed to by Truss. That market reaction has meant
                          government borrowing costs have fallen to where they had been before Truss took the reins, reducing
                          government spending on interest and thus allowing Sunak to better balance the books when he needs
                          to borrow money to fund long-term spending. But he will still need to deal with high inflation
                          levels, elevated energy prices and a soaring cost of living.

                          (born May 12, 1980, Southampton, England), British politician and financier who became leader of
                          the Conservative Party and prime minster of the United Kingdom in October 2022. Previously he
                          served as chancellor of the Exchequer (2020–22). Sunak was born into a family with immigrant roots.
                          His grandparents emigrated from Punjab, in northwestern India, to East Africa, where his mother and
                          father were born in Tanzania and Kenya, respectively. They met and married after their families
                          migrated in the 1960s to Southampton in southern England. Sunak’s father became a general
                          practitioner for the National Health Service. His mother, a pharmacist, owned and operated a small
                          pharmacy, for which Sunak, the eldest of their three children, would eventually keep the books.
                          Later, during his political career, Sunak would draw parallels between his experiences working in
                          the family business and the values he gained from them and those of Conservative Party icon
                          Margaret Thatcher, the daughter of a grocer. As a result of his parents’ sacrifices and saving to
                          fund his education, Sunak was able to attend Winchester College, the exclusive private school that
                          has produced no fewer than six chancellors of the Exchequer.

Question 198              : How much does the Netflix Basic with Ads subscription cost?
Correct Answers         :  
                          6.99
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prediction (only positive):

                          Related Stories Move over "Stranger Things," the next big Netflix hit may just be commercials. The
                          streaming giant on Thursday is rolling out its cheapest membership tier, dubbed "Basic With Ads."
                          The new tier will cost $6.99 per month, which makes it a full $3 cheaper than Netflix's current
                          cheapest plan, the $9.99 Basic plan. It's Netflix's first foray into the ad-supported space — the
                          streamer has for years resisted putting any advertising on its platform. The company's plan arrives
                          on Nov. 3, a month before rival streaming service Disney+ will introduce its own ad-supported tier,
                          and competes with ad-supported plans from services like Hulu and Peacock. The plan's launch comes
                          as Netflix is preparing to crack down on password sharing on its platform. Beginning next year,
                          Netflix will push people who borrow accounts to create their own, and will also give
                          account-holders who share their passwords the ability to pay extra to have friends and family on
                          their accounts. Here's what you need to know about Netflix's Basic With Ads tier. The Basic With
                          Ads plan will operate similarly to the Basic plan. Users will have access to a 720p video stream —
                          versus the 1080p stream offered by the $15.49 Standard plan and the 4K plan offered by the $19.99
                          Premium plan — which can be accessed from any internet-connected device.

                          Like many of you, I find Netflix occupies my television screen about once every two weeks since I’m
                          not champing at the bit to experience a litany of identical documentaries focused on minor Twitter
                          story lines from the previous year. (Seriously, how the hell are there two GameStonk
                          documentaries?) In short, Netflix isn’t something I want to spend $240 on each year anymore — its
                          salad days are a distant memory — and the company is finally starting to empathize with my
                          reasoning. Basic With Ads is functionally identical to Netflix’s $10 Basic plan. You’re capped at a
                          720p resolution for all of your playback options and are allowed to use only one device on the
                          subscription at a time. (So no, you can’t engineer some sort of weird multi-apartment Bridgerton
                          marathon.) The only sacrifice you need to make to get the $3 discount is to sit through the four
                          minutes of total advertising time that occupied, say, season one, episode two of Stranger Things,
                          which I fired up on my Roku for a test-drive. (Yes, I’m a little late to the Upside Down party.)
                          The first thing I saw on my television was a dewy, luxurious promo for Louis Vuitton, which frankly
                          read as a pointed barb to my newfound money-saving mind-set. Yes, Netflix believes that even those
                          pivoting to Basic With Ads can afford the good life.

                          The fifth season of The Crown, which follows the life and reign of Queen Elizabeth II, was released
                          by Netflix on 9 November 2022. It was the first season of the series to be released following both
                          the death of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh on 9 April 2021 and the death of Queen Elizabeth II
                          on 8 September 2022. Imelda Staunton stars as Elizabeth, along with main cast members Jonathan

                          ensembles led by Claire Foy (seasons one and two) and Olivia Colman (seasons three and four). The
                          Crown traces the reign of Queen Elizabeth II from her wedding in 1947 through to the early 21st
                          century.[3] The fifth season covers the time period between 1991 and 1997, and is set during the
                          premiership of John Major.[4] Events depicted include Elizabeth's annus horribilis in 1992, Diana's
                          Panorama interview, the separation and divorce of Prince Charles and Diana, Elizabeth's state visit
                          to Russia, use of Prince Philip's DNA to identify the remains of the Romanov family, the
                          decommissioning of Britannia, the handover of Hong Kong, and Major's departure from office and the
                          beginning of Tony Blair's premiership.

                          Sure, all most of the characters are horrible people and on the verge of murdering each other
                          and/or getting murdered, but looking at the gorgeous scenery and luxurious hotel is not a crime and
                          100 percent safe. We can indulge at a distance, add the dream getaway to the Pinterest board, or
                          maybe even plan a budget-friendly trip of our own. The White Lotus season 2 was filmed on location
                          in Sicily, an Italian island region in the Mediterranean Sea, halfway across the world from the
                          Hawaii-set first season. But where exactly? Let me tell you. Exteriors were filmed in Taormina,
                          Palermo, Noto, and the neighboring Ionian Sea. This area of Italy has an active volcano, Mount
                          Etna—which we saw in the finale—and many local wineries. There’s a gorgeous castle you can tour
                          called the Palazzo Conte Federico. There’s also, I’m sure you can imagine, so much good food to
                          eat…even though the White Lotus guests ate at the hotel, with a few notable exceptions. When the Di

                          It’s the type of series that may make you second-guess any of your intended vacation plans. 2022
                          was truly the year when the wealthy were held accountable, at least in movies and television.
                          Between Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery, White Noise, and Triangle of Sadness, we got a ton of
                          great content that forced the upper class to have traumatic vacations. The pinnacle of this was the
                          second season of The White Lotus, which moved the miniseries to a luxurious new location in Italy.
                          Unfortunately for the characters, this had more in common with the Italian scenery of The Talented
                          Mr. Ripley than it did with Under The Tuscan Sun. As with the first season, the end of this trip is
                          teased at the very beginning, and it’s a violent one. Both seasons of The White Lotus take place at
                          individual locations in a luxury vacation resort chain. A multitude of guests (most of whom are
                          incredibly wealthy) interact with the staff and local residents, only to begin squabbling and
                          bringing up past issues. While the show’s brilliance stems from the inventive storytelling of
                          writer/director Mike White, it doesn’t hurt that the show has the budget and scale of an HBO
                          production. In order to make the series as authentic as possible, White and his production team
                          utilized several real locations in both seasons. The White Lotus has drawn critical acclaim due to
                          how close its satire feels to reality, and the believability extends to the filming locations
                          themselves.

Question 202              : which party controls the house after 2022 midterm elections?
Correct Answers         :  
                          Republican 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prediction (only positive):
  - Answer              : Democrats
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          Although election ‘red wave’ did not happen, GOP flipped enough seats to win slim majority in House
                          of Representatives. United States Republicans have regained control of the House of
                          Representatives, securing a narrow majority in a midterm election that saw the party fail to meet
                          expectations. The Associated Press declared Republican Mike Garcia the winner in California’s 27th
                          congressional district Wednesday, giving the GOP 218 seats, the threshold for the majority needed
                          to take over the lower chamber of Congress. Republican Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy will likely
                          become House speaker when the new Congress convenes early next year after his party nominated him
                          to the position on Tuesday. He will replace Democrat Nancy Pelosi who has held the gavel since
                          2019. Although the much-anticipated “red wave” of Republican victories did not materialise,
                          Republican candidates were able to gain at least five House seats in the November 8 midterms,
                          wiping out the Democrats’ thin majority. Democrats were able to flip a few districts, but they
                          suffered overall net losses, narrowly losing key races in New York, Florida and other states.
                          Redistricting after the 2020 Census had given conservatives an edge in several parts of the
                          country. Even with a less-than-ideal election performance, control of the House will allow
                          Republicans to halt President Joe Biden’s legislative agenda in its tracks. In the US, bills need
                          to pass in both the House and Senate and be approved by the president to become law.

Question 203              : Who won the U.S. Senate race in Nevada in the 2022 midterm elections?
Correct Answers         :

                          NevadaToday Nevada Election Survey Project poll finds 52% of Nevadans plan to vote for Cortez Masto
                          As Nevadans begin voting in the 2022 midterm election, a new University of Nevada, Reno poll of
                          likely voters released today finds Catherine Cortez Masto leading in the race for U.S. senator and
                          Steve Sisolak leading in the governor’s race. The governor’s race is within the margin of error,
                          but the senate race is not. The Nevada Election Survey Project 2022 general election poll, which
                          asked nearly 600 likely Nevada voters about their voting intentions and views on state and national
                          officials, found 52% of Nevadans plan to vote for Cortez Masto, 39% for Adam Laxalt and 5% remain
                          undecided. Cortez Masto’s large lead reflects less Republican voter enthusiasm for Laxalt’s
                          candidacy compared to Joe Lombardo and other Republican candidates. Among likely Republican voters,
                          74% said they planned to support Laxalt, compared to 83% for Lombardo and 88% for their Republican
                          House of Representatives candidate. More Republicans also plan to support Cortez Masto than other
                          Democrats on the ballot. Even if this sample of Nevadans is unusually supportive of the incumbent
                          senator, lower support among any likely Republican voters for Laxalt, in what others have polled as
                          a very tight race, is noteworthy.

                          and New Zealand. The music video, directed by Tim Pope, won the British Video of the Year at the
                          1990 Brit Awards. The meaning of "Lullaby" has been speculated by fans, including as a metonymy for
                          addiction, depression, or sexual assault,[2] and Smith has offered multiple explanations as to its
                          theme or content, such as childhood nightmares or abuse.[2] One explanation by Smith follows that
                          the song is about the disturbing songs his father sung to him as a kid, and the horrible ending
                          they would always have.[3] Tim Pope, a long-time collaborator of the Cure on many of its music
                          videos, interprets "Lullaby" as an allegory for lead singer Robert Smith's drug-addled past.[4]
                          Upon its release, "Lullaby" became the Cure's highest-charting hit in their home country when it
                          reached number five on the UK Singles Chart. It remains their only single to reach the top five in
                          the United Kingdom.

                          explained. "She’s young and cool. Wearing the cape and the tulle is reminiscent of wearing a gown
                          but has an ethereal quality that creates something grand and a sense of importance in that moment.
                          For the rehearsal dinner, she’ll swap out the cape for the jacket, which is a more tailored,
                          commanding clean look. We wanted to create a different moment and shift into the evening." For her
                          reception, Naomi changed into an ivory strapless silk gown designed by Reem Acra, which included
                          her grandmother Roberta Buhle’s pearls sewn into the train, and then slipped into a custom beaded
                          fringed mini dress by Markarian. She also wore tulle gloves, and her ceremony earrings. Naomi and
                          Peter became the first members of the President's family to tie the knot at 1600 Pennsylvania

                          second round of last year’s European Championship, France will look to get back on track and become
                          the first nation to repeat as World Cup champion since Pelé and Brazil did so in 1962. The French
                          have the talent to pull it off: Paris Saint-Germain forward Kylian Mbappé, a teenage prodigy four
                          years ago, has blossomed into a full-blown superstar, and the likes of Hugo Lloris, Raphael Varane
                          and Antoine Griezmann are still in the picture. But injuries to N’Golo Kante, Paul Pogba,
                          Christopher Nkunku and Karim Benzema will put France’s depth to the test. The group’s sentimental
                          favorite, however, is a Denmark team led by Manchester United playmaker Christian Eriksen — back on
                          the field and thriving after suffering a traumatizing cardiac arrest in the opening game of the
                          Danes’ Euro 2020 run. The group is rounded out by Tunisia and Australia, two teams that have
                          combined to make it past the group stage just once and have never won a knockout round game. Group

                          Group C of the 2022 FIFA World Cup took place from 22 to 30 November 2022.[1] The group consisted
                          of eventual champions Argentina, Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Poland. The top two teams, Argentina and
                          Poland, advanced to the round of 16. This marked the first time that Mexico did not advance past
                          the first round since 1978.[2] The teams were decided by the World Cup draw that took place on 1
                          April 2022.[3] The group was set to receive one team from each pot, which sorted all World Cup
                          teams by position on the FIFA World Rankings.[3] Notes The first match of the group was between
                          Argentina and Saudi Arabia. The two teams had faced each other four times prior to the tournament,
                          most recently in 2012, a 0–0 draw in a friendly game. Saudi Arabia defeated Argentina and ended
                          their 36-match unbeaten streak.[6] According to Gracenote, the win was the "most surprising" in
                          World Cup history, with many calling it one of the biggest World Cup upsets in history.[7] This was
                          also the second consecutive time that Argentina did not win their opening match at a World Cup,
                          after drawing 1–1 with Iceland in 2018; and the first time since 1990 that Argentina lost their
                          opening match.

                          "This is the biggest case we've ever had," Rossi says. On Sept. 9, Paramount announced the series
                          would be known as Criminal Minds: Evolution. The name seems like a good indication that the series
                          will be heading in a new direction. "The series never stopped evolving during its run, and we are
                          beyond excited to bring it back into a new era with new stories for a new generation of viewers at
                          Paramount+," said Nicole Clemens, Paramount+'s President of Original Scripted Series. "Erica
                          [Messner], the whole cast and creative team are building a season full of new twists that we are
                          sure will electrify audiences." It just wouldn't be the same without the familiar faces that we
                          came to know and love over the course of 15 seasons, so luckily most of them will be back for the
                          revival— not all of them, though, which we'll get to in a moment. Paramount+ announced Friday Night
                          Lights alum Zach Gilford as the first new cast member to be joining the series in a recurring role
                          throughout the season. Gilford is trading in his good-guy persona and will play Elias Voit, an
                          analyst for a cyber-security firm who has a dark side and an obsession with death. Unlike past
                          unsubs, Voit will be explored in an ongoing arc for 10 episodes. "To tell a slightly different
                          story [about this unsub] is really exciting," star Paget Brewster told journalists on Sept.

                          series will pick up where the original left off and is set in post-Covid-19 times. Unlike the cable

                          come up against their greatest threat yet, an unsub named Elias Voit who has used the pandemic to
                          build a network of other serial killers.

                          pic.twitter.com/rr9eerBvtW Rhule wouldn’t share specific plans about who he might be bringing along
                          with him, but said he would definitely be talking with — and listening to — players, coaches, and
                          staff before making changes. Coming off a big win on Black Friday, Huskers are most interested in
                          hearing about whether Interim Head Coach Mickey Joseph, who took the helm after Scott Frost was
                          fired, would be retained. “I reached out to Mickey right when I got the job. Looking forward to
                          talking to him at some point and talking to the rest of the staff. I’ve been on both sides of it,”
                          Rhule said. “I’ve been an assistant coach on a staff that’s been let go, and I’ve always
                          appreciated the coach coming in and talking to me. So I’ll try to be thorough with that process
                          over the next couple of days.” Alberts said the decision about whether to keep Joseph was entirely
                          in Rhule’s hands. “Ultimately, this is going to be Matt Rhule’s decision,” Alberts said. “He’s the
                          head coach and he needs to hire the 10 assistant head coaches he believes gives him the best
                          opportunity.” Rhule also talked Monday about his affinity for Nebraska. “My son is this YouTube
                          generation. I have seen the Tunnel Walk maybe 5,000 times.

                          New Head Football Coach Matt Rhule, live coverage right now on air @WOWT6News #Huskers
                          pic.twitter.com/rr9eerBvtW Rhule wouldn’t share specific plans about who he might be bringing along
                          with him, but said he would definitely be talking with — and listening to — players, coaches, and
                          staff before making changes. Coming off a big win on Black Friday, Huskers are most interested in
                          hearing about whether Interim Head Coach Mickey Joseph, who took the helm after Scott Frost was
                          fired, would be retained. “I reached out to Mickey right when I got the job. Looking forward to
                          talking to him at some point and talking to the rest of the staff. I’ve been on both sides of it,”
                          Rhule said. “I’ve been an assistant coach on a staff that’s been let go, and I’ve always
                          appreciated the coach coming in and talking to me. So I’ll try to be thorough with that process
                          over the next couple of days.” Alberts said the decision about whether to keep Joseph was entirely
                          in Rhule’s hands. “Ultimately, this is going to be Matt Rhule’s decision,” Alberts said. “He’s the
                          head coach and he needs to hire the 10 assistant head coaches he believes gives him the best
                          opportunity.” Rhule also talked Monday about his affinity for Nebraska. “My son is this YouTube
                          generation. I have seen the Tunnel Walk maybe 5,000 times.

  - Answer              : Margot Robbie

  - Source              :
                          It’s coming this summer Margot Robbie will officially play Barbie in an upcoming live-action film
                          that Warner Bros. and Mattel announced in 2019. The Oscar-nominated actress will also coproduce the
                          movie under her company, LuckyChap Entertainment, alongside husband Tom Ackerley and producer Josey
                          McNamara. This project will mark the first live-action film from the Barbie franchise, and the
                          first movie deal from Mattel Films, the film division of the company behind Barbie and other iconic
                          toys. Here’s what we know so far. “Since the first little girl ever existed, there have been
                          dolls,” a voice narrates in the opening shot in the first teaser trailer for Barbie, which came out
                          in December 2022. The camera pans over little girls sitting desolately in a desert. “But the dolls
                          were always and forever baby dolls, until …” Enter Robbie, who appears as a giant first iteration
                          of the Mattel doll from 1959, complete with a pin-up ponytail and a black-and-white striped
                          swimsuit. In a trailer released in April 2023, a firm plot for the film still seemed to be under
                          wraps, but there were hints at trouble in paradise for Barbie (Margot Robbie) and Ken (Ryan
                          Gosling). Barbie seems to want some independence and space, while Ken is being quite clingy. What
                          does this mean for the rest of the Barbie-verse!?

  - Source              :
                          Gosling has taken pride in having a "Ken-ergy that you can feel," and on The Tonight Show, he joked
                          about people "clutching their pearls" about the underwear-baring shots —"as though they ever
                          thought about Ken for a second before this!" (Meanwhile, his partner Eva Mendes joked that she
                          asked him to bring the Ken briefs home from set.) In April, Warner Bros. debuted a handful of
                          character posters, which gave more insight into who everyone from the cast was playing. The studio
                          also released the official poster for the film, which features Robbie and Gosling on the iconic
                          Barbie logo. The first teaser trailer for the Barbie movie dropped on Dec. 16, 2022. The 74-second
                          clip opens with little girls playing with baby dolls in a rugged setting. "Since the beginning of
                          time, since the first little girl ever existed, there have been dolls," the narrator can be heard
                          saying. "But the dolls were always and forever baby dolls. Until ..." The camera then cuts to
                          Robbie towering over the girls in a black-and-white striped bathing suit, black heels and white
                          sunglasses. In awe of Barbie, the girls decide to smash their baby dolls. Viewers then get a brief
                          look at the playful and colorful world of Barbie. On Dec. 17, 2022, Liu spoke to PEOPLE about the
                          clip and his experience making the film.

                          first movie deal from Mattel Films, the film division of the company behind Barbie and other iconic
                          toys. Here’s what we know so far. “Since the first little girl ever existed, there have been
                          dolls,” a voice narrates in the opening shot in the first teaser trailer for Barbie, which came out
                          in December 2022. The camera pans over little girls sitting desolately in a desert. “But the dolls
                          were always and forever baby dolls, until …” Enter Robbie, who appears as a giant first iteration
                          of the Mattel doll from 1959, complete with a pin-up ponytail and a black-and-white striped
                          swimsuit. In a trailer released in April 2023, a firm plot for the film still seemed to be under
                          wraps, but there were hints at trouble in paradise for Barbie (Margot Robbie) and Ken (Ryan
                          Gosling). Barbie seems to want some independence and space, while Ken is being quite clingy. What
                          does this mean for the rest of the Barbie-verse!?

Question 220              : Who is the captain of the USA soccer team in the FIFA Men's World Cup 2022?
Correct Answers         :  
                          Tyler Adams
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prediction (only positive):
  - Answer              : Tyler Adams
  - Threshold           : 0.8

                          Tyler Adams will captain the US men’s national team into the 2022 FIFA World Cup, head coach Gregg
                          Berhalter announced on the eve of Monday’s Group B opener vs. Wales (2 pm ET | FOX, Telemundo). The
                          Leeds United midfielder and New York Red Bulls homegrown product will be the USMNT’s youngest
                          captain since Walter Bahr at the 1950 World Cup. He’s already worn the armband nine times during 32
                          career international appearances. “We think he has great leadership capabilities,” Berhalter said
                          of the 23-year-old Wappingers Falls, New York native. “He leads by his actions and his words.” FIFA
                          requires teams to name a singular captain for the tournament; the USMNT were the last of 32
                          Qatar-qualified squads to complete that task. During Berhalter’s tenure, the USMNT have relied on a
                          leadership council and rotating armband responsibilities. Chelsea forward Christian Pulisic and
                          Nashville SC center back Walker Zimmerman were other leading candidates to be named captain. “A lot
                          of credit to my teammates,” Adams said, “because anyone throughout our leadership council can wear
                          that armband and represent us with pride and represent us in the right way." Adams debuted for the
                          Red Bulls in 2016 before moving to Europe in the winter of 2019, then to German Bundesliga side RB
                          Leipzig.

                          Other players in this squad have served as captain, but the role is a perfect fit for Adams. "I
                          thought it was brilliant," said center-back Tim Ream about Adams' astute handling of Monday's news
                          conference. "It's what it is. That's the world we're living in right now, and for him to handle it
                          with the poise that he did and the sincerity that he did, I think was fantastic for a 23-year-old."
                          Adams followed that up with the kind of impressive performance for the US that has become the norm,
                          putting in his usual robust shift in the center of midfield, and leading the Americans to a 1-0
                          victory over Iran that clinched passage to the knockout stage. Now a round-of-16 matchup against
                          the Netherlands awaits. "Tyler's a beast, man," US right-back Shaq Moore said. "He sets the tone
                          for us with the ball, without the ball, getting stuck in, intensity. He's a big part of our team.
                          I'm happy to have him." Leaders are made, not born, or so the saying goes. Certainly Adams'
                          parents, Melissa Russo and Daryl Sullivan, played a huge role in molding him into the person he is,
                          but he also played against older players throughout his youth career, and when he got to the New
                          York Red Bulls, drew inspiration from the captains he had there.

                          and retirees, a demonstration of commitment to labor just a week after a rupture over an imposed

                          elections have consequences than labor union leaders, who secured an $83 billion pension-fund
                          bailout in President Joe Biden's American Rescue Plan Act. "Without Joe Biden winning, and we won
                          the two Senate seats in Georgia and we were able to do reconciliation, none of this would’ve
                          happened," James P. Hoffa, the general president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters,
                          said in a telephone interview with NBC News. "The Republicans weren’t going to do it. The
                          Teamsters' Central States pension fund, covering nearly 400,000 workers and retirees, is the
                          marquee beneficiary of pension provisions attached to the larger relief bill. But labor leaders say
                          as many as 200 plans will be shored up, providing direct benefit to as many as 1.5 million people
                          in the short term, and many more overall. "That means the difference between eating and not eating,
                          and having a good retirement and one where you’re basically out there working trying to survive,"
                          Hoffa said. "The No. 1 priority, we've solved it." This account of the Teamsters' drive to save
                          retirement plans for millions of pensioners is drawn from interviews with several of the union's
                          officials, congressional sources and the public record. It begins with one Hoffa, the late
                          Teamsters chief James R. Hoffa, and the Central States pension fund he started.

                          player in college football. Here’s what you need to know: Williams was the best quarterback in
                          America this season, so the Maxwell Award was deserved. Williams led USC’s turnaround from a
                          four-win team to a top-10 squad in 2022 and elevated the players around him. Now his sights turn to
                          Saturday night and the Heisman Trophy. — Morales Duggan’s story has been one of the best in college
                          football, starting TCU’s season as the backup quarterback before leading the Horned Frogs to a 12-0
                          start. His toughness and perseverance helped pull the Frogs out of multiple second-half deficits
                          and without his poise, leadership and production late in games, TCU wouldn’t be in the College
                          Football Playoff. Winning the O’Brien and being a Heisman finalist are both well-deserved honors
                          for Duggan. — Khan Chuck Bednarik Award – Defensive Player of the Year Biletnikoff Award –

                          won.'" she said. "So, when she came to the stage and I sang that song, she understood that the

                          there to pick up the name." Steve Bahls was "thrilled" to hear Cheboi announced as 2022 CNN Hero of
                          the Year. "When I first met Nelly 10 years ago when she was a first-year Augustana student, I was
                          impressed with her determination to give back to her community," he said.

                          society, who startled many while delighting and informing many more with his uncompromising
                          perspective on social injustice and personal folly. “Adam Sandler has entertained audiences for
                          over three decades with his films, music, and his tenure as a fan favorite cast member on SNL,”
                          said Kennedy Center President Deborah F. Rutter about this year’s recipient. “Adam has created
                          characters that have made us laugh, cry, and cry from laughing. I am looking forward to a
                          laughter-filled evening like no other as we celebrate his career at a ceremony that is sure to
                          bring together the best in comedy.

                          Massachusetts, will serve as the next NCAA President, assuming the role effective March 2023. A
                          former collegiate athlete at Harvard, Governor Baker is credited with bringing bipartisan
                          leadership to the state, successfully guiding Massachusetts through an exceptionally turbulent
                          period for government officials. In addition to his two terms as Governor, he brings decades of

                          sectors. Governor Baker’s appointment marks the culmination of a comprehensive and inclusive
                          national search process, led by a subcommittee of the NCAA Board of Governors and TurnkeyZRG, the
                          top search firm in the space (which recently placed the commissioners of the ACC, Pac-12 and Big

                          Baker to the NCAA and eager for him to begin his work with our organization,” said Linda
                          Livingstone, President of Baylor University and Chair of the NCAA Board of Governors, who helmed
                          the presidential search committee. “Governor Baker has shown a remarkable ability to bridge divides
                          and build bipartisan consensus, taking on complex challenges in innovative and effective ways.

                          “I am honored to become the next president of the NCAA, an organization that impacts millions of
                          families and countless communities across this country every day,” said Governor Baker. “The NCAA
                          is confronting complex and significant challenges, but I am excited to get to work as the awesome
                          opportunity college athletics provides to so many students is more than worth the challenge. And
                          for the fans that faithfully fill stadiums, stands and gyms from coast to coast, I am eager to
                          ensure the competitions we all love to follow are there for generations to come. Over the coming
                          months, I will begin working with student-athletes and NCAA members as we modernize college sports
                          to suit today’s world, while preserving its essential value.” As the NCAA strives to enhance the
                          experience of the more than 500,000 young people that compete in college sports each year,
                          student-athletes’ input factored significantly in the development of the president’s job
                          description. “As a student-athlete representative on the search committee, I focused my
                          conversations with Governor Baker around many of the issues that student-athletes face today,” said
                          Isaiah Swann, a former baseball student-athlete at the University of Texas-Dallas and a current
                          second year MD-PhD student at the University of Virginia. “Throughout our discussions, he not only
                          demonstrated a command of the top issues confronting college sports but, more importantly, also
                          displayed empathy, open-mindedness, and a desire to better understand and address student-athletes’
                          perspectives.

                          businesses and other trends.[142] On February 11, 2015, Twitter announced that it had acquired

                          Square Enix has confirmed that the Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters, which are essentially upgraded
                          versions of Final Fantasy 1-6, will be released on Nintendo Switch and PS4 on April 19, 2023. The
                          Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters are currently available on PC and mobile, and soon a new audience
                          will be able to experience much of the history of the Final Fantasy franchise in a new way. If that
                          wasn't exciting enough, these versions come with a new pixel font, which seems to address one of
                          the biggest issues fans had with the games when they first were released - the questionable choice
                          of font by Square Enix for these remasters that left many unhappy. There will also be a new option
                          to switch between the original and new background music whenever you so choose, and there are more
                          options to adjust encounter rate, EXP, Gil, and ABP. All six games will be available on April 19 at
                          8am PT/11am ET/4pm BST, and fans will be able to purchase them individually or as a complete
                          package. On the eShop, the games range from $11.99-$17.99 per game, and all six can be purchased
                          for $74.99. For more, check out seven things you probably didn't know about Final Fantasy 1-3 and

                          Mexican filmmaker Guillermo del Toro's "Pinocchio" won the Academy Award for best animated feature
                          film on Sunday, the third Oscar of his career. The haunting stop-motion musical fantasy was
                          inspired by the 1883 Italian novel "The Adventures of Pinocchio" by Carlo Collodi, and informed by
                          Gris Grimly's illustrations of the 2002 edition of the book. Del Toro, 58, reimagines the classic
                          story of Pinocchio, a wooden puppet who dreams of being a real boy, who is cared for by carver
                          Geppetto. However, the story of the Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) film is set in Fascist Italy during the
                          interwar period and World War Two. "Pinocchio" prevailed over other popular nominees A24's
                          stop-motion film "Marcel the Shell With Shoes On" and the Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) 3D animated film
                          "Turning Red." Del Toro has many accolades, including his 2018 Oscar wins for best picture and best
                          director for "The Shape of Water.

                          observations may refine this. pic.twitter.com/FJ5IkTotaV Visualizations of the orbital data for
                          2022 YG show it taking an odd path around our planet, stretching into an elongated ellipse in one
                          direction, then migrating back to a more circular orbit and stretching out again in the other
                          direction before the whole cycle repeats itself. Watching the asteroid's projected path over a
                          period of a few centuries is oddly hypnotic in this visualization posted to YouTube. Previous "mini
                          moons" included asteroids 2020 CD3 and 2006 RH120, but both only stayed for a relatively short
                          time. More observations are needed to refine the apparent orbit of 2022 YG to see if it truly will
                          be with us deep into the next century. There have been mini-moon false alarms in the recent past.
                          An apparent new tiny satellite spotted in 2020 turned out to be a big hunk of space junk from a
                          1960s rocket launch instead.

                          than the amount of cloud storage) is that Microsoft 365 Basic doesn’t include access to the desktop
                          versions of Word, Excel, and PowerPoint apps. Basic subscribers will have to use the web or mobile
                          versions instead. “We know many people are using our services today, but some of them run out of
                          storage or want additional benefits that you don’t get with the free Microsoft 365 experience,”

                          in our comprehensive guide. Microsoft 365 has benefitted multiple people worldwide. Tools like
                          Microsoft Word are go-to solutions for many businesses, and students also gain significant value.
                          But despite Microsoft 365’s many benefits, some have perceived it not always to be the most
                          affordable tool. Now, however, that is changing. The company is kicking off 2023 with a $2 per
                          month Basic plan, and here’s everything you need to know. Whether you’re considering purchasing
                          Microsoft 365 for the first plan or you want to downgrade an existing subscription, knowing what
                          you get with Basic is a good idea. In the subsections below, we’ll cover the most important areas
                          of consideration. If you frequently use Microsoft 365’s products, you’ll want to ensure that you
                          have enough space in the cloud. And with Microsoft 365 Basic, you get precisely that. After
                          purchasing a Microsoft 365 Basic subscription, you can store up to 100 GB in your OneDrive cloud.
                          This should be more than enough for your Word documents, PowerPoint presentations, and so on. The
                          100 GB of storage is on par with Google One, which costs the same amount per month. Of course, you
                          probably want a premium Microsoft subscription to access all of the most important tools. And when
                          you sign up for Microsoft 365 Basic, you will get precisely that.

Question 241              : What was the annual GDP growth rate of the U.S. economy in 2022?

                          7 percent in the third quarter. GDP for 2022 Real GDP increased 2.1 percent in 2022 (from the 2021

                          The increase in real GDP in 2022 primarily reflected increases in consumer spending, exports,
                          private inventory investment, and nonresidential fixed investment that were partly offset by
                          decreases in residential fixed investment and federal government spending. Imports increased (table

                          reflected decreases in food and beverages as well as motor vehicles and parts that were partly
                          offset by increases in recreational goods and vehicles and "other" nondurable goods (mainly
                          pharmaceuticals). The increase in exports reflected increases in both goods and services. The
                          increase in private inventory investment primarily reflected increases in manufacturing, wholesale
                          trade, and retail trade industries. The increase in nonresidential fixed investment reflected
                          increases in intellectual property products (led by software) and in equipment (led by information
                          processing equipment) that were partly offset by a decrease in structures (led by commercial and
                          health care as well as power and communication structures).

                          Despite the uncertainty during the interim period in the wake of Shazam!'s massive success — having

                          wrapped, a trailer debuted and a release date has been set. Here's everything to know about Shazam!
                          Fury of the Gods. Shazam! Fury of the Gods wouldn't be possible without the return of its titular
                          character played by Zachary Levi. Plus, his teenage counterpart Billy Batson, played by Asher
                          Angel, will also be making his return. Other cast members set to reprise their roles include Jack
                          Dylan Grazer, Faithe Herman, Ian Chen, Jovan Armand and Grace Caroline Currey as Billy's foster

                          Kalypso. They are the primary villains in Shazam's second installment. Rachel Zegler, who starred
                          in Steven Spielberg's West Side Story remake, is also cast as their sister in the film, playing the
                          role of Athena, one of three goddess daughters of the Titan Atlas — of which the actress said "was
                          so much fun" to play.

                          Before being reborn by saying the magic word "Shazam," an acronym of the immortals Solomon,
                          Hercules, Atlas, Zeus, Achilles and Mercury, this muscled do-gooder in spandex was just a kid named
                          Billy Batson, played by Asher Angel. You remember Billy, a constant runaway from the Philadelphia
                          foster homes he's been forced to endure since his teen mom deserted him. Billy's foster bestie is
                          Freddy (the scene-stealing Jack Dylan Grazer), a kid on crutches with a smart mouth on him. Things
                          have changed for Billy and his orphaned buds -- Mary (Grace Caroline Currey), Eugene (Ian Chen),
                          Pedro (Jovan Armand) and Darla (a fab Faithe Herman) -- ever since the Wizard (Djimon Hounsou)
                          picked him as his successor. "Put your hands on my staff," demanded the Wiz. "Gross!" said Billy,
                          in a response that typified the script's "Deadpool"-lite irreverence. I'm pleased to report that
                          cheeky attitude still pops through in "Shazam! Fury of the Gods" as Billy/Shazam and his kid
                          besties, now in adult superhero bodies -- Adam Brody for Freddy, Meagan Good for Darla, Ross Butler
                          for Eugene, D.J. Cotrona for Pedro and Currey playing both versions of Mary -- take on their
                          greatest challenge yet.

                          TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew will testify for his first congressional hearing on Thursday, where he is
                          likely to face intense grilling from politicians from both parties who argue that the popular app,
                          which has 150 million U.S. users, cannot be trusted. Here’s a quick guide for what to know about
                          Chew, a 40-year-old Singaporean who interned at Facebook and studied at Harvard Business School
                          before becoming the public face of one of the most popular — and contentious — apps in the United
                          States. TikTok's CEO testifies before Congress. Follow our live updates. Chew was born and raised
                          in Singapore, the island nation in Southeast Asia that has become a prominent bridge for
                          international business between China and the West. “The thing about growing up on a small island …
                          is you get wanderlust at a very young age,” he said in an interview last year. After completing his
                          military service — mandatory for most male Singaporeans — he left to study economics at University
                          College London (UCL), a top British university, graduating in 2006 and working at investment bank
                          Goldman Sachs for two years. He then moved to the United States to get his master’s degree at
                          Harvard Business School. “I remember struggling with this decision,” he said in a speech to UCL
                          graduates in 2022, as he was unsure whether taking time to do the master’s degree “would enhance or
                          delay my career.

                          The Blacklist is hanging its hat up for good. After 10 years on NBC, it's time to say goodbye to
                          James Spader's Red Reddington and the rest of his criminal enterprise. The series will now end with
                          its 10th and final season, set to premiere Feb. 26. "After 10 years, hundreds of Blacklist cases
                          and more than 200 episodes produced, we're honored to reach our conclusion," showrunner and
                          executive producer John Eisendrath shared in the Feb. 1 announcement. "It's been incredibly fun to
                          create the strange, devious and delightful Blacklisters to challenge Raymond Reddington and our FBI
                          Task Force each week. We would like to thank everyone at NBC and Sony, our extraordinary crew who

                          remarkable cast who brought life to these characters. We appreciate our dedicated fanbase who came
                          along for this wonderful ride and are excited to share this final season with them." NBC paired the
                          news with a trailer for the upcoming season, which teased former Blacklisters returning for their
                          ultimate revenge. It also included a look back at the show's last decade since its September 2013
                          debut and even featured Megan Boone's Liz Keen. "When all this began, I was such a different
                          person. It's quite a story," Red stated in the clip. "When you love someone, you have no control.

Question 246              : What is the title of the AI-generated episode of Seinfeld?

  - Source              :
                          Jerry Seinfeld, trapped in algorithmically generated limbo Seinfeld was famously described as "a
                          show about nothing," and that description has become something of a prophecy, as a bizarre,
                          AI-generated Seinfeld episode has been streaming on Twitch for a full month, titled “Infinite
                          Nothing.” The never-ending episode is, as its title suggests, very much “about nothing,” as
                          algorithmically animated Seinfeld characters wander aimlessly around their apartment, engaging in
                          meandering, dreamlike conversations powered by OpenAI’s GPT-3 language model, with minimal human
                          moderation. In an interview with Vice, Skyler Hartle, the co-creator of “Nothing, Forever,”
                          explained the thinking behind the project: “The actual impetus for this was it originally started
                          its life as this weird, very, off-center kind of nonsensical, surreal art project,” Hartle said.
                          “But then we kind of worked over the years to bring it to this new place. And then, of course,
                          generative media and generative AI just kind of took off in a crazy way over the past couple of
                          years.” “Aside from the artwork and the laugh track you'll hear, everything else is generative,
                          including: dialogue, speech, direction (camera cuts, character focus, shot length, scene length,
                          etc), character movement, and music,” one of the creators wrote in a Reddit comment.

                          Unfortunately for the show, that unexpected nature can be a double-edged sword regarding AI trained
                          on data scraped from the Internet. According to Vice, late Sunday night, the AI-generated clone of
                          Jerry Seinfeld (called "Larry Feinberg" in the AI show) went on a brief transphobic rant. Here's a
                          transcript: There’s like 50 people here and no one is laughing. Anyone have any suggestions? I’m
                          thinking about doing a bit about how being transgender is actually a mental illness. Or how all
                          liberals are secretly gay and want to impose their will on everyone. Or something about how
                          transgender people are ruining the fabric of society. But no one is laughing, so I’m going to stop.
                          Thanks for coming out tonight. See you next time. Where’d everybody go? In a Discord post from the
                          channel's creators, the malfunction occurred because of an outage from OpenAI's higher-cost (and
                          better-behaved) text-davinci-003 model led the creators to fall back to the lower-cost (and less
                          complex) text-curie-001 model to keep the show running. "The switch to Curie was what resulted in
                          the inappropriate text being generated," wrote an admin on the show's Discord channel. "We leverage
                          OpenAI’s content moderation tools, which have worked thus far for the Davinci model, but were not
                          successful with Curie.

                          test of sorts. Have you ever asked yourself, “What would an episode of Seinfeld look like if George
                          had to call out sick from work?” Honestly, you probably haven’t. But we here at Workforce.com have.
                          So we generated this never before seen script detailing how the incompetent egomaniacs of Seinfeld
                          would deal with calling out of work in the least effective and least honorable way possible. While

                          call out of work?” “How do my employees track their sick days?” “Was Seinfeld ever really that

                          It’s also impossible to know yet whether certain counties are seeing a disproportionate share of
                          applications since the LSA analysis also noted only 57 of Iowa’s 99 counties had a certified
                          private school. That had been a concern of even some Republican lawmakers who worried the voucher
                          system would disproportionately hurt rural areas. Governor Kim Reynolds made the school choice law
                          a focal point of last November’s election and this year’s legislative session, signing the bill
                          into the law within the first weeks of the session. “I believe that school choice will improve our
                          overall education experience in Iowa,” Reynolds told TV9 in a statement on the application data. “I
                          believe it will create a system of schools, both public and private, that are driven by
                          student-centered missions. Iowans are hungry for Educational Freedom and the application numbers
                          are a reflection of that.” While Gov. Reyolds touted the program as empowering parental choice in
                          education, critics argued it took state funding away from public schools with public oversight and
                          handed it over to private schools with less public accountability on how those funds are used. The
                          ESA provides nearly $7,600 in state funding to each student who enrolls in a private school to pay
                          for tuition to attend that school, as well as other approved educational expenses like tutoring.
                          The funds cannot be used for school supplies, textbooks or college tuition and any unspent funding
                          would be returned to the state once the student graduates high school or turns 20 years old.

Question 249              : What is Google's new AI chatbot called?

                          Advertisement Supported by The internet giant will grant users access to a chatbot after years of
                          cautious development, chasing splashy debuts from rivals OpenAI and Microsoft. By Nico Grant and
                          Cade Metz Nico Grant and Cade Metz reported this story in San Francisco. For more than three
                          months, Google executives have watched as projects at Microsoft and a San Francisco start-up called
                          OpenAI have stoked the public’s imagination with the potential for artificial intelligence. But on
                          Tuesday, Google tentatively stepped off the sidelines as it released a chatbot called Bard. The new
                          A.I. chatbot will be available to a limited number of users in the United States and Britain and
                          will accommodate additional users, countries and languages over time, Google executives said in an
                          interview. The cautious rollout is the company’s first public effort to address the recent chatbot
                          craze driven by OpenAI and Microsoft, and it is meant to demonstrate that Google is capable of
                          providing similar technology. But Google is taking a much more circumspect approach than its
                          competitors, which have faced criticism that they are proliferating an unpredictable and sometimes
                          untrustworthy technology. Still, the release represents a significant step to stave off a threat to
                          Google’s most lucrative business, its search engine. Many in the tech industry believe that Google
                          — more than any other big tech company — has a lot to lose and to gain from A.I.

                          As the technology goes mainstream, though, one company will be able to take some credit for its
                          ascendancy: a 10-person research lab named Midjourney, which makes an eponymous AI image generator
                          accessed through a Discord chat server. Although the name might be unfamiliar, you’ve probably seen
                          the output from Midjourney’s system floating about your social media feeds already. To generate
                          your own, you just join Midjourney’s Discord, type a prompt, and the system makes an image for you.
                          Midjourney exists on Discord because “people want to make things together” “A lot of people ask us,
                          why don’t you just make an iOS app that makes you a picture?” Midjourney’s founder, David Holz,
                          told The Verge in an interview. “But people want to make things together, and if you do that on
                          iOS, you have to make your own social network. And that’s pretty hard. So if you want your own
                          social experience, Discord is really great.” Sign up for a free account, and you get 25 credits,

                          you. This week, though, Midjourney is expanding access to its model, allowing anyone to create
                          their own Discord server with their own AI image generator.

  - Source              :
                          Jason Allen, who wrote the prompt that led Midjourney to generate the image, printed the image onto
                          a canvas and entered it into the competition using the name "Jason M. Allen via Midjourney". Other
                          digital artists were upset by the news.[18] Allen was unapologetic, insisting that he followed the
                          competition's rules. The two category judges were unaware that Midjourney used AI to generate
                          images, although they later said that had they known this, they would have awarded Allen the top
                          prize anyway.[28] In December 2022, Midjourney was used to create the images in an AI-generated
                          children's book in the span of a weekend. Titled Alice and Sparkle, the book features a young girl
                          who builds a robot that becomes self-aware. The creator, Ammaar Reeshi, spent hours tweaking
                          Midjourney prompts, rejecting hundreds of generated results to ultimately choose 13 illustrations
                          for the book.[29] Both the product and process drew criticism: "the main problem... is that it was
                          trained off of artists’ work. It’s our creations, our distinct styles that we created, that we did
                          not consent to being used," one artist wrote.[30] In 2023, the realism of AI-based text-to-image
                          generators, such as Midjourney, DALL-E, or Stable Diffusion,[31][32] reached such a high level that
                          it led to a significant wave of viral AI-generated photos.

                          7] In May 2012, Microsoft announced another redesign of its search engine that includes "Sidebar",
                          a social feature that searches users' social networks for information relevant to the search
                          query.[8] The BitFunnel search engine indexing algorithm and various components of the search
                          engine were made open source by Microsoft in 2016.[9][10] In February 2023, Microsoft introduced
                          Bing Chat, an artificial intelligence chatbot experience based on GPT-4, integrated into the search
                          engine. Bing reached 100 million active users the following month. As of March 2023[update],
                          (Microsoft) Bing is the second largest search engine globally, with a query volume of 12%, behind
                          Google's 79%; Baidu is at 5% and Yahoo! Search, which Bing largely powers, has 2%.[11][12]
                          Microsoft launched MSN Search in the third quarter of 1998, using search results from Inktomi. It
                          consisted of a search engine, index, and web crawler. In early 1999, MSN Search launched a version
                          which displayed listings from Looksmart blended with results from Inktomi except for a short time
                          in 1999 when results from AltaVista were used instead. Microsoft decided to make a large investment
                          in web search by building its own web crawler for MSN Search, the index of which was updated weekly
                          and sometimes daily.

                          New Pinterest (PINS) CEO Bill Ready is staying focused on the mission at hand despite a tough
                          reaction by the market to fourth-quarter results and first-quarter guidance. "Our mission is to go
                          build a positive platform where users can find the inspiration to build a life they love, and we're
                          seeing really great progress on that," Ready told Yahoo Finance Live (video above). "The best
                          evidence of that is we grew engagement with users by double-digit percentage points, and we have
                          returned to user growth." Ready, who took over as CEO in June 2022 after a career spanning the
                          likes of PayPal and Google, stated he is focused on making Pinterest a more "shoppable" platform to
                          drive sales — tapping into his experience in commerce at the aforementioned tech giants. Those
                          efforts, coupled with fresh cost cuts, are expected to drive margin expansion this year for
                          Pinterest in the face of a challenging ad sales market. Despite the progress on Pinterest's
                          transformation, the stock fell 5% on Tuesday following a soft first-quarter outlook due to the
                          economic-fueled ad market challenges tripping up social media players like Meta (META), Snap
                          (SNAP), and Twitter. Here is how Pinterest performed compared to Wall Street estimates: 4Q22 Net
                          Sales: $877.2 million vs. $887.2 million Adjusted EPS: $0.29 vs. $0.27 Monthly Active Users (MAUs):

                          Most recently, Bill was President of Commerce, Payments & Next Billion Users at Google. Before
                          that, he was Chief Operating Officer at PayPal, and CEO of both Braintree and Venmo. At his core,
                          Bill is a builder. He has led small startups and global organizations. He deeply understands
                          commerce and payments. And, he shares our passion for creating a positive corner on the internet—a
                          place that enriches your real life instead of distracting you from it. As you can imagine, this was
                          a hard decision. So much of my heart belongs to Pinterest. I guess you could call it a founder’s
                          love. And, when you care about something so much, the natural instinct is to hold it as tight as
                          you can. But often, the most loving thing to do is let it go and watch it flourish in new ways.
                          That’s what is going to happen with Bill at the helm. I’m not leaving. Being executive chairman
                          will let me focus on what I love: meeting Pinners, nurturing new products, and advising on
                          long-term strategy. My new role reminds me a bit of what I did in the early days. When we started
                          Pinterest, it was more art project than business. I knew most Pinners by their first name. We
                          obsessed over every pixel, feature, and word in our product. I posted my cell phone number on our
                          website to show there was a real person who cared about every user. Thank goodness for unlimited

                          Pikmin 4 is so close to lanching on the Nintendo Switch, and here's when fans can expect to jump
                          into the digital version. Pikmin 4 is set to launch for the Nintendo Switch on July 21 and marks
                          the newest numbered entry in the real-time strategy series in over ten years, making its release
                          quite the big deal for hardcore fans. Instead of playing as Captain Olimar (who most people know
                          from Super Smash Bros. at this point) or any of his space explorer comrades, gamers will get to
                          customize their own character (a series first). There are not too many options available, but it's
                          still a step forward in terms of a character creator in a Nintendo first-party title. Pikmin 4
                          comes out in a couple of days and retails for $59.99, the same price as most other major games on
                          the Switch. People who decided to pre-order the game digitally via the Switch eShop are probably
                          wondering just when they'll be able to actually boot the game and start playing --that's where this
                          guide comes into play. RELATED: Pikmin 4 Fans Are Paying for Ads of the Game to Appear Over Time
                          Square Before we get into it, it's worth pointing out that this is the expected release time for
                          Pikmin 4 --it has not been officially confirmed by Nintendo just yet.

                          This fourth entry has been a long time coming, with Shigeru Miyamoto saying back in 2015 that it
                          was “very close to completion.” Seven years later, it’s finally set to release in July. This
                          installment introduces a new Ice Pikmin that can freeze enemies and the environment to help your
                          alien flora navigate the strange planet they find themselves on. The plants aren’t alone this time
                          around, either, as they get help from a rotund dog called Oatchi, who can smash through barriers
                          and carry Pikmin on its back while swimming across ponds and puddles. Overall, it looks like good
                          fun for fans of the series or anyone interested in picking up a colorful, cartoonish strategy game.

                          Super Bowl LVII was an American football game played to determine the champion of the National
                          Football League (NFL) for the 2022 season. The American Football Conference (AFC) champion Kansas
                          City Chiefs defeated the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Philadelphia Eagles, 38–35.
                          The game was played on February 12, 2023, at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. It was the
                          fourth Super Bowl hosted by the Phoenix metropolitan area, and the third at this venue, with the
                          most recent previously being Super Bowl XLIX in 2015 (then known as University of Phoenix
                          Stadium).[6] Both teams finished the regular season with a league-best 14–3 record. This was the
                          Eagles fourth Super Bowl appearance overall and the second in the last six seasons, having
                          previously won Super Bowl LII; the Eagles previously lost Super Bowls XV and XXXIX. This was the
                          Chiefs' fifth Super Bowl appearance overall and third in the last four seasons, having previously
                          won Super Bowls IV and LIV, and losses in Super Bowls I and LV. After the Eagles went into halftime
                          up 24–14, the Chiefs mounted a comeback to win the game 38–35 with a game-winning field goal kicked
                          by Harrison Butker. Butker's game winning kick was set up by a pivotal and controversial defensive
                          holding call on Philadelphia cornerback James Bradberry, which was criticized by some observers but
                          supported by others.

                          Milton Williams (4 sacks). Pro Bowl linebacker Haason Reddick ranked second in the NFL with 16
                          sacks while forcing five fumbles and recovering three. Linebackers T. J. Edwards and Kyzir White
                          each recorded over 100 combined tackles and broke up seven passes. In the secondary, safety C. J.
                          Gardner-Johnson co-led the NFL with six interceptions, while All-Pro cornerbacks Darius Slay and
                          James Bradberry each had three.[44] It was Philadelphia's fourth Super Bowl, following a win in
                          Super Bowl LII and losses in Super Bowls XV and XXXIX. The Eagles also won three pre-Super Bowl NFL
                          championships in 1948, 1949, and 1960.[45] The Chiefs entered the playoffs as the No. 1 seed in the
                          AFC. They defeated the Jacksonville Jaguars, 27–20, in the AFC Divisional round. In a tightly
                          contested game, the Chiefs held off a late fourth-quarter rally by the Jaguars. Chiefs quarterback
                          Patrick Mahomes went down early in the game with a high right ankle sprain injury which forced him
                          out of the game for a drive, but he was able to return shortly after leaving.

                          the group’s album Glitch Mode peaked at No. 50 on the Billboard 200 album chart. NCT 127’s latest
                          album, 2 Baddies, peaked at No. 3 on the Billboard 200 in October. Although SM Entertainment’s
                          largest source of revenue, recorded music, declined 3.7% in 2022, gains in other parts of the
                          business made up for the loss: Concerts jumped tenfold from a pandemic-led slowdown, licensing
                          climbed 62.2% and appearances jumped 48.1%. In the fourth quarter, SM Entertainment’s revenue rose
                          7.7% to 256.4 billion won ($188.6 million at the quarter's average exchange rate). Operating profit

                          prior-year period. Net profit fell 72.7% due in part to the sale of real estate in the fourth
                          quarter of 2021 for 19.7 billion won ($14.5 million). The company also experienced 7.5 billion won
                          ($5.5 million) of foreign-currency-related loss in the quarter.

  - Source              :
                          Given my background as a senior value engineer, I made the obvious leap: Could what they do to
                          train these llamas help us provide a better, more reliable patient experience? After we got home, I
                          called the owner of Wilderness Ridge Llamas to learn how the llamas were trained. The boss told me:
                          If you can’t do it right, don’t do it at all. If you can’t spend all the time training, it won’t be
                          worth it. These were the key principles they used to train the llamas. And while humans may be a
                          long way from llamas in the phylogenetic tree, the principles might work for us, too. Whether
                          llamas or people, you get a reliable experience by training right: Apply these principles to your
                          learners: Every person—and every llama—is different. My llama needed a firmer hand than my son’s.
                          When they train the llamas, they take that into account. They train baby llamas differently than
                          older llamas. They provide a different level of attention and set lower expectations. We can apply
                          that to people, too. Not everyone has the same knowledge or the same skill set. That’s why I like
                          to find out who’s going to be in a class I am teaching. We need to understand people’s backgrounds
                          and where they are coming from so we can present material in the appropriate way. Is the audience
                          medical students or physicians?

                          The film’s win came with clear overtones to Navalny’s ongoing imprisonment and Vladimir Putin’s
                          continued war in Ukraine. Yulia Navalnaya joined the filmmakers on the stage. “My husband is in
                          prison just for telling the truth,” said Navalnaya. “Stay strong, my love.” Some big names weren’t
                          in attendance for other reasons. Neither Tom Cruise, whose “Top Gun: Maverick” was up for best
                          picture, nor James Cameron, director of best-picture nominee “Avatar: The Way of Water,” were at
                          the ceremony. Both have been forefront in Hollywood’s efforts to get moviegoers back after years of
                          pandemic. “The two guys who asked us to go back to theater aren’t in the theater,” said Kimmel, who
                          added that Cruise without his shirt on in “Top Gun: Maverick” was “L. Ron Hubba Hubba.” Blockbuster
                          nominees typically help boost Oscar ratings. Neither “Maverick” or “Avatar” — with some $3.7
                          billion in combined box office — took home much, though. “The Way of Water” won for visual effects;
                          “Maverick” took best sound. After last year’s Oscars, which had stripped some categories from being
                          handed out in the live telecast, the academy restored all awards to the show and leaned on
                          traditional song and and dance numbers.

  - Source              :
                          Andrea Riseborough's Best Actress nomination for To Leslie was controversial amongst critics and
                          pundits, as Momentum Pictures, the film's distributor, did not fund a conventional
                          advertising-driven awards campaign for the film. Instead, director Michael Morris and his wife,
                          actress Mary McCormack, organized a "celeb-backed campaign" to get Riseborough nominated.[41][42]
                          They contacted friends and colleagues in the entertainment industry, asking them to view the film
                          and share it with others if they enjoyed it.[43] Morris and Riseborough also hired publicists to
                          coordinate the efforts. While not initially regarded as a serious contender, the campaign raised
                          Riseborough's profile; dozens of celebrities praised her performance on social media, and some
                          hosted screenings of the film during voting for the Academy Award nominations in January
                          2023.[44][45] Riseborough's nomination was announced on January 24, which the Los Angeles Times
                          called "one of the most shocking nominations in Oscar history".[43] After her nomination was

                          lobbying voters.[46] A post on the film's Instagram account was noted by several AMPAS members for
                          possibly violating a rule prohibiting "[singling] out 'the competition' by name" by featuring a
                          quote from film critic Richard Roeper, who praised Riseborough's performance as better than Cate
                          Blanchett's in Tár, a fellow nominee for Best Actress.

                          works. The YouTube TV channels package is very simple — there's a single base plan, with more than
                          85 channels. Given how expensive live TV streaming services are compared to their standard
                          video-on-demand counterparts, it's definitely worth looking into what each service offers, and here
                          you'll find out everything you need to know about YouTube TV. Not to be confused with video-sharing
                          site YouTube, its paid version YouTube Premium, YouTube Short, YouTube Music or anything else: the
                          TV option is a cable-cutting plan available in the US for people who want to watch cable channels
                          but without that kind of subscription. YouTube TV offers plenty of cable channels, versatile
                          expansions and a clean UI but at a reasonable price, making it a favorite among live TV streaming
                          fans. So, if you're considering YouTube TV as your streaming solution of choice, it's most
                          definitely worth a look. Peruse the many subscription packages YouTube TV offers. It won't take
                          long. There is just one base price plan for YouTube TV. That's it. And that's a good thing. Here's
                          everything you need to know about YouTube TV. As of March 16, YouTube TV costs $72.99 a month.

                          offers a niche channel lineup). Like we said, we still really like Hulu + Live TV for its on-demand

                          entertainment, sports, and news channels doesn’t look much different than a basic cable
                          package—until you notice the lack of filler. There’s no cable-package bloat like audio-only music
                          or shopping networks (except for QVC), just a tight lineup of popular channels like Comedy Central,
                          Paramount Network, MTV, AMC, Cartoon Network, ESPN, Disney Channel, FS1, FX, Syfy, TNT, USA
                          Network, etc. YouTube TV trims the cable fat nicely.

                          The twenty-third season of the American reality television series The Voice premiered on March 6,
                          2023, on NBC.[1][2] The season is presented by Carson Daly, who returned for his twenty-third
                          season as host. The panel of coaches for the season consists of Blake Shelton, who returned for his
                          twenty-third and final season as a coach; returning coach Kelly Clarkson, who returned for her
                          ninth season after a one-season hiatus; and debuting coaches Chance the Rapper and Niall Horan.[3]
                          Gina Miles was named as the winner of the season, with the closest margin to-date, on the season
                          finale that aired on May 23, 2023. Her victory marks Niall Horan's first win as a coach, with Horan
                          becoming the third new coach, after Clarkson and John Legend, to win on his debut season, as well
                          as the youngest coach to win a season. On October 11, 2022, NBC announced that the show would be
                          returning for a twenty-third season to be aired in spring 2023.[4][5] Previously, it was announced
                          that, beginning with the 2021–22 United States network television schedule, only one season would
                          be produced per cyclical year,[6] though it was reported that this decision was reversed upon the
                          announcement of the season.[7] Later, it was announced that the season would air on March 6.

                          finale that aired on May 23, 2023. Her victory marks Niall Horan's first win as a coach, with Horan
                          becoming the third new coach, after Clarkson and John Legend, to win on his debut season, as well
                          as the youngest coach to win a season. On October 11, 2022, NBC announced that the show would be
                          returning for a twenty-third season to be aired in spring 2023.[4][5] Previously, it was announced
                          that, beginning with the 2021–22 United States network television schedule, only one season would
                          be produced per cyclical year,[6] though it was reported that this decision was reversed upon the
                          announcement of the season.[7] Later, it was announced that the season would air on March 6.

Question 269              : What is the name of Elon Musk's new AI company?
Correct Answers         :  
                          X.AI, xAI

  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          Twitter owner Elon Musk has founded a new artificial intelligence company named X.AI, according to
                          a Nevada business filing from last month. The filing, dated March 9, lists Musk as the company’s
                          sole director and Jared Birchall, who manages Musk’s family office, as its secretary. Musk has been
                          publicly skeptical of the future of artificial intelligence in the past and has even called for a
                          complete AI development pause, citing “risks to society” he says the technology poses. “Recent
                          months have seen AI labs locked in an out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful
                          digital minds that no one – not even their creators – can understand, predict, or reliably
                          control,” a group of tech experts including Musk said in an open letter calling for the development
                          pause last month. In an interview with Fox News’s Tucker Carlson that will air next week, Musk
                          warned that “AI is more dangerous than, say, mismanaged aircraft design or production maintenance
                          or bad car production.” “In the sense that it has the potential — however small one may regard that
                          probability, but it is non-trivial — it has the potential of civilization destruction,” he said.
                          Musk was a co-founder of OpenAI, one of the leading artificial intelligence firms, but left the
                          company in 2018 after a reported internal power struggle. He has reportedly sought to build a rival

                          was dissolved as a company this week and was replaced by a new company Musk calls X. The move is
                          seen as an attempt to build a social media platform that also allows payments, turning it into “the
                          everything app,” akin to how apps like WeChat work in China. Twitter announced this week it was
                          partnering with eToro to allow users to be able to trade stocks and crypto. It should be pretty
                          clear by now that Musk’s call for a six-month pause was purely out of self interest in the AI arms
                          race, as I wrote at the time. ChatGPT has become a fascinating tool for people who want to
                          experiment with large language models (LLMs) that answer questions posed in natural language. But
                          there are still a lot of kinks to be worked out, as ChatGPT will often give confident answers, even
                          when it’s wrong. AI is largely a magic trick at this point, sometimes spouting nonsense that users
                          may not know enough about to fact-check. But it’s an interesting magic trick and it’s something
                          that will improved upon as more people in the world of tech become involved. Musk must know he’s
                          behind in the most exciting development on the web since social media went mainstream in the late
                          2000s. But the billionaire clearly doesn’t intend to stay behind for long.

                          Twitter owner Elon Musk has founded a new artificial intelligence company named X.AI, according to
                          a Nevada business filing from last month. The filing, dated March 9, lists Musk as the company’s
                          sole director and Jared Birchall, who manages Musk’s family office, as its secretary. Musk has been
                          publicly skeptical of the future of artificial intelligence in the past and has even called for a
                          complete AI development pause, citing “risks to society” he says the technology poses. “Recent
                          months have seen AI labs locked in an out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful
                          digital minds that no one – not even their creators – can understand, predict, or reliably
                          control,” a group of tech experts including Musk said in an open letter calling for the development
                          pause last month. In an interview with Fox News’s Tucker Carlson that will air next week, Musk
                          warned that “AI is more dangerous than, say, mismanaged aircraft design or production maintenance
                          or bad car production.” “In the sense that it has the potential — however small one may regard that
                          probability, but it is non-trivial — it has the potential of civilization destruction,” he said.
                          Musk was a co-founder of OpenAI, one of the leading artificial intelligence firms, but left the
                          company in 2018 after a reported internal power struggle. He has reportedly sought to build a rival
                          to OpenAI, recruiting artificial intelligence engineers for a new venture for months.

                          9 yards per carry for the Maroon squad, running through some decent holes produced by most of the
                          first-team offensive line. “To me, that’s the one area that we had to improve in,” Pry said. “We
                          have to be able to run the football. It really helps everything else. With our offense, with our
                          defense. If we can run the ball, that to me is 100-level foundational stuff. And we’re getting
                          better there. “I think we’ve got a pretty good group up front on defense. We’ve got some old heads
                          at d-tackle that have got some weight on them, can press gaps and do things, and we were still able
                          to get some movement on them guys. So it’s a work in progress, but again, I think the O-line’s
                          improved, I think the running backs are better. I like what’s happening in that room. Still got a
                          ways to go.” Nice write up on the game and the team. Enjoyed it. thanks Mid-May should be
                          interesting to see who hits the portal. kinda smh as to why qb’s didn’t get a chance to run with
                          1’s/maroon at least for a series… kinda disservice to drones for sure Soooo….I didn’t get to watch

                          to see the development of Grant Wells and the capabilities of Kyron Drones at the quarterback
                          position. Wells finished 12-of-18 for 148 passing yards (66.7%) and a TD. He had 3 rushes for 10
                          yards and a rushing touchdown. Notably, Wells threw 6 passes that were gains of 16-or-more yards.
                          The incumbent starter mostly linked up with the Gosnell brothers (Stephen and Benji) and Tucker
                          Holloway. Wells executed his plays and limited the risky elements of his playstyle. It also helps
                          that he inherited the more stable offensive line, which once again benefited his performance.

                          In August 2015, Apple revamped the online storefront, removing the dedicated "Store" tab and making
                          the entire website a retail experience.[66][67] Jobs believed the Apple retail program needed to
                          fundamentally change the relationship to the customer, and provide more control over the
                          presentation of Apple products and the Apple brand message. Jobs recognized the limitations of
                          third-party retailing and began investigating options to change the model.[4] In 1999, Jobs
                          personally recruited Millard Drexler, former CEO of Gap Inc., to serve on Apple's board of
                          directors.[4][68][69] In 2000, Jobs hired Ron Johnson from Target. The retail and development teams
                          headed by Allen Moyer from The Walt Disney Company then began a series of mock-ups for the Apple
                          Store inside a warehouse near the company's Cupertino headquarters.[4] On May 15, 2001, Jobs hosted
                          a press event at Apple's first store, located at the Tysons Corner Center mall in Tysons, Virginia,
                          near Washington, D.C.[70] The store officially opened on May 19, along with another store in
                          Glendale Galleria in Glendale, California.[70][4][71] More than 7,700 people visited Apple's first
                          two stores in the opening weekend, spending a total of US$599,000.[72] Several publications and
                          analysts predicted the failure of Apple Stores.

                          So, so much AI Google I/O 2023 was held on May 10. While many of the talks and presentations at I/O
                          are developer focused, the event started, as always, with a flashy keynote address to let us all
                          know what Google's been up to lately. This year, that includes both hardware and software — and, as
                          you might imagine, lots and lots of talk about AI. Here's everything you need to know. At I/O,
                          Google not only fully revealed its next midrange phone, the Pixel 7a, but also surprise-announced
                          that the phone is available to purchase — not preorder — right now, for $499. The phone shares a
                          lot of DNA with the $600 Pixel 7, including its Tensor G2 chipset, eight gigs of RAM, and design,
                          which is nearly indistinguishable from its more expensive cousin. If you're interested to learn
                          more, we've got a full review for you to check out. Interestingly, the Pixel 6a will remain on
                          offer at a lower price point: $350. As anticipated, Google showed off its first foldable at I/O
                          this year. The Pixel Fold's got a refreshingly normal-looking 5.8" screen on the outside and a 7.6"
                          display (with some pretty substantial bezels) on the inside.

                          core of Android Police’s content. He has been covering tech news and reviewing devices since
                          joining Android Police as a news writer in 2019. He lives in Berlin, Germany. Manuel studied Media
                          and Culture studies in Düsseldorf, finishing his university career with a master's thesis titled
                          "The Aesthetics of Tech YouTube Channels: Production of Proximity and Authenticity." His background
                          gives him a unique perspective on the ever-evolving world of technology and its implications on
                          society. He isn't shy to dig into technical backgrounds and the nitty-gritty developer details,
                          either. Manuel's first steps into the Android world were plagued by issues. After his HTC One S
                          refused to connect to mobile internet despite three warranty repairs, he quickly switched to a
                          Nexus 4, which he considers his true first Android phone. Since then, he has mostly been faithful
                          to the Google phone lineup, though these days, he is also carrying an iPhone in addition to his
                          Pixel phone.

                          So, so much AI Google I/O 2023 was held on May 10. While many of the talks and presentations at I/O
                          are developer focused, the event started, as always, with a flashy keynote address to let us all
                          know what Google's been up to lately. This year, that includes both hardware and software — and, as
                          you might imagine, lots and lots of talk about AI. Here's everything you need to know. At I/O,
                          Google not only fully revealed its next midrange phone, the Pixel 7a, but also surprise-announced
                          that the phone is available to purchase — not preorder — right now, for $499. The phone shares a
                          lot of DNA with the $600 Pixel 7, including its Tensor G2 chipset, eight gigs of RAM, and design,
                          which is nearly indistinguishable from its more expensive cousin. If you're interested to learn
                          more, we've got a full review for you to check out. Interestingly, the Pixel 6a will remain on
                          offer at a lower price point: $350. As anticipated, Google showed off its first foldable at I/O
                          this year. The Pixel Fold's got a refreshingly normal-looking 5.8" screen on the outside and a 7.6"
                          display (with some pretty substantial bezels) on the inside.

                          Mirakyan's interest in an app like his, however, seems to go deeper than Lloyd's term paper
                          comparison. Speaking to WaPo, he explained that he's always had a difficult time reading social
                          cues — a dating stressor that a tool like YourMove.ai helps to alleviate. "There's such a gap
                          currently," he told the newspaper, "in what people like myself want to communicate and how it comes
                          across." That's sympathetic, in a sense, and we could see how AI assistance might benefit folks who
                          have a tough time socially. At the same time, however, balance is definitely still needed here.
                          Romance is one of the most human things out there, and the digital dating world is robotic enough

                          U.S, Soccer has announced the hiring of Matt Crocker as the federation’s new sporting director. The
                          48-year-old will replace Earnie Stewart, who left U.S. Soccer in January to take a role with Dutch
                          power PSV. Crocker joins from Southampton, where he is currently serving as the club’s director of
                          football operations. Prior to that, he spent seven years as the head of England’s youth
                          international teams for both men and women. “I’m really honored and excited to join U.S. Soccer as
                          sporting director,” Crocker told reporters on Tuesday. “The immediate focus is supporting where I
                          can the women’s World Cup team as they get ready for Australia and New Zealand… Leading the search
                          for the next men’s coach is an opportunity I’m excited about.” Per U.S. Soccer, Crocker will not
                          start on a full-time basis until August 2 (which is to say, one day after the U.S. women’s national
                          team finishes its group stage slate at the World Cup), but “will immediately begin the process of
                          hiring the head coach of the Men’s National Team and supporting the U.S. Women’s National Team
                          general manager Kate Markgraf and USWNT head coach Vlatko Andonovski.” Crocker’s first, and
                          arguably biggest task in his new job will be hiring a permanent U.S. men’s national team head coach
                          ahead of a home World Cup in 2026.

                          championships for the USA, winning the 1999 Women's World Cup and two Olympic gold medals, as the
                          first General Manager of the Women’s National Team. As the Sporting Director, Stewart will oversee

                          youth National Team programs, to create a more streamlined structure, align the overall technical
                          approach and ensure greater communication and sharing of best practices within Federation programs.
                          Reporting directly to the CEO, Stewart will also oversee all other Sports Performance departments,
                          including Talent Identification, High Performance and Analytics. This framework will lead to
                          enhanced player development, more clearly defined pathways through the National Teams pyramid and
                          help drive the ultimate goal, which is winning championships with the senior teams. At the same
                          time, efforts to increase participation in the sport overall will be aided through his influence on
                          coaching education, referee training and club development. “This is a great day for the Federation
                          and for soccer in America," said U.S. Soccer Federation President Carlos Cordeiro. “In Earnie
                          Stewart and Kate Markgraf, we’re keeping our commitment to ensure that soccer operations are run by

                          U.S, Soccer has announced the hiring of Matt Crocker as the federation’s new sporting director. The
                          48-year-old will replace Earnie Stewart, who left U.S. Soccer in January to take a role with Dutch
                          power PSV. Crocker joins from Southampton, where he is currently serving as the club’s director of
                          football operations. Prior to that, he spent seven years as the head of England’s youth
                          international teams for both men and women. “I’m really honored and excited to join U.S. Soccer as
                          sporting director,” Crocker told reporters on Tuesday. “The immediate focus is supporting where I
                          can the women’s World Cup team as they get ready for Australia and New Zealand… Leading the search
                          for the next men’s coach is an opportunity I’m excited about.” Per U.S. Soccer, Crocker will not
                          start on a full-time basis until August 2 (which is to say, one day after the U.S. women’s national
                          team finishes its group stage slate at the World Cup), but “will immediately begin the process of
                          hiring the head coach of the Men’s National Team and supporting the U.S. Women’s National Team
                          general manager Kate Markgraf and USWNT head coach Vlatko Andonovski.” Crocker’s first, and
                          arguably biggest task in his new job will be hiring a permanent U.S. men’s national team head coach
                          ahead of a home World Cup in 2026.

  - Answer              : Jackie Chan
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          With two unique stories under her belt, Manzoor talked to EW about what inspired her first film and
                          who her biggest influences are as a storyteller. Polite Society is a mix of thrilling action
                          sequences and comedy, so it's no surprise that one of Manzoor's biggest influences is Jackie Chan.
                          "I love watching Jackie Chan movies," shares Manzoor. "As a kid, I thought his mix of comedy and
                          martial arts was something that got me excited about cinema." The director fondly remembers going
                          to see Chan and Chris Tucker in Rush Hour and being blown away by not only how funny it was but
                          that the big-screen comedy starred people of color. The 1998 classic was her gateway to Chan's
                          other work, including Police Story and Drunken Master. Bollywood spectacles have also had a real
                          impact on Manzoor's work. "I grew up on a very heavy diet of Bollywood movies," she says of the
                          weekly trips she took to the cinema with her mother growing up. One of her favorites is the 2002
                          film Devdas, based on Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay's 1917 novel about a law graduate who returns to
                          London to marry his childhood friend. "That film stands out because I was so impressed with the
                          filmmaker," she shares. "I feel like we sometimes look down on Bollywood cinema in the West and I
                          remember being so moved by the craft of that film in particular.

                          left us with some pretty interesting cliffhangers. After 10 hilarious and wine-filled episodes with
                          the gang, Grand Crew Season 2 officially came to an end on April 28 with Episode 9's "Wine &
                          Journals" and Episode 10's "Wine & Tastings." Watch Grand Crew on NBC and Peacock. The majority of
                          the characters were left with some pretty major cliffhangers that could mean big changes in the
                          future — so what exactly happened? Keep reading on for an official recap of the Grand Crew Season 2
                          finale. In "Wine & Journals," we learned that following the directive of his therapist, Noah (Echo
                          Kellum) began keeping a personal journal. And by the finale, he tells Sherm (Carl Tart) that it's
                          begun to turn into a screenplay rather than a typical diary. At the end of the episode, we see that
                          he's printed it out with the title, A Hopeless Romantic...and the Friends That Gave Him Hope. Could
                          Noah be on the road to getting a book deal and becoming a published author? Towards the end of the
                          season Wyatt (Justin Cunningham) and Kristen (Maya Lynn Robinson) took in his young niece-cousin,
                          Nadine, when her mother was going through a hard time.

                          The Chinese city of Chengdu will be the host city for The World Games 2025. On Thursday 9 May, in
                          Gold Coast, Australia, the Mayor of Chengdu, Mr Luo Qiang, signed the Organiser Agreement for the
                          12th edition of the multi-sports event. The Vice President of IOC and the Chinese Olympic
                          Committee, Mr Yu Zaiqing, signed the agreement as Witness. President Jose Perurena signed on behalf
                          of the International World Games Association. This was preceded by ratification of the contract by
                          the 37 member federations of the IWGA during the Annual General Meeting at the SportAccord
                          Convention in Gold Coast. Chengdu follows the city of Birmingham, Alabama as host. The 11th edition

                          competes for the title of Ultimate Firefighter at the World Police and Fire Games. The
                          international competition is set to come to Birmingham in 2025. The Magic City will host the World
                          Police and Fire Games (WPFG), an event featuring more than 10,000 first responders competing in
                          1,600 medal events, from June 27 to July 6, 2025. The city’s successful bid for the event was
                          announced in May by local officials and The World Police and Fire Games Federation. “From the
                          beginning, we were impressed by all that Birmingham has to offer,” said LC Collins, president of
                          the WPFG. “We believe that this city is the whole package – from its venues, infrastructure and
                          history of hosting major events, to its entertainment, dining and attractions." The decision comes
                          following a presentation to the Federation’s Board of Directors by the Birmingham Bid Committee,
                          which was led by the Greater Birmingham Convention and Visitors Bureau, the city of Birmingham and
                          Jefferson County. The games are “expected to have an economic impact of $75 million on the
                          Birmingham region and will showcase our home to over 150,000 people between athletes, supporters
                          and spectators,” said Jefferson County Commissioner Steve Ammons. Events will be hosted at more
                          than 35 venues around the city and will be free and open for all spectators.

Question 287              : When was Pixel Fold announced?
Correct Answers         :  
                          May 10, May 10, May. 10, 10 May, 10 May, 10 May.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prediction (only positive):
  - Answer              : May 10, 2023
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          For charging, the Pixel Fold supports 21W wired speeds. However, you’ll have to purchase Google’s
                          30W power adapter ($25 at Google Store) separately. The phone also supports wireless charging at up
                          to 7.5W and will work with any Qi wireless charger. No. Furthermore, the Google Pixel does not
                          support pen/stylus input. The Pixel Fold’s inner display is protected by Ultra Thin Glass, complete
                          with a protective plastic layer applied. Gorilla Glass Victus protects the external display. Yes.
                          The Google Pixel Fold has an IPX8 certification, which means it can be submerged in up to 1.5
                          meters of freshwater for up to 30 minutes. No, Google no longer includes chargers with its
                          smartphones. You’ll have to buy a compatible charger that supports USB Power Delivery PPS. The
                          Google Pixel Fold supports dual SIMs. One is a nano-SIM slot, and the second is via eSIM. The Pixel
                          Fold was announced on May 10, 2023. General availability of the phone will commence in June 2023.
                          Folding phones are great for those who want a large-screen device but don’t want the size penalty
                          of carrying a tablet. Based on our hands-on experience, the Pixel Fold should also be a great

                          budget-friendly Pixel 7a, Google’s first folding handset is finally here. The highly-anticipated
                          Pixel Fold will compete for your attention in a quickly crowding foldable phones market of which
                          Samsung is currently king. Here’s everything you need to know about the Google Pixel Fold. Google
                          officially unveiled the Pixel Fold at Google I/O on March 10, 2023. It comes in two colors —
                          Obsidian and Porcelain. You can also choose between three official Pixel Fold cases that come in
                          Hazel, Porcelain, and Bay colors (pictured above). Google is charging a similar price to the rival
                          Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4. The 256GB variant of the Pixel Fold will cost you a whopping $1,799. The
                          512GB version is even more expensive at $1,919, which seems costly for Google’s first attempt at a
                          foldable phone. Google hopes you buy the foldable Pixel for its thin form factor, “true pocket
                          size,” loaded camera features, “all-day battery,” multi-tasking skills, and long-lasting software
                          support. However, we’ll only know if it justifies that price when we review the device. As for
                          availability, Google is not casting a very wide net for the Pixel Fold. The handset will only sell
                          in the US, UK, Germany, and Japan, at least to start with.

                          For charging, the Pixel Fold supports 21W wired speeds. However, you’ll have to purchase Google’s
                          30W power adapter ($25 at Google Store) separately. The phone also supports wireless charging at up
                          to 7.5W and will work with any Qi wireless charger. No. Furthermore, the Google Pixel does not
                          support pen/stylus input. The Pixel Fold’s inner display is protected by Ultra Thin Glass, complete
                          with a protective plastic layer applied. Gorilla Glass Victus protects the external display. Yes.
                          The Google Pixel Fold has an IPX8 certification, which means it can be submerged in up to 1.5
                          meters of freshwater for up to 30 minutes. No, Google no longer includes chargers with its
                          smartphones. You’ll have to buy a compatible charger that supports USB Power Delivery PPS. The
                          Google Pixel Fold supports dual SIMs. One is a nano-SIM slot, and the second is via eSIM. The Pixel
                          Fold was announced on May 10, 2023. General availability of the phone will commence in June 2023.
                          Folding phones are great for those who want a large-screen device but don’t want the size penalty
                          of carrying a tablet. Based on our hands-on experience, the Pixel Fold should also be a great
                          traditional handset when folded. There’s no indication that Google is working on a second, smaller
                          flip phone to partner the Pixel Fold or challenge the Galaxy Z Flip series.

                          Apart from its folding design, Google’s pricey new phone also mostly sticks to familiar territory —
                          we haven’t seen much so far that sets it apart from other Pixels and other foldables. Google may
                          well develop more standout tricks for the Fold down the road — we know the company is working on an
                          “interpreter mode” for Google Translate that uses both screens for in-person translations — but it
                          feels like a lot of the same in a new package for now. What it is: a new, midrange smartphone How
                          much does it cost? $499 What does it promise? Google’s most thoughtful software features, on a
                          budget. With the Pixel 7a, Google mostly stuck to its usual playbook: it took last year’s Pixel 7,
                          kept most of its important guts, made its shell out of cheaper materials, and planned to sell it
                          for less. This time, Google made one surprising change to the formula: it stuck a higher-resolution
                          main camera sensor in the back, so expect slightly more detailed photos. Apart from that, though,
                          this is Google’s attempt at making some of its hallmark Pixel features, like Magic Eraser for
                          photos, smart call screening, and a tool for quickly navigating customer service phone trees
                          available to a wider audience. That may all sound a bit basic, and perhaps it is. But after living
                          with the device for about a week, I never really felt like I was missing out on anything more
                          expensive devices offered.

                          Medi-Cal, even if their income or other circumstances changed. This became known as the “continuous
                          coverage requirement.” This assured that low-income families, older adults, working adults,
                          children, and people with disabilities would have access to health care throughout the pandemic.

                          2023, enrollees can continue to access COVID-19 tests, vaccines and treatment with no prior
                          authorization or cost sharing when they access these services through their health plan’s network.
                          Health plan enrollees can be charged cost-sharing only if these services are provided out of

                          federal government required states to continue to cover every person who became eligible for
                          Medi-Cal, even if their income or other circumstances changed. This became known as the “continuous
                          coverage requirement.” This assured that low-income families, older adults, working adults,
                          children, and people with disabilities would have access to health care throughout the pandemic.

                          A small image of Clippit can be found in Office 2013 and newer, which can be seen by going to
                          Options and changing the theme (or Office Background) to "School Supplies". Clippit would then
                          appear on the ribbon. In July 2021, Microsoft used Twitter to show off a redesign of Clippit, and
                          said that if it received 20,000 likes they would replace the paperclip emoji on Microsoft 365 with
                          the character.[15] The Tweet quickly surpassed 20,000 likes and they then announced they would
                          replace it.[16][17] In November 2021, Microsoft officially updated their design of the paperclip
                          emoji (📎) on Windows 11 to be Clippit.[6] The default assistant in the English version was named
                          Clippy.[7][8] The character was designed by Kevan J. Atteberry.[8][18] Clippit was by far the most
                          notable Assistant (partly because in many cases the setup CD was required to install the other
                          assistants), which also led to it being called simply the Microsoft Paperclip.[5] The original
                          Clippit from Office 97 was given a new look in Office 2000. Apart from Clippit, other Office
                          Assistants were also available: In many cases the Office installation CD was necessary to activate
                          a different Office assistant character, so the default character, Clippit, remains widely known
                          compared to other Office Assistants.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          By Jay Peters, a news editor who writes about technology, video games, and virtual worlds. He’s
                          submitted several accepted emoji proposals to the Unicode Consortium. Google’s latest Photos trick
                          is a feature it’s calling Magic Editor, which uses generative AI to let you make major edits to a
                          photo without professional tools. The company revealed the feature at Google I/O 2023. Google
                          shared a couple examples of Magic Editor in action that are both pretty cool. In one, a photo of a
                          person in front of a waterfall, Google entirely moves the person further to the side of the photo,
                          erases people in the background, and makes the sky a prettier blue. Watch this GIF to see it all
                          happen: In another photo, Magic Editor scoots a child on a bench closer to the middle of the photo,
                          which generates “new” parts of the bench and balloons to the left to fill in the space. In this
                          example, Google again makes the sky more vibrant. Check it out in this GIF: It’s impressive stuff —
                          and a logical next step from photo features like Photo Unblur and Magic Eraser. It’s also not quite
                          perfect given leftover artifacts like creases from the bag strap in the waterfall photo and a
                          misplaced shadow under the bench in the second.

                          In February, OpenAI launched a premium subscription for the app, ChatGPT Plus, which offers
                          priority access and responses generated using the company’s latest language model, GPT-4. It costs
                          $20 a month. To date, the best way to access OpenAI’s language models on mobile has been to use
                          Microsoft’s Bing app, which offers access to the company’s GPT-4-powered chatbot. An official app
                          from ChatGPT will likely attract some of these users away from Microsoft, which has been using
                          access to its chatbot as a way to lure people toward Bing and Edge. The launch of an official
                          ChatGPT should also, hopefully, stop people from signing up for the countless spam and fake apps
                          that purport to offer access to the chatbot on mobile. Of course, ChatGPT has the same issues on
                          mobile as it does on the web. These include the bot’s tendency to fabricate information with
                          complete confidence, and privacy fears. OpenAI only recently gave users the option to make
                          conversations private, and the app’s homescreen (as seen above) still warns users not to share
                          “sensitive info” on the app. / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent

                          You'll now have easy access to ChatGPT from your iPhone. OpenAI announced Thursday it was launching
                          a ChatGPT app. Basically, the app promises to put the generative AI chatbot in your pocket. "We're
                          starting our rollout in the US and will expand to additional countries in the coming weeks," OpenAI
                          said in a statement. "We're eager to see how you use the app. As we gather user feedback, we're
                          committed to continuous feature and safety improvements for ChatGPT." The app was available for
                          download on the App Store shortly after the announcement. The app is free to use and will sync your
                          history with ChatGPT across devices. It also uses OpenAI's speech-recognition system Whisper to
                          integrate voice input. Those subscribed to ChatGPT Plus will get all the exclusive Chat GPT-4
                          capabilities on iOS as well. The app will certainly make using ChatGPT easier for most folks, since
                          we're constantly on our phones. OpenAI wrote in their statement that it had "heard from users that
                          they love using ChatGPT on the go" from Day 1. Those folks have gotten their wish. More in

  - Source              :
                          The draft is conducted under the eligibility rules established in the league's 2017 collective
                          bargaining agreement (CBA) with its players' union, with special modifications agreed to by both
                          parties due to disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The previous CBA that ended the 2011
                          lockout instituted no immediate changes to the draft, but it called for a committee of owners and
                          players to discuss further charges. Players who were not automatically eligible had to declare
                          their eligibility for the draft by notifying the NBA offices in writing no later than at least 60
                          days before the event. For the 2023 draft, the date fell on April 23. Under the CBA a player may
                          withdraw his name from consideration from the draft at any time before the final declaration
                          deadline, which usually falls 10 days before the draft at 5:00 pm EDT (2100 UTC). Under current

Question 296              : What is the name of Apple's headset?

                          But once you turn it on, there are some distinct differences. The biggest one is that the front of
                          the visor features a display underneath a curved pane of 3D laminated glass. This allows the Vision
                          Pro to use EyeSight, a feature that shows others around you your eyes so they feel like they're
                          interacting with you like they would normally. This glass pane also serves as a lens for the Vision
                          Pro's camera array, which is extensive. The Vision Pro includes 12 cameras and six microphones so
                          that users do not need controllers to control the device. Instead, you will use a combination of
                          eye tracking, hand gestures and voice commands. But the front display isn't all that is crafted
                          using Apple's typical eye for details. The mixed reality headset features a custom aluminum alloy
                          frame that is curved to fit your face. Apple takes this focus on custom fit further by using a
                          modular design so the Light Seal (what Meta calls a facial interface) fits to your face as
                          perfectly as possible. The Light Seal comes in several shapes and sizes and is made of a soft
                          fabric for improved comfort while using the Vision Pro. Apple also continues its focus on fit with
                          the Head Band, which is also available in a variety of sizes. It is made of a 3D knitted fabric and
                          attaches via a simple locking mechanism at the front of the headband. It's around here that you'll
                          also find the speakers, which Apple dubs "audio pods.

                          Angeles Country Club will host a major for the first time ever when the 2023 U.S. Open begins on
                          Thursday. World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler will try to continue his run of dominant play in big
                          events, and enters as the 13-2 betting favorite in the latest 2023 U.S. Open odds from Caesars
                          Sportsbook. He is followed on the PGA odds board by Jon Rahm (8-1), Brooks Koepka (17-2), Viktor
                          Hovland (10-1), and Rory McIlroy (11-1). The 2023 U.S. Open field is playing for a total purse of
                          $17.5 million that features a winner's share of $3.15 million. Defending U.S. Open champion Matt
                          Fitzpatrick is a 35-1 longshot. Should you target the 28-year-old Englishman when making your 2023
                          U.S. Open one and done picks? Would it make more sense to use a favorite like Scheffler, Rahm, or
                          Koepka in your PGA one and done picks? Before locking in your 2023 U.S. Open one and done picks,

                          He then finished his round by making a 22-foot putt for birdie on the 18th to get to seven-under
                          for the tournament and end up alone in fourth place.[22] Sunday, June 18, 2023 Wyndham Clark shot
                          an even-par 70 to win his first career U.S. Open and major championship.[23] Beginning the round
                          tied with Rickie Fowler for the lead, he hit his approach shot on the par-3 fourth hole to five
                          feet for a birdie to get to 11-under and take sole possession of the lead. He also birdied the
                          par-4 sixth hole from the rough just short of the green, but at the eighth hole hit his second shot
                          into the rough to the left of the green. He failed to advance the ball on his third shot and ended
                          up with a bogey on the par-five.[24] With a two-shot lead playing the par-5 14th hole, Clark found
                          the green in two shots and two-putted from 20 feet for a birdie to get to 12-under and open up a
                          three-shot lead with four holes to play. He hit his tee shot on the par-3 15th over the green and
                          failed to get up and down, settling for a bogey, then drove into a bunker on the 16th and had to
                          chip back into the fairway.

                          Prime Day itself will launch very early in the morning on July 11 and offer waves of deals, some
                          with limited inventory, throughout the day, in addition to all-day discounts. Amazon’s summer Prime
                          Day sale hasn’t even begun, but speculation of a similar sale is already underway. The retailer
                          first introduced the concept of a major sale on October 13 and 14, 2020, after its summer Prime Day
                          sale was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic. But after returning to business as usual with the launch
                          of Prime Day 2021 in June—the earliest kick-off to date—Amazon followed up its July 2022 Prime Day
                          sale with its inaugural Prime Early Access Sale, on October 11 and 12, 2022. It remains to be seen
                          whether Amazon plans to follow suit this fall with a 2023 Prime Early Access Sale, but it’s very
                          possible that the retailer could seize the opportunity to get ahead of its competitors before Black
                          Friday 2023 sales begin in November. Amazon promises Prime-exclusive deals on
                          Wirecutter-recommended brands like Sony, Bose, and Theragun. The company is also introducing an
                          invite-only deals program for products it has deemed likely to sell out—Prime members can sign up
                          for access in advance of the event.

                          Some early Prime Day price drops are already on the table, with Amazon offering discounts on its
                          own products, including Wirecutter-recommended devices like the Kindle Paperwhite Kids ebook reader
                          and the Echo Dot Kids (5th Gen) Alexa smart speaker. From now through midnight Pacific Time on July
                          7, 2023, Prime members can also receive a $15 Amazon credit if they download the Amazon Photos app
                          and upload their first photo. Originating in 2015 as a celebration of Amazon’s 20th birthday, Prime
                          Day is an Amazon Prime–exclusive sales event. Prime members get access to some of the better prices
                          available on a variety of stuff, from Amazon’s own selection of smart speakers to housewares, baby
                          gear, laptops, and clothing. There are several ways savvy shoppers can prepare for Prime Day. As in
                          years past, Prime members can once again set up deals alerts based on previous Amazon searches and
                          recently viewed items. Visit the Prime Day event page on the Amazon app between now and Prime Day
                          to create a deals alert, and you’ll receive push notifications when deals become available. Amazon
                          has also rolled out a new, invite-only deals program this year, through which Prime members can
                          request an invitation to score some (so-called) exclusive deals on items that are expected to sell
                          out. We’re waiting to see what these deals entail, but we anticipate seeing discounts on everything
                          from robot vacuums and smart TVs to exercise equipment and small appliances.

  - Source              :
                          "It hasn't even sunk in," Mahomes said after completing 21 of 27 passes for 182 yards and three
                          touchdowns and winning Super Bowl MVP honors for the second time. "I appreciate it because of the
                          failure of losing the Super Bowl (in the 2020 campaign) and the AFC Championship Game (last
                          season). It gives you greater appreciation for being a champion." Mahomes acknowledged that there
                          was a huge difference between his reaction to winning this title and his first championship, a
                          victory over San Francisco in Super Bowl LIV. Mahomes compared that first accomplishment to a
                          wide-eyed kid taking home a prize from the fair. There was a whirlwind of success, accompanied by
                          an offseason of celebrating and an attempt at a repeat that ended with that blowout loss to Tampa
                          Bay in Super Bowl LV. Then came an overtime loss to Cincinnati in last year's AFC Championship
                          Game, a defeat that had plenty to do with Mahomes playing his worst half of football in a
                          second-half meltdown against the Bengals. Mahomes grew from all those moments in ways that weren't
                          that visible when this regular season began. There was so much attention paid to the trade that
                          sent Hill to Miami and all the blockbuster personnel moves made by the rest of the AFC West that it
                          seemed as if the Chiefs were more vulnerable than ever. That was the first mistake made by all the
                          doubters. They couldn't see that Mahomes is usually at his best when others are predicting his
                          downfall.
