                          May 29, 2023 Few things feel like summer, quite like taking a vacation or going to the movies.
                          There’s something about the open road that just feels healing, and there’s something about a silver
                          screen and popcorn that just feels right. Now, every so often, something magical happens, and we’re
                          treated to a perfect combination of summer pastimes, culminating in a genre that stands alone:
                          road-trip films. Stories about cooped-up families, reluctant companions, or cavalcades of muppets
                          seem to resonate with all of us, validating the joys and stresses of our own cross-country
                          adventures – almost as if we’re watching a movie about ourselves. So, to celebrate the start of the
                          summer season and to help spark some inspiration of what to do (or not do) on your next trip, we’ve
                          put together our list of the all-time best road-trip movies. Alright, so technically, this isn’t a
                          summer road-trip movie, considering it’s one of the few films set during Thanksgiving, but it’s
                          still the all-time best buddy adventure film. Steve Martin and John Candy were a match made in
                          Heaven, and the jokes still land over 30 years later. Little Miss Sunshine is a heartwarming indie
                          comedy about a quirky family of misfits trying to get their daughter to a beauty pageant. It has an
                          incredible soundtrack featuring Sufjan Stevens and stellar performances, including a burgeoning
                          Steve Carell.

                          He threw for 224 yards and ran for 73 more, including a gutsy 11-yard scramble that set up the
                          game-winning field goal. UCLA took a 35-34 lead with 34 seconds remaining, but Patti quickly led
                          the Panthers into field goal range, allowing Ben Sauls to boot his fourth field goal of the game.
                          This one, a 47-yarder, was the game-winner. Pitt coach Pat Narduzzi has already indicated that
                          Patti won't be back next season. So if that was Patti's final college game, he went out with a
                          bang. Fresno State: After a 1-4 start, Fresno State closed out the season with nine consecutive
                          wins. After beating Boise State in the Mountain West title game, the Bulldogs cruised past
                          Washington State 29-6 in the LA Bowl to get to 10 wins for the fourth time in the last six seasons.
                          In the process, Fresno State became the first team in FBS history to get to 10 wins after losing
                          four of five to start the season. The LA Bowl was the final college game for Jake Haener and he
                          went out in style. Haener threw for 280 yards and two touchdowns while Jordan Mims rushed out for
                          209 yards and had two scores of his own. Duke: Duke went from winless in ACC play in 2021 to nine
                          wins in 2022.

Question 4              : What position did Jason Semore hold at Valdosta State before returning to Georgia Tech?
Correct Answers         :  
                          defensive coordinator
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - Source              :
                          “And he really understood everything about the defense and how it worked. And I was like, ‘Man,
                          this guy’s a young guy, but he’s ready to do this.’” When Stitt was hired as head coach at FCS
                          Montana in December 2014, he hired Semore first as safeties coach and special-teams coordinator and
                          then moved him up to defensive coordinator. “He really relates well to the players, and he just has
                          a way of getting the most out of them,” Stitt said. “They really, really play hard for him.” It
                          also was at Oklahoma State where Gundy gave him his nickname, Boogie. It had nothing to do with
                          Semore; it was the nickname of an assistant who had just left the team. “It was probably because he
                          didn’t remember my name,” Semore said. “It was right when I got hired, and then everybody started
                          calling me that.” His job at Oklahoma State also connected him with Andrew Thacker, then a GA.
                          Thacker helped bring him to Temple in 2018 as a defensive analyst, and Collins brought him to Tech
                          for a similar position that he held before taking a defensive coordinator job at Division II
                          Valdosta State. But back to the nickname. Said Malone, the Kansas State assistant coach who brought
                          him to Oklahoma State from Tulsa, “I do remember Jason always being like, ‘Damn, he doesn’t know my
                          name’ when he first got there.

                          NCAAF 45 Brent Key was pulled out of an offensive game plan meeting on Oct. 4 and told to walk up
                          the hill to Georgia Tech’s administrative offices. When Key, the offensive line coach, got there,
                          he learned head coach Geoff Collins had been fired. Key, a Georgia Tech graduate who started at
                          guard all four years on The Flats, would be the head coach for the remainder of the season.
                          Advertisement As he walked back down the hill toward the football offices, Key, 42, immediately

                          nearly a year earlier — he had to fix one glaring issue. So he headed straight for the office of
                          linebackers coach Jason Semore. Semore, known to his friends as Boogie, instantly knew what Key
                          wanted to discuss. Something had to be done about Georgia Tech’s punt protection. The Yellow
                          Jackets had four punts blocked in their first four games. A block two days earlier at UCF had been
                          returned for a touchdown and erased a Georgia Tech lead just before halftime. Clemson had blocked
                          two punts in the season opener. Ole Miss had blocked one near the start of a 42-0 blowout. Of all
                          the things Georgia Tech had done wrong over the course of a 1-3 start, punt protection was the most
                          consistently bad.

                          Advertisement Supported by The electric-car maker managed substantial growth as Europe and China
                          increasingly propelled sales. By Neal E. Boudette Tesla reported Sunday that it delivered 936,000
                          cars in 2021, an 87 percent increase from the year before, despite the computer chip shortage that
                          has disrupted auto production around the world. In the fourth quarter alone, the company delivered
                          more than 308,000 vehicles, a 71 percent increase from the quarter a year earlier. The overwhelming
                          share of the deliveries were of the Model 3 sedan and the Model Y hatchback. Wall Street analysts
                          had been expecting deliveries of about 266,000 cars in the fourth quarter, and about 855,000 for
                          the year. “The numbers are hard to poke holes in,” Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities,
                          wrote in a note to investors. “While there are many competitors in the E.V. space, Tesla continues
                          to dominate market share as evidenced again this quarter.” Tesla increased sales despite a global
                          shortage of computer chips, which serve as the brains for a variety of electronics, including
                          engine controllers and touch screens. The shortage forced most automakers to idle some plants for
                          weeks at a time and kept them from producing as many vehicles as they had planned. In July, Tesla’s
                          chief executive, Elon Musk, said his company was overcoming the shortage by switching to types of
                          chips that were more readily available and writing new instructions, or firmware, to be embedded
                          into the chip.

                          Microchip shortage? What microchip shortage? EV maker Tesla, which it should be pointed out
                          produces its own chips in-house, seems not to have been bothered by supply-chain issues all that
                          much in 2021, delivering 936,172 vehicles in the year just ended, according to a report by finance
                          news outlet Finbold. That represents a healthy 87 percent increase over 2020, when the company
                          handed over 499,550 Teslas to customers. Even better for the company, it ended the year with a
                          bang, racking up a record number of sales in the last quarter of 2021, or 308,600 units. Most of
                          that total consisted of Model 3 and Model Y models, no surprise. It’s the sixth consecutive quarter
                          that it breaks its record for sales. In 2019, the automaker delivered 367,500 units, so annual
                          sales growth, while not exponential, is clearly accelerating. The company has said in the past that
                          one its main goals is to attain 50 percent sales growth year after year. Once upon a time, Tesla
                          struggled mightily to hit its delivery targets, but no more. There’s also no sign of that growth
                          slowing down any time soon, even as all-electric rivals join the market by the month. Projections
                          made by Finbold put estimated sales for 2022 at over 1.5 million units, for an increase of close to
                          65 percent. Shopicar.

                          Super Bowl LVI[12] was an American football game played to determine the champion of the National

                          Angeles Rams defeated the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Cincinnati Bengals, 23–20.
                          The game was played on February 13, 2022, at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, the home

                          playing and winning in its home stadium.[13][14][15][16] The Rams' victory was their second, first

                          in St. Louis. Finishing with a 12–5 record, the Rams reached their fifth appearance after acquiring
                          veteran quarterback Matthew Stafford, who had not won a playoff game in his previous 12 years with
                          the Detroit Lions. The Bengals, who finished with a 10–7 record, were seeking their first Super
                          Bowl title following several decades of losing seasons and playoff struggles. They won their first
                          playoff game since 1990, ending the longest drought in the four major North American sports, en
                          route to their third Super Bowl appearance and first since 1988's Super Bowl XXIII.

                          stadium in the same city; for example, Los Angeles's last five Super Bowls were all played at the
                          Rose Bowl, which has never been used by any NFL franchise outside of the Super Bowl.

                          On February 21, 2022, Truth Social was released on Apple iOS,[98] reaching number one on the App
                          Store's top charts.[99][100] Due to an extensive backlog of applicants, upon downloading the app,
                          about 500,000 people who initially attempted to register as users were automatically
                          waitlisted.[101][102][103] The app was installed 872,000 times during its first week, but a month
                          later, new user signup had fallen to 60,000 per week. During that time, weekly visits to
                          truthsocial.com fell from 6 million to fewer than 2 million.[104] Upon its launch, the British
                          automotive solar power company Trailar complained Truth Social's app logo closely resembled its "T"
                          logo.[105] The platform has been criticized for its poor performance at launch, with waitlisting
                          users attempting to register and extended outages.[106] A day after its launch, The Washington Post
                          described it as "a disaster".[101] A week after, Newsweek reported some early adopters were
                          beginning to lose interest in the app due to low numbers of users and poor engagement, although
                          others were willing to persevere with the app to see if things would improve.[107] The Truth Social
                          platform suffered from severe and persistent problems with scalability at launch, limiting the
                          platform's growth.[108][109]

                          to be in the first place. Following the wide banning of Donald Trump across multiple social media
                          network sites in 2021, an alternative service that didn’t censor its users was advertised as in the
                          works. In February of 2022, that alternative service manifested in the launch of Truth Social on
                          iPhone. At the time, Android support was understood to be coming, but there's was no clear
                          indication of when. Related: Trump's Truth Social Posts On Other Platforms Delay, Explained In
                          terms of Android support, not a lot has actually changed since then, and it remains unknown when
                          Truth Social will be available to download from the Google Play Store. Comments last month from the
                          Truth Social CEO confirmed the app was still en route, explaining that it was waiting on approval
                          from Google before it can be made available via the Play Store. How long that approval process
                          takes typically depends on the app.

                          On February 21, 2022, Truth Social was released on Apple iOS,[98] reaching number one on the App
                          Store's top charts.[99][100] Due to an extensive backlog of applicants, upon downloading the app,
                          about 500,000 people who initially attempted to register as users were automatically
                          waitlisted.[101][102][103] The app was installed 872,000 times during its first week, but a month
                          later, new user signup had fallen to 60,000 per week. During that time, weekly visits to
                          truthsocial.com fell from 6 million to fewer than 2 million.[104] Upon its launch, the British
                          automotive solar power company Trailar complained Truth Social's app logo closely resembled its "T"
                          logo.[105] The platform has been criticized for its poor performance at launch, with waitlisting
                          users attempting to register and extended outages.[106] A day after its launch, The Washington Post
                          described it as "a disaster".[101] A week after, Newsweek reported some early adopters were
                          beginning to lose interest in the app due to low numbers of users and poor engagement, although
                          others were willing to persevere with the app to see if things would improve.[107] The Truth Social
                          platform suffered from severe and persistent problems with scalability at launch, limiting the
                          platform's growth.[108][109]

                          Best Picture Drama: “The Power of the Dog” Jane Campion’s first film in more than a decade, “The
                          Power of the Dog,” took home the most prestigious award of the night. “Power of the Dog” won Best
                          Picture Drama, Best Director Motion Picture (Jane Campion), and Best Supporting Actor — Motion
                          Picture (Kodi Smit-McPhee). The acclaimed Netflix drama was the most-nominated movie along with
                          “Belfast,” with each film earning seven nominations. Campion became the third woman to win in this
                          category at Golden Globes. Best Television Series — Musical or Comedy: “Hacks” HBO Max’s “Hacks”

                          Jean Smart at the 79th Golden Globes Awards. While other shows in this category were also strong
                          contenders, such as Apple TV+’s “Ted Lasso,” “Hacks” proved to be a favorite in this category with
                          its first season. “Hacks can laugh all the way to the bank with this one,” announced the official
                          Golden Globes account via Twitter. “Congratulations on taking home the #GoldenGlobe for Best
                          Musical/Comedy Series.” Best Television Series — Drama: “Succession” HBO’s “Succession” was the big
                          winner at this year’s Golden Globes, scooping three major categories.

                          On the TV side, ABC comedy Abbott Elementary — which boasted the most nominations of any show with
                          five — built off of its Emmy momentum and went to the head of the class, winning best comedy honors
                          and Golden Globes for Quinta Brunson and Tyler James Williams. An even bigger Emmy magnet, HBO's
                          The White Lotus, enjoyed the privilege of converting its four nominations into two awards, one for
                          best limited series and another for Jennifer Coolidge (who also delivered the funniest speech of
                          the night). And then Game of Thrones prequel House of the Dragon added some surprise to the night
                          by claiming the best drama award. Elsewhere, Tár's Cate Blanchett, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever's
                          Angela Bassett, and Elvis' Austin Butler scored trophies, along with The Bear's Jeremy Allen White,

                          In Hollywood, the maxim goes, “The show must go on.” Even, it seems, if there is no show. So it was
                          that, on Sunday evening, the embattled Hollywood Foreign Press Assn. — bumped off the air by NBC
                          following months of blistering controversy sparked by a February 2021 Times investigation — handed
                          out its 79th Golden Globe Awards at a glitz-free private event in the ballroom of the Beverly
                          Hilton hotel, with no celebrities, no host and no free-flowing champagne. As in any year, the night
                          had its big winners. Jane Campion’s brooding western “Power of the Dog” won the best picture prize
                          in the drama category, and Steven Spielberg’s sweeping new take on “West Side Story” claimed the
                          top prize in the musical or comedy category. The HBO series “Succession” and “Hacks” won the top
                          series prizes, while actors including Will Smith, Nicole Kidman, Michael Keaton and Kate Winslet
                          claimed trophies too. But none of the nominees chose to attend the event. No stars were there to
                          deliver snappy comic banter or give tearful acceptances speeches. And no one was watching. Company
                          Town Dropped by NBC, shunned by Hollywood and hampered by COVID-19, this year’s Golden Globes
                          ceremony was a small, private and somber affair.

                          festivities.[31] The uniforms for medal presenters at medal ceremonies were unveiled in January
                          2022.[32] The uniforms have been designed in a joint project by the Central Academy of Fine Arts
                          and Beijing Institute of Fashion Technology.[32] The torch relay started on 18 October 2021 in
                          Greece. On 20 October 2021, it was announced that the local leg would start on 2 February and end
                          on 4 February 2022 during the Opening Ceremonies. The local leg only visited two cities: Beijing
                          and Zhangjiakou.[33] Activists staged a protest at the Olympic torch lighting ceremony in
                          Greece.[34]

Question 13              : How much is Microsoft acquiring Activision Blizzard for?
Correct Answers         :

                          what’s new Microsoft is attempting to persuade regulators around the world to clear its $68.7
                          billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard — the biggest deal of its kind the gaming industry has
                          ever seen. Amid concerns about its effect on competition in the industry — particularly in the
                          nascent cloud gaming market — and in the face of ardent lobbying against the deal by competitor
                          Sony, the U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority first decided to block the acquisition, then
                          agreed to further talks with Microsoft and Activision. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has
                          withdrawn its attempt block the deal legally after a federal judge ruled in favor of Microsoft
                          being allowed to close the deal. The European Union, meanwhile, has given the deal its seal of
                          approval. Here’s the latest on Microsoft’s plans to snap up Activision Blizzard. According to
                          Reuters and Bloomberg, the Federal Trade Commission has withdrawn its administrative case against
                          Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard, which was due to go before an in-house judge in
                          August. Microsoft and Activision had requested the case be withdrawn after the FTC lost its case
                          arguing for a block on the deal in district court, and was denied an extension of a temporary block
                          by an appeals court. The move means Microsoft and Activision can now try to persuade the U.S.
                          antitrust regulator to accept a settlement.

                          A federal judge has handed Microsoft a major victory by declining to block its looming $69 billion
                          takeover of video game company Activision Blizzard. Regulators are seeking to ax the deal because
                          they say it will hurt competition. U.S. District Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley said in a ruling
                          that the “FTC has not shown a likelihood it will prevail on its claim this particular vertical
                          merger in this specific industry may substantially lessen competition. To the contrary, the record
                          evidence points to more consumer access to Call of Duty and other Activision content.” Microsoft
                          appeared to have the upper hand in a 5-day San Francisco court hearing that ended late last month.
                          The proceeding showcased testimony by Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella and longtime
                          Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick, who both pledged to keep Activision’s blockbuster game Call
                          of Duty available to people who play it on consoles — particularly Sony’s PlayStation — that
                          compete with Microsoft’s Xbox. Read More: Why Microsoft’s Satya Nadella Doesn’t Think Now Is the

                          said Activision CEO Bobby Kotick in a written statement. Shares of Activision Blizzard Inc. jumped
                          5% on the ruling.

Question 14              : What is the price for a 30-second spot during the Super Bowl 2022?
Correct Answers         :

                          A star-studded lineup of Super Bowl LVII commercials is set to hit our screens on Sunday. While
                          millions of people will be tuning into the intense NFL action between the Kansas City Chiefs and
                          Philadelphia Eagles, a large sum will be even more excited for the iconic commercials. The cost for
                          a 30-second commercial during this year’s Super Bowl is reaching a record-high amount, with
                          advertisers hoping their ad makes a bang for the viewers. Ahead of the game, let’s take a look at
                          the costs of a Super Bowl commercial in 2023 and more history about the big game day ads: In 2023,
                          a 30-second Super Bowl commercial costs a record-high average of $7 million, according to Forbes.
                          In 2022, a 30-second commercial slot during the Super Bowl was $6.5 million, which was an increase
                          from the $5.5 million asked for in 2021. Here were the prices in some recent previous years:

                          There's a reason commercials during the Super Bowl have to refer to the event as the "Big Game"
                          rather than "Super Bowl LVII." The reason is that the term has been a registered NFL trademark
                          since 1969, requiring commercials, radio hosts and other specific media personnel to pay to use the
                          official name.

Question 16              : Who are the recipients of the 2022 Ivan Allen Jr. Prize for Social Courage?
Correct Answers         :  
                          Lawrence Williams, Ralph Long Jr., Ford Greene, Ronald Yancey

                          In 1961, three Black students began classes at Georgia Tech and made history, making the Institute
                          the first higher education entity to peacefully integrate in the Deep South without a court order.
                          Civil unrest was rampant throughout college campuses across the South. In recognition of their
                          roles as trailblazers, Tech’s first Black students — Lawrence Williams, Ralph Long Jr., and the
                          late Ford Greene, along with the first Black graduate Ronald Yancey — were awarded the 2022 Ivan
                          Allen Jr. Prize for Social Courage on April 20 at the Biltmore Ballroom in Atlanta. A symposium was
                          led by 2020 Ivan Allen Jr. Prize recipient Charlayne Hunter-Gault where Long Jr., Williams, and
                          Yancey discussed the integration of the Institute, the former students’ personal experiences, and
                          the continued struggle for racial equity and inclusion at higher education institutes across the
                          nation. During the panel session, the three former students recounted the racism they encountered —
                          despite a facade of peaceful integration. Although their experiences left them feeling socially and
                          intellectually isolated from most of the student body at the time, the pioneers expressed their
                          hope that future generations of Black students at Tech feel at home on campus. “I’m so thankful for
                          those who continue to matriculate here and carry on the tradition,” said Williams. A video greeting
                          from Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens, a Georgia Tech chemical engineering graduate himself, was
                          presented at the celebration.

                          CNN’s chief international anchor Christiane Amanpour is a fearless and uncompromising interviewer
                          who has put her life in danger to give a voice to victims of war. She has been outspoken in calling
                          out human rights abuses and is renowned for holding powerful leaders accountable. For these reasons
                          Amanpour is the recipient of the 2023 Ivan Allen Jr. Prize for Social Courage. Before attending a
                          luncheon to accept the award, Amanpour participated in candid conversations during a Q&A with
                          Georgia Tech students and a fireside chat with the campus community moderated by CNN correspondent
                          Tom Foreman. “We’re on a university campus,” Amanpour said during the chat, “and around campuses
                          across the United States there has been a tendency toward less openness and more canceled culture.
                          People are shying away or not wanting to hear things that they don’t agree with. I think that’s a
                          shame. And I think that’s a problem in terms of where else you’re going to get this opportunity.
                          When else in your life are you going to get the opportunity to hear a whole range of things that
                          you may or may not agree with?” Foreman asked Amanpour for her thoughts on the widespread belief
                          that American viewers are not interested in certain international news stories because “that’s not
                          our fight.” Amanpour disagreed.

                          Metaverse and upcoming tech from Microsoft and Apple. Previously, the tech giant was in the plan to

                          and Google may use a similar type of outer camera technology. The outward cameras on the headsets

                          Google’s augmented reality eyewear is coming to disrupt your face and your business model. If you
                          don’t even have to pull your phone out to take a photo, get directions, or message with friends,
                          why would you need to buy the latest iPhone or spend so much time on Facebook? It could be a year
                          before Google eyewear reaches stores, but that’s why these and other tech companies need to
                          strategize now. If they wait to see if the device is a hit, the world could be seeing through
                          Google-tinted glasses by the time they adapt. Apple and Facebook’s bet might be to team up… If you
                          haven’t heard, Google today announced it is beginning public tests of augmented reality glasses
                          with the codename Project Glass. A mouthwatering mock-up video of what the device might eventually
                          be capable of shows someone using voice commands to send messages, take photos, share to Google+,
                          see the locations of friends, view maps, get directions, set calendar reminders, and more. Cramming
                          all the functionality into a sleek set of glasses is going to take time and effort, but the
                          Google(x) skunklabs is on it. There’s a dozen ways the product could flop, most obviously if the
                          glasses are awkward and unstylish, but also if they’re too heavy, expensive, fragile, or the world
                          is just not quite ready. Let’s forget those for a second.

                          YouTube channel. Big news, folks. The SAT is going digital! The College Board announced that its
                          signature exam would soon be fully digital. Beginning in spring 2024 across America, and spring
                          2023 for international students, SAT takers will take the test on a computer. The College Board
                          promises the test will still measure the same things, be scored on a 1600 scale, and be taken at
                          testing centers or in schools. However, the new digital test will be adaptive, streamlined to two
                          hours from the current three, and students can take it on a laptop or tablet, including their own
                          devices. So, what does all that mean? For current seniors, juniors, or sophomores (in the U.S.),
                          not much. The new SAT won’t be available until spring 2024, making the high school class of 2025
                          the first group to take the digital version.

                          Their buckles easily snapped together and wouldn’t link onto anything they shouldn’t. Then, in
                          2003, Carolyn Bertozzi proposed that click chemistry could be used in studies of biological systems
                          to make it easier to observe vital cellular processes without interfering with them. Bertozzi
                          called this “bioorthogonal” chemistry in a paper she and her colleagues published that year. The
                          term has since been widely-adopted term in the field. The ability to perform complex reactions in
                          living systems without interfering with natural biological reactions made it possible to study
                          molecules and cellular processes in cells and inside complex organisms such as zebra fish, rather
                          than in laboratory dishes. It has already helped scientists understand an important protein
                          processing reaction called glycosylation, helped to develop molecular imaging molecules that could
                          detect disease in living organisms, and opened up the possibility of selectively delivering drugs
                          to particular tissues in the body. These findings have “led to a revolution in how chemists think
                          about linking molecules together and how to do it in living cells,” Åqvist said. Today’s
                          announcement marks the second time that Sharpless has won a Nobel Prize in Chemistry. In 2001, he
                          shared the prize with William Knowles and Ryoji Noyori for the development of catalytic asymmetric
                          synthesis. Sharpless spent much of the 1990s considering the need to find less cumbersome ways to
                          synthesize complex molecules.

                          24] However, the NFL later confirmed on January 13 that the game would remain at SoFi Stadium.[25]
                          Attendance at the game was not limited, unlike Super Bowl LV in 2021, which was played with an
                          audience at 37% of the capacity.[26][27] Fans who went to the Super Bowl festivities prior to the
                          game and those who attended the Super Bowl received a free KN95 mask.[28] Per Los Angeles County
                          public health orders, those attending the game were required to show proof of vaccination, a
                          negative PCR test that was taken within 48 hours, or a negative antigen test that was taken within
                          24 hours.[26][29] The proof of vaccination requirement had been implemented for large outdoor
                          events in Los Angeles County since October 2021.[30] Those requesting media accreditation for the
                          Super Bowl and playoffs were required to be fully vaccinated and have received at least one booster
                          dose of vaccine.[31] The Los Angeles Rams finished the 2021 season with a 12–5 record under
                          fifth-year head coach Sean McVay.[32] This was their fifth Super Bowl appearance, third as a Los
                          Angeles-based team, and second under McVay. The franchise held a 1–3 Super Bowl record prior to the
                          game, winning Super Bowl XXXIV in 1999 as the St. Louis Rams.

                          Lost Ark was fully released in South Korea on December 4, 2019, and in North American, South
                          American, and European regions on February 11, 2022, with Amazon Games serving as the global
                          publisher.[16] Users that pre-purchased one of four founder's packs could play 3 days early on
                          February 8, 2022.[17][18][19][20] The game was initially unavailable in Belgium and the Netherlands
                          due to the countries' stringent loot box regulations,[21] with the latter later reversing its
                          decision.[22] Within twenty-four hours of its release, Lost Ark became the second most played game
                          on Steam.[23][24] In 2021, there were plans between Smilegate and game publisher HappyTuk [zh] to
                          launch Lost Ark in Taiwan.[25] It was announced in 2023 that the release of Taiwanese servers has
                          been delayed but not canceled.[26] Lost Ark received "generally favorable" reviews according to
                          review aggregator Metacritic.[27] PC Magazine praised Lost Ark's combat, writing, "Abilities look
                          good, sound sufficiently powerful, and feel great to use. You can’t help but feel like a combat god

                          Den of Geek Ad Lost Ark is one of Steam's biggest hits in a long time, but what time will you be
                          able to play the free-to-play version of the game? Lost Ark is quickly proving to be one of Steam’s
                          biggest hits of 2022, but the game’s complicated release structure has many people wondering what
                          time the red hot title will fully be released and when they’ll be able to join the millions that
                          are already exploring the game that has a lot of people talking. Originally released (in full) in
                          South Korea in 2019, Lost Ark is an MMORPG with Diablo-like ARPG combat. The game quickly grew a
                          sizeable fanbase in that region thanks to its PvP mechanics, extensive content offerings, cinematic
                          style, and all those other MMO tropes that usually encourage people to gleefully spend a few
                          hundred hours of their lives playing them. So, while Lost Ark has been playable in South Korea and
                          other regions for quite some time, those in the West who recently pre-ordered any of the Lost Ark
                          Founder’s Pack on Steam were also able to start playing the game yesterday (February 8). You’re
                          still able to start playing the game right now if you decide to buy a Founder’s Pack for the MMO
                          via Steam (each of which comes with a variety of in-game rewards as well as early access to the
                          title).

                          golden age, and it seems that almost every network wants to have one of its own. It’s actually easy
                          to see why the genre would continue to maintain its popularity. RELATED: 10 Thriller Movies With
                          The Best Re-Watch Value More than almost any other genre, it aims to keep the audience on the edge
                          of their seat, constantly wondering just what’s going to happen and how the mystery (or mysteries)
                          will ultimately be resolved. The Endgame is the newest thriller to grace NBC, and it joins a large
                          number of similar series, both on that network and elsewhere. There is much about The Blacklist
                          that will appeal to those who also enjoyed The Endgame. Most notably, there is the central conflict
                          between its two main characters, Raymond Reddington and Elizabeth Keene. It’s a densely woven
                          series, with a number of enigmas and mysteries that it constantly keeps in the air. There’s no
                          denying, though, that a major part of its appeal stems from James Spader’s scenery-chewing
                          performance as the enigmatic yet compelling Reddington, and it remains one of his best roles.
                          American popular culture has an enduring fascination with the figure of the drug lord, and there
                          are few drug lords who are as renowned as Pablo Escobar.

                          Related Attacks on civilians On 24 February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine in an escalation of the
                          Russo-Ukrainian War which began in 2014. The invasion has killed tens of thousands on both sides.
                          Russian forces have been responsible for mass civilian casualties and for torturing captured
                          Ukrainian soldiers. By June 2022, about 8 million Ukrainians had been internally displaced. More
                          than 8.2 million had fled the country by May 2023, becoming Europe's largest refugee crisis since
                          World War II. Extensive environmental damage, widely described as ecocide, contributed to food
                          crises worldwide. Prior to the invasion, Russian troops concentrated near Ukraine's borders, as
                          Russian officials denied plans to attack. Vladimir Putin announced a "special military operation"
                          to support the breakaway republics of Donetsk and Luhansk, whose military forces were fighting
                          Ukraine in the Donbas conflict, claiming the goal was to "demilitarise" and "denazify" Ukraine.
                          Putin espoused irredentist views, challenged Ukraine's right to exist, and falsely claimed that
                          Ukraine was governed by neo-Nazis persecuting the ethnic Russian minority.

                          In mid-December 2021, Russia’s foreign ministry called on the United States and NATO to cease
                          military activity in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, commit to no further NATO expansion toward
                          Russia, and prevent Ukraine from joining NATO in the future. The United States and other NATO
                          allies rejected these demands and threatened to impose severe economic sanctions if Russia took
                          aggressive action against Ukraine. In early February 2022, satellite imagery showed the largest
                          deployment of Russian troops to its border with Belarus since the end of the Cold War. Negotiations
                          between the United States, Russia, and European powers—including France and Germany—failed to bring
                          about a resolution. In late February 2022, the United States warned that Russia intended to invade
                          Ukraine, citing Russia’s growing military presence at the Russia-Ukraine border. President Putin
                          then ordered troops to Luhansk and Donetsk, claiming the troops served a “peacekeeping” function.
                          The United States responded by imposing sanctions on the regions and the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline
                          a few days later. Nevertheless, just prior to the invasion, U.S. and Ukrainian leaders remained at
                          odds regarding the nature and likelihood of an armed Russian threat, with Ukrainian officials
                          playing down the possibility of an incursion and delaying the mobilization of their troops and
                          reserve forces.

                          Filed under: FromSoftware and George R.R. Martin’s long-awaited game arrives in 2022 Elden Ring,
                          the long-awaited new game from Dark Souls developer FromSoftware, has finally come out of hiding.
                          Publisher Bandai Namco gave fans a new look at the epic fantasy role-playing game during Thursday’s
                          Summer Game Fest Kickoff Live stream. The new trailer for Elden Ring showed gameplay for the first
                          time, gameplay that will look very familiar to fans of Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and Sekiro: Shadows
                          Die Twice. We also got a release date — Jan. 21, 2022 — and platforms. Elden Ring is coming to
                          current-gen and last-gen consoles, as well as PC. Elden Ring appears to have many elements familiar
                          to Dark Souls players: swords and sorcery, summonable allies, and giant mythical monsters to
                          battle. But it also has something fans of FromSoftware aren’t accustomed to: horses! Check out new
                          4K images of Elden Ring in the gallery below. The last time we heard anything about Elden Ring was
                          in June 2019, when Bandai Namco and FromSoftware officially revealed the game.

                          Iga Swiatek has done it again. For the second time this year, she’s standing at the top of a
                          podium, holding a Grand Slam trophy above her head. This time, she defeated Ons Jabeur 6-2, 7-6(5)
                          to win the 2022 US Open, capping off a year of incredible and unexpected success. Swiatek, who
                          looked extremely nervous before the match began, looked anything but once the rackets started
                          swinging. She came out strong, showing off all the skills we know her for: explosive movement,
                          pinpoint precision and a soft touch. By comparison, Jabeur, who looked comfortable and happy before
                          the match started, came out looking flat and tentative. It wasn't until Swiatek was up 3-0 that
                          Jabeur got on the board. Then, in the fifth game of the first set, Jabeur hit four winners, each
                          one perfectly placed along the singles sideline. All Swiatek could do with those is watch them
                          bounce as Jabeur narrowed the gap at 3-2. Unfortunately, that was the last game Jabeur won in the
                          first set. Swiatek was able to reach balls that most people couldn't even try for, while Jabeur
                          couldn't stop hitting the ball into the net at the most vital moments. Swiatek claimed the first
                          set in 30 minutes flat, and made it look as effortless as ever.

                          The second set was entirely different from the first. While Jabeur again didn't win a game until
                          Swiatek was up 3-0, she finally found her gear. Her excellent slice finally began to appear and she
                          began going to the net more, helping her win four of the next five games. Swiatek appeared to have
                          finally wrestled the momentum of the match back to her side, breaking a 5-5 tie to get within one
                          game of the title, but she couldn't close and Jabeur tied it up once again. The tiebreak was close,
                          and it looked like Jabeur could run away with it at any moment, but an unforced error from Jabeur
                          ended the tiebreak and gave Swiatek her first US Open championship and her third career Grand Slam
                          trophy. When it was all over, Swiatek and Jabeur shared a heartfelt embrace, and then Swiatek
                          immediately burst into happy tears. She'd earned it. This victory puts an exclamation point on the
                          best year of Swiatek's young career — or the best year of anyone’s career, really. She started 2022
                          by falling just short of the finals at the Australian Open (she was knocked out in the semis by
                          Danielle Collins), but she rebounded to produce one of the most dominant stretches of tennis we’ve
                          seen in decades. Swiatek beat Annet Kontaveit to win the Qatar Open.

Question 32              : Who won the Male Vocalist of the Year at the 2022 CMA ?
Correct Answers         :  
                          Chris Stapleton
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - Answer              : Chris Stapleton
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          Chris Stapleton won the trophy for Male Vocalist of the Year at the 2022 CMA Awards, beating out
                          fellow nominees Eric Church, Luke Combs, Cody Johnson and Morgan Wallen. Visibly moved by the win,
                          Stapleton used the opportunity to share his appreciation with those who have supported his career
                          through the years. "This is a dream every minute we get to live this," he told the crowd during his
                          acceptance speech. "I'm evidence that dreams come true all the time, so thank you, thank you to
                          everybody." Stapleton's Wednesday night win marks the second consecutive year that he has won the
                          Male Vocalist of the Year trophy, and his sixth win in the category overall. From 2015 to 2018, the
                          singer had a hot streak as Male Vocalist, but Combs toppled his reign for two years in 2019 and
                          2020. Still, in 2022, Stapleton's steady traditionalism and consistency as a live act won the day.
                          Together with his All-American Road Show, the singer has been one of country music's most prolific
                          and reliable touring acts this year, and he is even the subject of a current Country Music Hall of
                          Fame exhibit. Early in the year, he won three Grammy Awards, including Best Country Album for his
                          late 2020 project, Starting Over. The 2022 CMA Awards aired live from Nashville's Bridgestone Arena

                          The 2022 ACC men's basketball tournament (officially the 2022 New York Life ACC Men's Basketball
                          Tournament, for sponsorship reasons) was the postseason men's basketball tournament for the 2021–22
                          Atlantic Coast Conference men's basketball season. It was held at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn,
                          New York, during March 8–12, 2022.[1] The 2022 tournament was the 69th annual edition of the
                          tournament. The Virginia Tech Hokies won the tournament, their first ACC Tournament title and only
                          their second conference tournament title in program history, receiving the conference's automatic
                          bid to the 2022 NCAA tournament. The Hokies were the second ACC champion to win four tournament
                          games to secure the title and were the lowest overall seed to win the title.[2] All 15 ACC teams
                          participate in the tournament. Teams were seeded by conference record, with a tiebreaker system to
                          seed teams that finished with identical conference records.[3] Duke secured the regular season
                          title and the first overall seed. Notre Dame, North Carolina, and Miami were the other teams to
                          secure double-byes.[4] ‡ – ACC Regular Season Champions.† – Received a double-bye in the conference

                          With the win, Carolina owns a 14-11 advantage over the Pack in the ACC tournament. UNC is 3-1
                          against N.C. State this season. Ninety minutes before the first pitch, fans in blue or red tops
                          made their way through the concourse, eventually filling up the bleachers at Truist Field. In 2013,
                          11,392 fans packed the DPAC in Durham to watch the rivals play in the ACC tournament. Sunday,
                          10,500 made their way into Truist Field, setting a tournament record for the venue, with local
                          Carolina fans still scooping up tickets late into the game. N.C. State, the first double-digit
                          seeded team to make the final, scored 28 runs in their previous three games this week. After being
                          shut out last year against Duke in the title game, the Pack got on the board in the first inning.
                          It was downhill from there. N.C. State’s Devonte Brown ripped a double on the second pitch of the
                          game. He looked to the Wolfpack dugout and there was a brief celebration. Brown later scored on a
                          controversial play. The umpires took a second look to see if Brown actually tagged third base on
                          his way by. He had, and N.C. State grabbed the lead. Then, UNC took the plate. Honeycutt hit his
                          19th home run of the season, a two-run shot over the Piedmont Natural Gas picnic area.

Question 34              : What chip does the iPhone 14 have?
Correct Answers         :  
                          A15
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prediction (only positive):
  - Answer              : A16
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          Apple's new A16 Bionic chip in the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max costs $110 to produce,
                          making it over 2.4× as costly as the A15 chip in iPhone 13 Pro models released last year, according
                          to a Nikkei Asia report. The A16's higher cost is likely due in part to the chip being manufactured
                          based on TSMC's 4nm process, while the A15 is a 5nm chip. iPhone chips could continue to increase
                          in price as miniaturization continues, with rumors suggesting the A17 chip in iPhone 15 Pro models
                          will be based on TSMC's 3nm process, and a DigiTimes report this week claiming that TSMC will begin
                          volume production of 2nm chips in 2025. Geekbench 5 benchmark results indicate the A16 chip
                          delivers around 15% to 17% faster multi-core performance compared to the A15 chip. Only the iPhone
                          14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max are equipped with the A16 chip, while the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus
                          have the same A15 chip with a five-core GPU as found in iPhone 13 Pro models.

                          Google has released the Google I/O 2022 schedule, giving us a brief overview of what to expect.
                          Read on to know more. We’re just two weeks away from Google I/O 2022. While the yearly event is
                          primarily targeted at developers, there will be plenty of fun stuff for enthusiasts and the general
                          public. Google usually doesn’t reveal much about what it plans to announce at the event. However,
                          the company has now released the Google I/O 2022 schedule, giving us a brief overview of what to
                          expect. Google I/O 2022 will be held on May 11 and May 12 at the Shoreline Amphitheater. The event
                          will kick off with Sundar Pichai’s “Google I/O keynote” at 10 AM. This will be the main attraction
                          for the general population as the main event tends to be more consumer-focused. While the event’s
                          description doesn’t provide specifics, expect to see announcements for popular Google services,
                          Workspace, privacy, health, and Google’s other new projects and endeavors. Also, keep an eye out
                          for potential hardware announcements in the form of the Pixel 6a, Pixel Watch, and smart home
                          devices. The main keynote will be followed by the Developer keynote and “What’s new in Android.”
                          This is where we expect to learn more about Android 13, Wear OS, and updates to developer products
                          and tools. Google says the schedule is slightly different this year.

                          actor Leslie Grace, Michael Keaton and Brendan Fraser will not be released at all, Warner Bros
                          Discovery has unexpectedly announced, despite shooting already being completed and the film being
                          in post-production. Directed by Ms Marvel directors Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah, the film was
                          initially greenlit in 2021 as part of a wider move at Warner Bros to create feature films
                          specifically for the streaming service HBO Max. But the studio confirmed on Tuesday that the film
                          would never get any release, either theatrically or on HBO Max. It declined to provide further
                          comment. Batgirl was to have Keaton reprise his role as Batman, alongside Grace as the titular hero
                          Barbara Gordon, JK Simmons as Barbara’s father, Commissioner Gordon, and Fraser as the villain
                          Firefly. The Hollywood Reporter said Batgirl’s budget was a factor in the decision, having risen to
                          nearly $90m (£74.1m, A$130m) due to costs relating to it being shot during the Covid-19 pandemic.
                          While the budget is lower than the average DC superhero film, it was reportedly decided that it did
                          not have the “spectacle that audiences have come to expect from DC fare” and would not recoup its
                          losses from being released.

                          On December 31, 2021, the Tianwen-1 orbiter deployed a second deployable camera (TDC-2) into Mars
                          orbit which captured photographs of the Tianwen-1 in orbit to celebrate its achievement of the
                          year[20] and a selfie stick payload was deployed to its working position on orbiter to take images
                          of the orbiter's components and Chinese flag on 30 January 2022 to celebrate the Chinese New Year.
                          In September 2022, the mission was awarded the World Space Award by the International Astronautical
                          Federation.[35][36] The Tianwen-1 mission was the second of three Martian exploration missions
                          launched during the July 2020 window, after the United Arab Emirates Space Agency's Hope orbiter,
                          and before NASA's Mars 2020 mission, which landed the Perseverance rover with the attached
                          Ingenuity helicopter drone.[37] China's planetary exploration program is officially dubbed the
                          "Tianwen Series". "Tianwen-1" (Chinese: 天问一号) is the program's first mission, and subsequent
                          planetary missions will be numbered sequentially.[38] The name Tianwen means "questions to heaven"
                          or "quest for heavenly truth", from the same classical poem written by Qu Yuan (c. 340–278 BC), an
                          ancient Chinese poet.

                          Shad Gaspard has been posthumously named the recipient of the 2022 Warrior Award. Named after WWE
                          Hall of Famer The Ultimate Warrior, The Warrior Award is presented to an individual who has
                          exhibited unwavering strength and perseverance and who lives life with the courage and compassion
                          that embodies the indomitable spirit of The Ultimate Warrior. The news was first reported by
                          Foxsports.com. The Warrior Award presentation will be part of the WWE Hall of Fame Induction
                          Ceremony, Friday, April 1, at American Airlines Center in Dallas as part of WrestleMania Week. The
                          event will stream live exclusively on Peacock in the U.S. and WWE Network everywhere else. A
                          larger-than-life Superstar with boundless charisma, Shad passed away on May 17, 2020. While
                          swimming with his son, the pair got caught in a strong current in Venice Beach, Cal. In a heroic
                          act of love, the concerned father instructed lifeguards to save his son before himself and
                          disappeared soon after. Days later, his passing was confirmed. He was 39 years old. Shad’s bravery
                          and selflessness will be honored next Friday with the 2022 Warrior Award as part of the 2022 WWE
                          Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony. WWE Global Ambassador Titus O’Neil has been named the recipient of
                          the 2020 Warrior Award. Longtime WWE employee Rich Hering has been named the recipient of the 2021
                          Warrior Award.

                          This new ratio is more akin to the sizing of a sheet of A4 paper, making it a more familiar viewing
                          experience that enhances student productivity. The bezels are also a little thicker than other
                          Surface devices, a design feature no doubt added to keep sticky fingers off the display. Weight |
                          The device weighs in at 1.1 kg, making it easy for students to carry around in their backpacks.
                          Given it’s a clamshell, it does top the weight of, say, the Surface Go 3 which comes in at 544gms,
                          but is equal in weight to the Surface Laptop Go 2. Chassis | The kid-friendly plastic chassis comes
                          in a glacier white colorway. It’s smooth and minimal, however we’re still to be convinced if white
                          is the best colour choice for a laptop that is likely to endure more than its fair share of bumps
                          and scrapes. If the chassis does get damaged, schools are provided with ‘fixer tool kits’ to help
                          repair the plastic casing. There are also visible screws on the case so IT can quickly replace
                          major components such as the keyboard, without disrupting learning time. Keyboard | The keyboard is
                          not backlit, but the keys have a slight texture that makes typing easy and the touchpad is
                          accurate. While it’s not premium like you’d find on other Surface devices, it’s great for the price
                          point.

                          Filed under: What the American Oscars telecast cut from the Will Smith-Chris Rock confrontation.
                          Will Smith has been banned from the Oscars for 10 years after slapping Chris Rock live on camera
                          during the award show, the New York Times reports. The incident came in the final hour of an
                          otherwise sleepy Oscars telecast on March 27. Rock made a joke about Smith’s wife, Jada Pinkett
                          Smith, and Smith took the stage and slapped him. Minutes later, Smith won his first ever Oscar. “I
                          did not know this was gonna be the most exciting Oscars ever,” marveled Diddy shortly after. “This
                          action we are taking today in response to Will Smith’s behavior is a step toward a larger goal of
                          protecting the safety of our performers and guests, and restoring trust in the Academy,” the
                          Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences said in an open letter on April 8. “We also hope this
                          can begin a time of healing and restoration for all involved and impacted.” Smith, who resigned
                          from the Academy on April 1, said in a statement, “I accept and respect the Academy’s decision.”
                          Here’s what happened. Chris Rock was appearing at the Oscars to announce the winner for Best
                          Documentary. In the leadup to announcing the nominees, he went through a little comedic patter
                          about some of the nominees, and his attention appeared to snag on Smith’s wife, Jada Pinkett Smith,
                          sitting in front in a green gown with a shaved head.

Question 42              : When did Apple M2 chip?

                          Apple M2 is a series of ARM-based system on a chip (SoC) designed by Apple Inc. as a central
                          processing unit (CPU) and graphics processing unit (GPU) for its Mac desktops and notebooks, and
                          the iPad Pro tablet. It is the second generation of ARM architecture intended for Apple's Mac
                          computers after switching from Intel Core to Apple silicon, succeeding the M1. Apple announced the
                          M2 on June 6, 2022, at WWDC, along with models of the MacBook Air and the 13-inch MacBook Pro using
                          the M2. The M2 is made with TSMC's "Enhanced 5-nanometer technology" N5P process and contains 20
                          billion transistors, a 25% increase from the M1. Apple claims CPU improvements up to 18% and GPU
                          improvements up to 35% compared to the M1.[3] The M2 was followed by the professional-focused M2
                          Pro and M2 Max chips in January 2023. The M2 Max is a higher-powered version of the M2 Pro, with
                          more GPU cores and memory bandwidth, and a larger die size.[4] Apple introduced the M2 Ultra in
                          June 2023, combining two M2 Max chips in one package.[1]

                          Apple in June 2022 unveiled the M2, its next-generation Apple silicon chip that followed the M1
                          chip. This guide highlights everything you need to know about the M2 chip, from performance
                          improvements to extra features. The M2 is Apple's next-generation System on a Chip (SoC) developed
                          for use in Macs and iPads. It marks Apple's continued work to transition away from the Intel chips
                          that were used in Macs up until 2020. As a "System on a Chip," the M2 integrates several different
                          components, including the CPU, GPU, unified memory architecture (RAM), Neural Engine, Secure
                          Enclave, SSD controller, image signal processor, encode/decode engines, Thunderbolt controller with
                          USB 4 support, and more, all of which power the different features in the Mac. Before Apple
                          silicon, Macs used multiple chips for CPU, I/O, and security, but Apple's effort to integrate these
                          chips is the reason why the M2 is much faster and more efficient than Intel chips. The unified
                          memory architecture that Apple has included is also a major factor because all of the technologies
                          in the M2 are able to access the same data without having to swap between multiple pools of memory.
                          Built into the M2 chip, the unified memory architecture means the CPU, GPU, and other processor
                          components don't need to copy data between one another, and are able to access the same data pool.

                          From the Earth to the Moon: A Direct Route in 97 Hours, 20 Minutes (French: De la Terre à la Lune,
                          trajet direct en 97 heures 20 minutes) is an 1865 novel by Jules Verne. It tells the story of the
                          Baltimore Gun Club, a post-American Civil War society of weapons enthusiasts, and their attempts to
                          build an enormous Columbiad space gun and launch three people—the Gun Club's president, his
                          Philadelphian armor-making rival, and a French poet—in a projectile with the goal of a Moon
                          landing. Five years later, Verne wrote a sequel called Around the Moon. The story is also notable
                          in that Verne attempted to do some rough calculations as to the requirements for the cannon and in
                          that, considering the comparative lack of empirical data on the subject at the time, some of his
                          figures are remarkably accurate. However, his version of a space gun for a non-rocket spacelaunch
                          turned out to be impractical for safe human space travel since a much longer barrel would have been
                          required to reach escape velocity while limiting acceleration to survivable limits for the
                          passengers. The character of Michel Ardan, the French member of the party in the novel, was
                          inspired by the real-life photographer Félix Nadar. The story opens some time after the end of the
                          American Civil War.

Question 47              : When is the final of the 2022 FIFA World Cup?

                          371] On 24 February 2015, the FIFA Task Force proposed that the tournament be played from late
                          November to late December 2022,[372] to avoid the summer heat between May and September and also
                          avoid clashing with the 2022 Winter Olympics in February, the 2022 Winter Paralympics in March and
                          Ramadan in April.[373][374] The notion of staging the tournament in November was controversial
                          because it would interfere with the regular season schedules of some domestic leagues around the
                          world. Commentators noted the clash with the Christian Christmas season was likely to cause
                          disruption, whilst there was concern about how short the tournament was intended to be.[375] FIFA
                          executive committee member Theo Zwanziger said that awarding the 2022 World Cup to Qatar was a
                          "blatant mistake".[376] Frank Lowy, chairman of Football Federation Australia, said that if the
                          2022 World Cup were moved to November and thus upset the schedule of the A-League, they would seek
                          compensation from FIFA.[377] Richard Scudamore, chief executive of the Premier League, stated that
                          they would consider legal action against FIFA because a move would interfere with the Premier
                          League's popular Christmas and New Year fixture programme.[378] On 19 March 2015, FIFA sources
                          confirmed that the final would be played on 18 December.[379]

                          [18] Antoine Griezmann opened the scoring with a penalty before Ángel Di María and Gabriel Mercado
                          put Argentina in front, with France then scoring the next three goals courtesy of Benjamin Pavard's
                          volley outside of the box – which was later voted as the goal of the tournament[19] – and then
                          Kylian Mbappé twice.[20] Sergio Agüero reduced the deficit to one in stoppage time, but Argentina
                          was unable to equalise and send the match to extra time.[21] The match ball for the 2022 FIFA World
                          Cup semi-finals, third place match and final was announced on 11 December 2022. It was a variation
                          of the Adidas Al Rihla used in the rest of the tournament named the Adidas Al-Hilm, meaning "The
                          Dream" in Arabic, a reference to every nation's dream of lifting the FIFA World Cup.[22] Whilst the
                          technical aspects of the ball are the same, the colour is different from the Al-Rihla balls used in
                          the group stages and preceding knockout games, with a Gold Metallic, maroon, Collegiate Burgundy,
                          and red design, a reference to the national colours of host nation Qatar and the golden colours
                          shared by the final's venue Lusail Stadium and the FIFA World Cup Trophy.

                          Twitter, Inc. (NYSE: TWTR) today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to be
                          acquired by an entity wholly owned by Elon Musk, for $54.20 per share in cash in a transaction
                          valued at approximately $44 billion. Upon completion of the transaction, Twitter will become a
                          privately held company. Under the terms of the agreement, Twitter stockholders will receive $54.20
                          in cash for each share of Twitter common stock that they own upon closing of the proposed
                          transaction. The purchase price represents a 38% premium to Twitter's closing stock price on April
                          1, 2022, which was the last trading day before Mr. Musk disclosed his approximately 9% stake in
                          Twitter. Bret Taylor, Twitter's Independent Board Chair, said, "The Twitter Board conducted a
                          thoughtful and comprehensive process to assess Elon's proposal with a deliberate focus on value,
                          certainty, and financing. The proposed transaction will deliver a substantial cash premium, and we
                          believe it is the best path forward for Twitter's stockholders." Parag Agrawal, Twitter's CEO,
                          said, "Twitter has a purpose and relevance that impacts the entire world.

                          These included misrepresentations to Musk made during the course of the acquisition bid, with the
                          complaint specifically calling Agrawal's May 16 thread deceptive.[101][102][103] In a July 7
                          conference call, Twitter revealed that over one million spam accounts were removed daily, and
                          reiterated that it was impossible to externally determine the exact number of these accounts as it
                          would involve private user data.[104] That same day, The Washington Post reported that the deal was
                          "in peril" amid a slowdown in discussions on funding.[105] On July 8, Musk announced his intention
                          to terminate the proposed acquisition, claiming in a regulatory filing that Twitter was in
                          "material breach" of several parts of the agreement by refusing to comply with Musk's requests for
                          spambot account data and dismissing high-ranking employees.[106][107] In response, Taylor pledged
                          to pursue legal action against Musk at the Delaware Court of Chancery with the goal of completing
                          the acquisition,[108][109] with the ensuing lawsuit once again overseen by the Twitter board's
                          transaction committee.[46] Twitter's stock sank by 7 percent after the news, dropping by a further
                          11 percent the next day.

Question 50              : How much did Elon Musk bought Twitter?
Correct Answers         :

                          At least one of the executives who was fired was escorted out of Twitter’s office, they said. Mr.
                          Musk, who is one of Twitter’s most active users and has more than 109 million followers, began
                          accumulating shares in the company this year. In April, he struck the deal to buy the company for
                          $44 billion and said he would lift Twitter’s content moderation policies, eliminate spam, add new
                          features and provide more transparency about the algorithms used to promote content. “Twitter has
                          tremendous potential — I look forward to working with the company and the community of users to
                          unlock it,” he said in a statement in April. But, within weeks, he began questioning the deal. Mr.
                          Musk lashed out at the Twitter executives responsible for content decisions and accused the company
                          of failing to accurately count the spam accounts on its platform. When Parag Agrawal, Twitter’s
                          chief executive, tried debunking Mr. Musk’s claims, Mr. Musk responded by tweeting a poop emoji. By
                          July, Mr. Musk had decided that he no longer wanted to own Twitter, arguing that he had been misled
                          about the amount of spam on the platform. He announced his intent to abandon the acquisition.
                          Twitter sued Mr. Musk to force him to carry out the agreement. The company accused Mr. Musk of
                          trying to back out of the deal because the economic downturn had caused a decline in his personal
                          wealth. Mr. Musk had agreed to personally provide roughly $33 billion of the $44 billion deal.

                          composed of Taylor, Martha Lane Fox, and Patrick Pichette.[46] The deal would require shareholder
                          and regulatory approval before it could be finalized,[47] though analysts believed it was unlikely
                          to be challenged by regulators.[48] Musk was barred from disparaging the company or its employees
                          when tweeting about the acquisition before the transaction closed.[49] The agreement also
                          stipulated that if Musk failed to close the acquisition, he would be required to pay Twitter a $1
                          billion breakup fee.

                          Over the next several hours, Scheffler, 25, rebuffed every challenge with the same aplomb to claim
                          his first major championship, running away to win the 2022 Masters by three strokes. His margin of
                          victory would have been larger but for a final show of some nerves during the tournament’s closing
                          sequence on the 18th green, when Scheffler needed four putts, including three from less than five
                          feet, to close out a round of 71. Scheffler finished 10 under par for the tournament, in just his
                          third Masters appearance. Rory McIlroy, who trailed Scheffler by 10 strokes heading into the final
                          round, finished second after an eight-under-par 64. Smith and Shane Lowry tied for third, five
                          strokes off the lead. Speaking with reporters after donning the ceremonial green jacket awarded to
                          Masters winners, Scheffler talked of feeling calm on the course during the final round but said he
                          was “so stressed out” on Sunday morning. “I cried like a baby,” he said. “I was so overwhelmed.”
                          Scheffler added that he told his wife, Meredith, “I don’t think I’m ready for this.” Scheffler said
                          he could not recall any previous episodes of self-doubt and attributed it to an understanding of
                          how much winning the Masters would mean to him. “I’ve felt at peace on the golf course,” he said,
                          laughing.

                          Aryna Sabalenka defeated Elena Rybakina in the final, 4–6, 6–3, 6–4 to win the women's singles
                          tennis title at the 2023 Australian Open. It was her first major singles title.[1] Sabalenka
                          dropped just one set during the tournament, to Rybakina in the championship match. Rybakina became
                          the first Kazakhstani player to progress past the fourth round, and the first player since Jennifer
                          Capriati in 2001 to defeat three consecutive major champions in a single edition of the Australian
                          Open.[2] By reaching the final, Rybakina made her debut in the top ten of the WTA Rankings.
                          Ashleigh Barty was the reigning champion,[3] but she retired from professional tennis in March
                          2022.[4] Barty's retirement and Angelique Kerber and Naomi Osaka’s absences (both due to pregnancy)
                          meant that Victoria Azarenka and Sofia Kenin were the only former champions left in the draw. They
                          met in the first round, with Azarenka winning in straight sets.[5] Jeļena Ostapenko became the
                          first Latvian to reach the Australian Open quarterfinals.[6] Click on the seed number of a player

                          Up 40-0 in no time. Sabalenka draws a backhand error from Rybakina. Sabalenka takes it to 30-40 but
                          Rybakina manages to hold with a service winner down the T. A one-set shoot-off to decide the winner
                          of the 2023 Australian Open. There could not have been a better script. Sabalenka* 6-3 Rybakina -
                          Wide second serve into the deuce court from Sabalenka and forehand return from Rybakina is long.
                          Deep backhand crosscourt return from Rybakina draws a shot ball from Sabalenka and Rybakina
                          finishes the point with a crosscourt forehand winner - 15-all. Wide serve into the deuce court and
                          yet again, Rybakina’s forehand return is beyond the baseline. Rybakina reads the crosscourt drop
                          shot from Sabalenka and finishes the point with a backhand winner down the line - 30-all. A T ace
                          from Sabalenka and she has her third set point. A T ace on second serve and Sabalenka wins second
                          set 6-3! Sabalenka 5-3 Rybakina* - Rybakina serving to stay in the set. The Kazakh misses the inner
                          sideline by a whisker as she goes for an inside-out backhand. Deep backhand return from Sabalenka
                          and Rybakina’s backhand in reply is well long.

                          Rafael Nadal defeated Daniil Medvedev in the final, 2–6, 6–7(5–7), 6–4, 6–4, 7–5 to win the men's
                          singles tennis title at the 2022 Australian Open.[1] It was his second Australian Open title and
                          21st major singles title overall, surpassing the all-time record he had jointly held with Roger
                          Federer and Novak Djokovic.[2][3] Nadal became the fourth man, after Roy Emerson, Rod Laver, and
                          Djokovic, to achieve the double career Grand Slam, and the second in the Open Era.[4] He also
                          became the first man in the Open Era to win an Australian Open final after losing the first two
                          sets.[5] This marked the third consecutive year a man trailed by two sets in a major final yet
                          rallied to win, following Djokovic's two-set comeback at the 2021 French Open and Dominic Thiem's
                          at the 2020 US Open.[6] Djokovic was the three-time reigning champion,[7] but did not compete after
                          his visa was cancelled shortly before the tournament began due to an intervention from Australia's
                          Immigration Minister Alex Hawke, citing risks to public health and good order in Australia.[8] That
                          meant Nadal was the only former champion (2009) to compete in the tournament, with both Federer and
                          Stan Wawrinka sidelined by injury.

                          Given everything, Djokovic is still the favorite. Stubbs: Djokovic. I think he has so much to prove
                          after what happened to him last year. I believe, like Nadal in Paris, he feels invincible in
                          Melbourne over five sets. Wozniacki: I think Djokovic will win. When you come back to a place where
                          you have won this much, it will give you a huge edge when things get close in a match. Connelly:
                          The question isn't necessarily who will win, it's whether Djokovic's odds are even better than
                          Swiatek's. The men's tour is a bit of a mess right now -- a fun mess, but a mess. Alcaraz is
                          injured. Nadal is still looking for his post-injury form and has lost six of his past seven
                          tour-level matches going back to his loss to Frances Tiafoe in the U.S. Open. Daniil Medvedev had
                          his worst overall win percentage in four years in 2022 (70%) and lost in straight sets to Djokovic
                          in Adelaide. Ruud made the US Open final, but he has lost seven of his past 12 matches. In each of
                          the quarters of the bracket that don't include Djokovic, we could see loads of drama and plot
                          twists.

                          With Rafael Nadal out through injury, the French Open 2023 could see a new name on the famous
                          trophy in the men's draw — a trophy won by only four different players since 2004. Iga Swiatek,
                          Barbora Krejcikova and Jelena Ostapenko are hoping to repeat their past triumphs in the women's
                          singles when the action begins on May 28. Australian Open champion Aryna Sabalenka and men's world
                          No.1 Carlos Alcaraz are among the players hoping to go all the way at Roland-Garros for the first
                          time. Whose footsteps will the champions be following? Here's who won last year and a list of

                          singles title? Rafael Nadal was the 2022 French Open champion, winning his 22nd and most recent
                          grand slam title. Novak Djokovic ended Nadal's run of five straight French Opens in 2021 but the
                          Spanish superstar returned to beat his arch-rival in four sets in the quarterfinals in last year. A
                          brutal mid-match injury to Alexander Zverev sent Nadal through to a final he won in straight sets
                          against Casper Ruud, extending his record to 14 French Open titles and 22 majors in total.

                          Iga Świątek defeated Coco Gauff in the final, 6–1, 6–3 to win the women's singles tennis title at
                          the 2022 French Open.[1] It was her second French Open title, and she dropped just one set en
                          route, in the fourth round to Zheng Qinwen. With the win, Świątek extended her winning streak to 35
                          matches (dating back to the Qatar Open in February), equaling Venus Williams' tally from the 2000
                          season.[2] Świątek also became the youngest winner of multiple majors since Maria Sharapova in
                          2006.[3] Barbora Krejčíková was the defending champion,[4] but she lost in the first round to Diane
                          Parry. This marked only the third time in French Open history that the defending champion lost in
                          the first round (after Anastasia Myskina in 2005 and Jeļena Ostapenko in 2018), and the record
                          fifteenth consecutive unsuccessful French Open women's singles title defense since 2007.[5]
                          17-year-old Linda Nosková became the youngest qualifier to debut in the main draw since Michelle
                          Larcher de Brito in 2009.[6][7][8][9] This was the second time in the Open Era when only one out of
                          the top ten seeds advanced to the fourth round of a major, after 2018 Wimbledon.[10]

                          Gauff, an 18-year-old from Delray Beach, Florida, was disappointed after the loss, but talked about
                          how this match -- and her run to the final -- has helped boost her confidence. "For a while I
                          really believed I couldn't do it just because ever since I was 15 and I first came on people had so
                          much expectations for me and I started to believe that I couldn't do it and you know I made a final
                          and I wasn't expecting it and I know that I'll get this opportunity again and I hope that I can
                          come out on top next time. The numbers tell the story of a dominant and composed match for Swiatek
                          -- which was the story of her tournament and could be the tag line for her last three months of
                          tennis. 73% first serves in, 72% win rate on first serves, 5-for-10 in break point chances, just 16
                          unforced errors. On the other side of the court Gauff struggled on her first serve, winning just
                          46% of her first serve points and coming away with three double faults and 23 unforced errors and
                          21 forced errors. The next big tournament on the tennis calendar is Wimbledon, which starts June
                          27. Ash Barty, who retired earlier this year, won the women's singles in 2021.

                          her racket and brought her hands to her eyes, as Muchova came around the net for a well-earned

Question 60              : Who won the men's singles French Open 2023?

                          Novak Djokovic defeated Casper Ruud in the final, 7–6(7–1), 6–3, 7–5 to win the men's singles
                          tennis title at the 2023 French Open. It was his third French Open title and his record-breaking
                          23rd men's singles major title overall, surpassing the record he previously held jointly with
                          Rafael Nadal.[1] With the victory, Djokovic became the first man to achieve a triple career Grand
                          Slam, and became the oldest French Open champion at the age of 36 years and 20 days.[2] Nadal was
                          the reigning champion,[3] but withdrew due to a left hip injury. This was the first time the
                          14-time champion missed the tournament since his debut in 2005.[4] With his withdrawal, Nadal fell
                          out of the top 100 of the ATP rankings for the first time since 2003.[5] By winning the title,
                          Djokovic reclaimed the world No. 1 singles ranking from Carlos Alcaraz; Daniil Medvedev and
                          Stefanos Tsitsipas were also in contention for the top ranking at the beginning of the
                          tournament.[6][7] Medvedev's loss to Thiago Seyboth Wild in the first round marked the first time
                          since 2000 that the second seed (then Pete Sampras) lost in the opening round.

                          While he still covers the court with more flexibility and ease than most athletes at their physical
                          peak, these achievements at his age have only added another layer to his greatness. Djokovic is now
                          the oldest Roland Garros singles champion in history at 36 years and 20 days. He has also won the
                          last three grand slam tournaments he has contested – he did not travel to the US Open last year due
                          to the United States banning unvaccinated visitors – compiling a 21‑match grand slam winning run.
                          Few people gave Ruud, the fourth seed, much of a realistic chance against the third seed Djokovic,
                          but after contesting the French and US Open finals last season against Nadal and Carlos Alcaraz,
                          Ruud knew what level it would take for him to match Djokovic in a grand slam final. Ruud started
                          the match vaporising his forehand as he took an early break, while Djokovic started the match
                          poorly. He played passively while he sprayed forehands and missed overheads. The benefit of being
                          Djokovic, though, is that he always has options. He dug in and he relied on his legs as he soaked
                          up a series of stinging Ruud forehands before retrieving the early break. Still, the Norwegian kept
                          his head up. The decisive moment of the match came while he led 5-4 with Djokovic serving.

                          Carlos Alcaraz defeated Casper Ruud in the final, 6–4, 2–6, 7–6(7–1), 6–3 to win the men's singles
                          tennis title at the 2022 US Open. It was his first major title, and he claimed the world No. 1
                          singles ranking with the win.[1] Ruud, Rafael Nadal, Daniil Medvedev, and Stefanos Tsitsipas were
                          also in contention for the top position.[2] Alcaraz saved a match point en route to the title, in
                          the quarterfinals against Jannik Sinner.[3] Alcaraz became the youngest major champion since Nadal
                          at the 2005 French Open, the youngest US Open champion since Pete Sampras in 1990, the first man
                          born in the 2000s to win a major singles title, and the youngest man to be ranked world No. 1 in
                          tennis history, surpassing the record Lleyton Hewitt held.[4] Alcaraz also became the third player
                          to reach a major final having won three consecutive five-set matches, after Stefan Edberg at the
                          1992 US Open and Andre Agassi at the 2005 US Open.[5] At 23 hours and 39 minutes of play duration
                          across his seven matches, Alcaraz spent the longest time on court in major history.

                          It came while he was trailing 4-3 in the first set; he raced forward to a short ball that bounced
                          twice before Ruud's racket touched it. Play continued, and Alcaraz hesitated then flubbed his
                          response. But Ruud told the chair umpire what had happened, giving the point to Alcaraz, who gave
                          his foe a thumbs-up and applauded right along with the spectators to acknowledge the move. Alcaraz
                          certainly seems to be a rare talent, possessing an enviable all-court game, a blend of groundstroke
                          power with a willingness to push forward and close points with his volleying ability. He won 34 of
                          45 points when he went to the net Sunday. He is a threat while serving — he delivered 14 aces at up
                          to 128 mph on Sunday -- and returning, earning 11 break points, converting three. Make no mistake:
                          Ruud is no slouch, either. There's a reason he is the youngest man since Nadal to get to two major
                          finals in one season and managed to win a 55-shot point, the longest of the tournament, in the
                          semifinals Friday. But this was Alcaraz's time to shine, his turn to show off the speed and
                          stamina, the skill and sangfroid, of a champion.

                          While the emergence and growth of Web3-focused projects are notable, it’s also important to point
                          out that current market conditions have been challenging for other key players. Peter Wall, CEO of
                          Argo Blockchain — a cryptocurrency mining company — told Cointelegraph that many Bitcoin miners
                          raised equity in 2021, but this has become difficult for some, given the bear market. “There are
                          only two ways for miners to raise capital now, which is either through debt or by selling Bitcoin,”
                          he said. Although this may be, Wall elaborated that only miners with a reputable track record will
                          receive loans. “They need to be able to execute with clear plans, while not being over committed to
                          machine purchases and bills they can’t pay.” Regulations were also heavily discussed at the
                          conference. This shouldn’t come as a surprise, as a number of key regulatory events took place
                          leading up to the event. For example, the bipartisan crypto bill, also known as the “Responsible
                          Financial Innovation Act,” was introduced in the United States Senate on June 7, 2022. According to
                          a statement, the bipartisan bill sponsored by senators Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming and Kirsten
                          Gillibrand of New York, “addresses CFTC and SEC jurisdiction, stablecoin regulation, banking, tax

Question 70              : When did the 148th Kentucky Derby take place?

                          The 2022 Kentucky Derby (officially, the 148th Running of the Kentucky Derby Presented by Woodford
                          Reserve[1]) took place on Saturday, May 7, 2022, at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky. It was
                          the 148th running of the Kentucky Derby, a 1+1⁄4 miles (2.0 km) Grade I stakes race for
                          three-year-old Thoroughbreds. The Derby is held annually at Churchill Downs on the first Saturday
                          in May since its inception in 1875. The 20 horses that ran in the Derby qualified by earning points
                          in the 2022 Road to the Kentucky Derby. The two favorites for the 2022 Kentucky Derby were
                          Epicenter, the winner of the Louisiana Derby, and Zandon, the winner of the Blue Grass Stakes. Both
                          horses finished behind winner Rich Strike, who had only entered the race after a late scratch.
                          Entering the race at odds of 80–1, Rich Strike's victory was the second-largest upset in Derby
                          history. It was the first Kentucky Derby victory for his trainer Eric Reed, as well as the first
                          graded stakes win in any race for his jockey Sonny Leon. Participation in the Kentucky Derby is
                          restricted to three-year-old Thoroughbreds.

                          The 148th running of the Kentucky Derby will take place Saturday at Churchill Downs in Louisville,
                          Kentucky. Zandon, leaving from the 10 post, opened as the 3-1 morning-line favorite after Derby
                          post positions were released Monday, followed closely by Epicenter at 7-2 from the third position.
                          Post time for Saturday's one and one-quarter mile race is 6:57 p.m. ET. In last year's edition of
                          the Run for the Roses, Medina Spirit crossed the finish line first, which appeared to have given
                          trainer Bob Baffert a record seventh win in the race and jockey John Velazquez his fourth Derby
                          win. However, the horse tested positive for a banned race-day substance and the Kentucky Horse
                          Racing Commission stripped Medina Spirit of his Derby title in February. With Medina Spirit's win
                          vacated, second-place finisher Mandaloun improved to first place. Here are the morning-line odds
                          for the 2022 Kentucky Derby, in order of post position (with trainer and jockey): Trainer: Todd
                          Pletcher Jockey: Irad Ortiz Jr. Trainer: Doug O'Neill Jockey: Rafael Bejarano Trainer: Steve

Question 71              : What was Tesla's revenue in Q1 2022?
Correct Answers         :  
                          18.76 billion
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prediction (only positive):
  - Answer              : $17.8 billion
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          Today after the bell American electric vehicle giant Tesla reported its first-quarter performance.
                          The company detailed revenues of $18.76 billion and $2.86 worth of earnings per share, up from its
                          Q1 2021 results of top line worth $10.389 billion and earnings per share of 93 cents. Tesla said it
                          faced several challenges in the first quarter related to global supply chain, transportation, labor
                          and manufacturing issues and that the problems could limit its ability to run its factories at full
                          capacity. The automaker also warned of continued supply constraints that could hamper future
                          production, despite the recent openings of its Gigafactories in Berlin and Texas that will build
                          the Model Y. “Our own factories have been running below capacity for several quarters as supply
                          chain became the main limiting factor, which is likely to continue through the rest of 2022,” the
                          automaker said in its financial outlook. Tesla reported $3.32 billion worth of net income, a 658%
                          increase from the $438 million reported for the same period last year. The company’s profit result
                          stands out as it is by far the company’s largest in recent history, towering around $1 billion
                          above its Q4 2021 net income results. The figures bested analysts expectations in both revenue and
                          net income terms. Per data from Yahoo Finance, analysts expected that Tesla would generate Q1 2022
                          revenues of $17.8 billion, and $2.26 in earnings per share.

                          The initial months of 2021 were not favorable for automakers. Semiconductor shortages derailed the
                          post-COVID recovery, affecting vehicle sales worldwide. But the shortages have eased a bit one year
                          later and auto sales are reviving. Automakers expect to recover the losses made during the last two
                          years, soon. However, traditional automakers are unable to cope with the rising demand for pure
                          EVs, whereas Tesla’s ability to address this demand has rewarded it not only with higher vehicle
                          sales in Q1 2022 but also a record revenue of $18.8 billion. Tesla has also started deliveries to
                          car rental service provider Hertz against its huge 100,000-vehicle order, which is also a reason
                          for high vehicle production and delivery during the quarter. Tesla’s Q1 2022 revenue would have
                          been more without the fresh COVID wave that has hit Shanghai and surrounding areas, affecting the
                          company’s production there. From the second week of March, rising cases of a new COVID variant have
                          forced automakers operating around Shanghai to suspend production. The urge to achieve L4 autonomy
                          by the end of 2023 and to roll out robotaxis by early 2025 can be a major reason for Tesla’s big
                          R&D spend. Besides, Tesla could also be conducting research on developing new battery chemistry.
                          The soaring prices of some key battery components like nickel and lithium have put the auto OEMs in
                          a spot.

                          STX Entertainment is an American entertainment and media company. Founded in March 2014 by film
                          producer Robert Simonds, the studio produces film, television, and digital media projects. In April
                          2020, STX announced that it would merge with the Indian studio Eros International plc. The merger
                          was completed in July 2020, and STX became a division of ErosSTX. In December 2021, Jahm Najafi
                          announced his intention to acquire STX from the merged company for $173 million–a sale completed in
                          April 2022. Eros remains a minority, non-voting shareholder.[1] In 2012, Simonds and McGlashan
                          began work on conceptualizing a media company based on the idea of producing medium-budget projects
                          with a star attached, a method that had gone out of style with Hollywood studios. The conversation
                          led to the launch of STX Entertainment in 2014, with the mission to finance, develop, produce,
                          market, and distribute star-driven content around the world.[2][3] Investors in the company
                          included Hony Capital, Tencent, PCCW, TPG Growth, and Liberty Global. Individual investors include
                          Gigi Pritzker, Beau Wrigley, and Dominic Ng.[4][5][6] In September 2017, it was reported that STX
                          was considering an initial public offering on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (SEHK).

                          majority on the Supreme Court for years. In a 42-year tenure that began weeks before Jimmy Carter
                          became president in 1977 and ended as his last term drew to a close in early 2019, Mr. Hatch was
                          one of the Senate’s best-known leaders, as familiar to many Americans as anyone on Capitol Hill. He

                          Salt Lake City, UT—The Hatch Foundation sadly announces the passing of Senator Orrin G. Hatch—the
                          Chairman Emeritus of the Hatch Foundation, former President Pro Tempore of the United States
                          Senate, and longest-serving Senator in Utah history (1977-2019). Senator Hatch passed away at 5:30
                          p.m. on Saturday, April 23, 2022 in Salt Lake City, Utah, surrounded by family. Upon the Senator’s
                          passing, the Hatch Foundation issued the following statements: “Senator Orrin G. Hatch personified
                          the American Dream,” said Matt Sandgren, Executive Director of the Hatch Foundation. “Born the son
                          of a carpenter and plaster lather, he overcame the poverty of his youth to become a United States

                          mission to expand freedom and opportunity for others—and the results speak for themselves. From tax
                          and trade to religious liberty and healthcare, few legislators have had a greater impact on
                          American life than Orrin Hatch. He was a profoundly positive influence in the lives of those he
                          served, whether they were the constituents he helped over four decades of casework, the hundreds of
                          interns he sponsored in both Utah and DC, or the robust network of Hatch staffers who carry on his
                          legacy to this day. Senator Hatch touched the hearts of countless individuals, and I know I speak
                          for all of them when I say he will be dearly missed.

                          weigh in on CNN+. In several virtual conferences, he met with CNN+ head Andrew Morse, CNN+ general

                          his skepticism with the product's programming, according to people in the meeting. The discussion
                          centered around the viability of offering a product named after CNN without actually featuring a
                          live feed of the network's cable programming. Perrette told the CNN+ leadership to pause all
                          marketing spending and not to launch on Roku.

                          far-right candidate Marine Le Pen during Sunday’s runoff vote. Macron took 58.5% of Sunday’s vote,

                          first round on April 10. While the contest was a rematch of the 2017 French presidential runoff,

                          most notably, the war in Ukraine. And though Macron’s pitch to voters of a globalized, economically
                          liberal France at the head of a muscular European Union won out over Le Pen’s vision for a radical
                          shift inward, the 41.5% of people who voted for her put the French far right closer to the
                          presidency than ever before. Le Pen’s performance is the latest indication that the French public
                          is turning to extremist politicians to voice their dissatisfaction with the status quo. In the
                          first round, far-left and far-right candidates accounted for more than 57% of the ballots cast.

                          There’s a lot to unpack here, literally and figuratively, so let’s get into it. Now I have some
                          pretty strong opinions about this program, but I’m a little worried I’m being too reactionary, so I
                          asked Sam to come in and lay a little sage wisdom on me. Shahram: Sam, you’ve been at iFixit for a
                          while. To me all this seems designed to be intimidating. 79 lbs (36 kilos) of tools and a $1200
                          deposit. Is this really what Apple thinks it takes to replace the screen on an iPhone? Sam: This is
                          definitely not what you or I would need to do these repairs. This is Apple’s way to get repeatable
                          factory results. You can certainly do the repair without these tools, but this is literally what
                          Apple is using, so if you want to be ultra official, you can. The real win here is the release of
                          those repair manuals. Shahram: The manuals are a win? Maybe I’m just used to the way we lay out our
                          guides but their documents felt less streamlined. The warnings in particular seemed a bit over the
                          top. Sam: I think this is closer to what Apple’s lawyers think we need to do these repairs. Apple
                          hasn’t done anything new here. This is exactly what they tell their authorized service providers
                          and independent repairers.

                          Fashionistas, mark your calendars: The first Monday in May is quickly approaching. What makes this
                          Monday different from every other? Why, it's the most fashion-forward holiday of the year: the Met
                          Gala. You might be thinking, "But didn't they just have the Met Gala?" If so, you'd be correct. The
                          event was last held eight months ago in September -- when we saw Kim Kardashian's masked Balenciaga
                          look, Lil Nas X's three-part wardrobe transformation and Rihanna and A$AP Rocky's red-carpet debut
                          as a couple -- and the second part will take place on the traditional date. Want to make sure
                          you've got all the stylish details in order before the big night? E! News can help. Here's
                          everything you need to know about the 2022 Met Gala. The 2022 Met Gala will take place May 2. The
                          name of the event is a bit of a giveaway. The chic celebration will be held at New York's
                          Metropolitan Museum of Art, specifically in the American Wing period rooms that showcase American
                          architecture and furnishings spanning from the 17th to 20th centuries to give a glimpse into these
                          time periods. Part one was "In America: A Lexicon in Fashion" -- marking the Costume Institute's
                          75th anniversary and establishing a "modern vocabulary of fashion," according to the organization's
                          press release.

                          release.[19][20] Investor documents released in November 2021 reported that the initial 2022
                          release window was delayed to at least 2023, intended for "giving the teams some extra time to
                          complete production and continue growing their creative resources to support the titles after
                          launch".[21] Kaplan anticipated that Overwatch and Overwatch 2 will ultimately merge into a single
                          product to avoid having any engine differences affecting player experience.

                          Tour de France route was revealed at the official Tour de France presentation on 27th October. The
                          race starts across the border in the Basque Country, the first time the race has started there
                          since 1992. A handful of hilly stages open the action before the race crosses the Pyrenees into
                          France. The route features only 22km of time trialling, all coming on the hilly stage 16. Four
                          summit finishes also feature, including the Puy de Dôme for the first time in 35 years and the
                          Grand Colombier in the Pyrenees. The mountainous course brings a tough final week, concluding with
                          a final showdown in the Vosges to Le Markstein on stage 20. 2022 champion Jonas Vingegaard
                          (Jumbo-Visma) will return to defend his title after dispatching two-time winner Tadej Pogačar (UAE
                          Team Emirates) last July.

                          The Tour now takes a day off to travel back to France, with van Aert leading the Tour’s General
                          Classification by 7 seconds over Belgium’s Yves Lampaert (Quick-Step Alpha Vinyl) and 14 seconds
                          over Slovenia’s Tadej Pogačar (UAE Team Emirates). The next three stages suit the Belgian’s
                          talents, so there’s a good chance that he’ll hold the Tour’s yellow jersey for a few more days.
                          Who’s really winning the Tour? A relatively peaceful stage was interrupted by a large crash with
                          about 10km to-go, emphasizing how important it is to stay as close to the front as possible at the
                          end of these early stages. Luckily, most of the Tour’s GC contenders managed to avoid losing time,
                          with the exception of Colombia’s Rigoberto Uran (EF Education-EasyPost), who was held up by a crash
                          for the second day in row and this time was unable to rejoin the leaders. The 35-year-old lost 39
                          seconds by the finish, a tough blow to his chances of scoring a high finish in Paris. Who’s Winning
                          the Tour? Belgium’s Wout van Aert (Jumbo-Visma) is the new overall leader of the 2022 Tour de
                          France.

  - Source              :
                          Although the race came back together before the finish, what was maybe most notable was that
                          Vingegaard was part of the small first group over the climb, while teammate and co-leader Primož
                          Roglič wasn’t. Maybe Roglič (correctly) bet the race would come back together and it wasn’t a wise
                          use of strength. But after he seemed slightly less fit on climbs than Vingegaard at June’s
                          Criterium du Dauphiné, the fact that he wasn’t present at a crucial moment will do little to settle
                          the debate about which rider is the team’s best shot at yellow. Elsewhere, Ineos was clearly the
                          most watchful of the GC teams, with Yates, Geraint Thomas, and Dani Martinez attentive at the
                          front. There’s a lot of race left in the Tour but we may look back on today’s events as a predictor
                          of what was to come. Who’s Winning the Tour? Belgium’s Wout van Aert (Jumbo-Visma) remained the new
                          overall leader of the 2022 Tour de France after finishing second on Stage 3 in Sønderborg. The
                          27-year-old actually extended his lead by earning a 6-second time bonus on the finish line. The
                          Netherland’s Dylan Groenewegen (Team BikeExchange-Jayco) won the stage, his first Tour stage win
                          since 2019.

                          Open The second of seven US Open Series tournaments, the Atlanta Open is an ATP 250 tennis
                          tournament held annually at the end of July. For 2023, the tournament’s prize money is $737,170,
                          which translates to €666,453 and £575,184, a 4% bump over 2022. Formerly the BB&T Atlanta Open, the
                          tournament dates back to 1921, having first lived in Indianapolis before moving to Atlanta.
                          However, under current ownership, the event has run since 2010. American tennis player John Isner
                          has been particularly successful at the event. Since 2010, he’s made his way to nine finals and won
                          six, including 2021, so we’ll see if he can claim it again in 2023. This year marks the
                          tournament’s highest prize money, with the winner taking home $112,125 and the runner-up landing a
                          $65,405 check, a 4% increase for both over 2021. In doubles, players don’t see as much prize money,
                          but the winning pair will claim $38,960, while the runner-up will earn $20,850. Like singles,
                          that’s a 4% increase compared to last year for both.

Correct Answers         :

  - Source              :
                          Year-over-year quarterly net sales grew 33% from $14.8 billion in Q2 2021 to $19.7 billion in 2022.
                          Operating income from AWS increased 36% year-over-year from $4.2 billion in Q2 2021 to $5.7 billion
                          this year. During the 2022 second quarter, AWS announced new customer agreements with Delta
                          Airlines and British Telecom, among other enterprises. In the earnings call, Amazon staff stated
                          that over half of capital investment for the entire 2022 year would focus on technology
                          infrastructure for AWS. In the call, Amazon staff projected Q3 2022 net sales to range from $125
                          billion to $130 billion, an increase of 13% to 17% over Q3 2021. Operating income will range from

                          impact on foreign exchange rates. I reported last week on Shopify’s poor second-quarter
                          performance, and I’ve been following Wall Street analysts’ responses to the two companies. While
                          both suffered losses, analysts had a much more bullish response to Amazon. The market agreed, with
                          Amazon’s stock price rising 12% in after-hours trading the day the company announced its results.
                          Shopify’s stock price tumbled amidst analyst criticism, although it has since recovered. Amazon has

                          Amazon’s financial results for the quarter ended June 30 were affected by the slowdown in online
                          consumer purchasing, like many other ecommerce retailers and platforms. The company acknowledged

                          go check it out! The story itself is new, and it “ties together the futures of the worlds depicted
                          in Xenoblade Chronicles and Xenoblade Chronicles 2.” There are two warring factions in the world of

                          story". In countless yet seamless ways, Peele completely deconstructs any ideas the media have
                          presented us about aliens in the past. Nope is an original, atypical alien film that uses the mode
                          of otherworldly forces to explore the idea of the spectacle and “the good and the bad that come
                          from this idea of attention.” The first notion of the spectacle that Peele introduces in Nope is
                          the discussion surrounding the first moving picture ever created by Eadweard Muybridge in the 19th
                          century. This is mentioned because the black jockey that was riding the horse in those photographs
                          has been seen by all but goes unnamed throughout history, while the white photographer lives in
                          infamy. The even more personal connection to this is that the jockey was the great-great-great
                          grandfather of Nope’s two protagonists, siblings OJ Haywood (Daniel Kaluuya) and Emerald Haywood
                          (Keke Palmer). This concept of the spectacle quickly grows larger than life as it takes a variety
                          of forms throughout Nope that all revolve around exploitation.

                          Meta Open-Sources 175B Parameter Chatbot BlenderBot 3 Aug 30, 2022 2 min read by Anthony Alford
                          Meta AI Research open-sourced BlenderBot 3, a 175B parameter chatbot that can learn from live
                          interactions with users "in the wild." In evaluations by human judges, BlenderBot 3 achieves a 31%
                          rating increase compared to the previous BlenderBot version. The chatbot was described in a post on
                          the Meta AI blog. BlenderBot 3 is based on the OPT-175B pre-trained language model. The bot can
                          also access data from Internet searches and conversational long-term memory, reducing its
                          propensity to "hallucinate" and improving the coherence of conversations. To help gather more
                          training data, Meta has set up an interactive demo site, where users in the United States can chat
                          with the bot; to prevent malicious users from engaging in toxic conversation, Meta has implemented
                          several technologies for detecting offensive language and trolling. According to the Meta team: We
                          are committed to sharing organic conversational data collected from the interactive demo system as
                          well as model snapshots in the future. We hope this work will help the wider AI community spur
                          progress in building ever-improving intelligent AI systems that can interact with people in safe
                          and helpful ways.

                          Facebook’s parent company has created a bot capable of weighing in on almost any topic – from
                          radicalisation to sending Mark Zuckerberg to jail Last week, researchers at Facebook’s parent
                          company Meta released BlenderBot 3, a “publicly available chatbot that improves its skills and
                          safety over time”. The chatbot is built on top of Meta’s OPT-175B language model, effectively the
                          company’s white-label version of the more famous GPT-3 AI. Like most state-of-the-art AIs these
                          days, that was trained on a vast corpus of text scraped from the internet in questionable ways, and
                          poured into a datacentre with thousands of expensive chips that turned the text into something
                          approaching coherence. But where OPT-175B is a general-purpose textbot, able to do anything from
                          write fiction and answer questions to generate spam emails, BlenderBot 3 is a narrower project: it
                          can have a conversation with you. That focus allows it to bring in other expertise, though, and one
                          of Meta’s most significant successes is hooking the language model up to the broader internet. In
                          other words: “BlenderBot 3 is capable of searching the internet to chat about virtually any topic.”
                          On top of that, BlenderBot is designed to improve itself through feedback on earlier conversations,
                          whereas large language models like OPT-175B are generally fairly static.

                          GPT3 and OPT-175B are working language models, intended to be used – among other things – for
                          serious commercial enterprises. BlenderBot 3, though, is a bit of a laugh. Hence those open
                          questions about safety. Within a few days of BlenderBot being online and ready to mingle (with
                          Americans only, alas), users were posting some spicy examples of the chatbot’s output. The Wall
                          Street Journal’s Jeff Horwitz found that the bot appeared to have been radicalised by Facebook into
                          supporting Donald Trump as a three-term president: And into bringing antisemitic conspiracy
                          theories up, unprompted: Renee DiResta of the Stanford Internet Observatory found that the bot
                          would claim to be an a supporter of the German paramilitary organisation the Red Army Faction:
                          Pranav Dixit of BuzzFeed News found the bot wants to send Zuckerberg to jail: The whole thing is
                          most reminiscent of Tay, Microsoft’s AI-based learning chatbot, which was released in 2016 and
                          promptly became a Hitler-loving Trump supporter: ‘Tay is designed to engage and entertain people
                          where they connect with each other online through casual and playful conversation,’ Microsoft said.
                          ‘The more you chat with Tay the smarter she gets.’ But it appeared on Thursday that Tay’s
                          conversation extended to racist, inflammatory and political statements.

                          ChatGPT Plus (a premium version of ChatGPT), and with access to the GPT-4 based version of OpenAI's
                          API being provided via a waitlist.[1] As a transformer based model, GPT-4 was pretrained to predict
                          the next token (using both public data and "data licensed from third-party providers"), and was
                          then fine-tuned with reinforcement learning from human and AI feedback for human alignment and

                          What we know about the new GPT-4 model Last Updated on April 20, 2023 OpenAI’s CEO has already
                          confirmed a new model that is set to replace GPT-3.5. Surprise surprise, it will be called GPT-4!
                          We are happy to announce that the wait is finally over! OpenAI officially launched this new model
                          on its website this week. And there’s no doubt about it – it is definitely something to get excited
                          about. So, since GPT-4 has arrived, what features will it have and how do you access it? Let’s have
                          a look at what GPT-4 can do. The first major feature we need to cover is its multimodal
                          capabilities. According to OpenAI, GPT-4 will be able to accept “image and text inputs, emitting
                          text outputs”. This new feature was also confirmed by Microsoft’s Germany CTO last week. But, what
                          is a multimodal model? Well, this refers to a model that can operate using multiple mediums such as
                          text, image, and sound. This technology could open up a wide range of opportunities for its users
                          and will completely revolutionize the way we interact with OpenAI-powered tools. So, what else can
                          we expect? Well, according to the developers, GPT-4 may be more similar to GPT-3.5 than we think.

                          Home Smart Home Brands Amazon If a stranger knocked on your door and asked to take a video of your
                          home’s floor plan and contents, you’d shut the door in their face, right? But what if that stranger
                          added that you’d never have to clean your floors again? Would it change your mind? For millions of
                          Roomba users, the answer is “yes.” Somewhere between the flip phone and the iPhone, the convenience
                          of a portable pocket computer began to outweigh the privacy intrusion of being tracked everywhere
                          we go. Now it’s hard to find someone who doesn’t own a smartphone. Tech behemoth Amazon figured out
                          early on that convincing people to trade privacy for convenience was a smart bet. Their latest move
                          is another example of that bet paying off. Amazon and iRobot, the maker of Roomba, announced last
                          week that Amazon offered to acquire iRobot. Does Amazon simply see an opening in the robot cleaning
                          space? Their personal robot, Astro, has been slow to take off, even with the catchy name from The
                          Jetsons. Or is there more to the deal? On This Page First, the facts: Amazon wants to buy the
                          recently-struggling robot-vacuum company for $1.7 billion. It’s an all-cash deal, with Amazon
                          offering $61 a share to iRobot shareholders. Shareholders must agree to the deal, and the Federal
                          Trade Commission (FTC) needs to sign off as well.

                          Noting that iRobot has been running its robotics platform on Amazon's cloud service unit AWS for
                          many years, Su said the acquisition could lead to more integration of Amazon speech recognition and
                          other capabilities into vacuums. In midday trading, iRobot shares rose 19%. Amazon's were down
                          1.4%. The deal comes as anti-monopoly advocates continue to raise concerns about Amazon's
                          increasing dominance. The purchase of iRobot is Amazon's fourth-largest acquisition, led by its
                          $13.7 billion deal to buy Whole Foods in 2017. Last month, the company said it would buy the
                          primary care provider One Medical in a deal valued roughly at $3.9 billion, a move that expanded
                          its reach further into health care. On Friday, groups advocating for stricter antitrust regulations
                          called on regulators to block the iRobot merger, arguing it gives Amazon more access into
                          consumers' lives and furthers its dominance in the smart home market. "The last thing American and
                          the world needs is Amazon vacuuming up even more of our personal information," said Robert
                          Weissman, president of the progressive consumer rights advocacy group Public Citizen. "This is not
                          just about Amazon selling another device in its marketplace," Weissman said. "It's about the
                          company gaining still more intimate details of our lives to gain unfair market advantage and sell
                          us more stuff.

                          If regulators or shareholders don’t approve the acquisition, Amazon must pay a $94 million
                          termination fee to iRobot, according to iRobot’s SEC filing. The parties have one year from the
                          Aug. 4 filing date to complete the deal, with extensions possible. Roombas have been generating
                          maps of people’s homes since 2015, when the 980 model first used a camera and mapping software to
                          “learn” where obstacles like couches and end tables were. That’s a lot of maps. And if the deal
                          goes through, Amazon will be sitting on this huge trove of info about iRobot’s customers. What will
                          they do with it? Things become clearer when you recall what iRobot CEO Colin Angle told Reuters
                          five years ago: “There’s an entire ecosystem of things and services that the smart home can deliver
                          once you have a rich map of the home that the user has allowed to be shared.” If that sounds to you
                          like the whole idea is to sell you things, you’re not alone. Privacy advocates are wary. “People
                          tend to think of Amazon as an online seller company, but really Amazon is a surveillance company,”

Question 97              : What is the location of the Major League Baseball Field of Dreams Game 2022?

                          Dyersville, Iowa

                          3] In November 2020, MLB announced the 2021 game date and that the contest would feature the
                          originally planned participants, the White Sox and Yankees.[4] The game is hosted in Dyersville,
                          Iowa, near the filming location of the titular 1989 baseball movie. The field constructed for the
                          movie, which has been operated as a tourist destination since 1989, could not be brought to MLB
                          game standards without permanently altering major features of the property and destroying its movie
                          authenticity, so it was decided to build a separate playing facility at a distance of approximately
                          500 ft (150 m) in the cornfields. The new field is in the property of the Ameskamp family, who used
                          to own the left and center field of the 1988 Field of Dreams (the rest was owned by the Lansing
                          family) before selling it to the Lansing family in 2007. The design of the ballpark pays homage to
                          the White Sox' home from 1910 to 1990, Comiskey Park, including the shape of the outfield and the
                          bullpens beyond the center field fence. Windows were included in the design of the right field wall
                          to show the cornfields beyond the ballpark and to provide views of the movie set.[5][1] Following
                          postponement of the originally scheduled game, the field remained fallow during the 2020 season.

                          Windows 11 22H2 will release on September 20, 2022, and here are all the details you need to know.
                          Windows 11 version 22H2 (2022 Update) is the next major refresh of the Microsoft desktop operating
                          system. Codenamed “Sun Valley 2,” the feature update will continue updating the desktop interface,
                          bringing back previously removed features, and introducing new features and improvements. Although
                          we are still days away from the release date, Microsoft is done adding the new features and changes
                          for the Windows 11 2022 Update. The intended final version of the update is already available in
                          the Release Preview Channel of the Windows Insider Program. This release will include new features
                          like Live Captions and Voice Access. It will also introduce an updated version of File Explorer
                          that brings support for tabs and a redesigned navigation pane, a new way to snap applications on
                          the screen with drag and drop Snap layouts flyout, and redesigned version of Task Manager.
                          Furthermore, you will find many visual updates for legacy elements and more. The final version of
                          Windows 11 22H2 has been available since June 7, 2022, but only as a preview in the Release Preview
                          Channel. The feature update is expected to launch on Tuesday, September 20, 2022 (the update is now
                          live for everyone). The update will be offered as a free upgrade for computers already running the
                          original version.

                          Windows 11 is a major release of the Windows NT developed by Microsoft that was released in October
                          2021. Starting with Windows 10, Microsoft described Windows as an "operating system as a service"
                          that would receive ongoing updates to its features and functionality, augmented with the ability
                          for enterprise environments to receive non-critical updates at a slower pace or use long-term
                          support milestones that will only receive critical updates, such as security patches, over their
                          five-year lifespan of mainstream support. Windows Insider Preview builds are delivered to Insiders
                          in four different channels. Insiders in the Dev and Canary Channel receive updates prior to those
                          in the Beta Channel, but might experience more bugs and other issues. Insiders in the Release
                          Preview Channel do not receive updates until the version is almost available to the public, but are
                          comparatively more stable. As with Windows 10 (since version 20H2), mainstream builds of Windows 11
                          are labeled "YYHX", with YY representing the two-digit year and X representing the half-year of
                          planned release (for example, version 21H2 refers to builds which initially released in the second
                          half of 2021). The original version of Windows 11 (also known as version 21H2 and codenamed "Sun
                          Valley") was released in October 2021.[1][2] It carries the build number 10.0.22000.

Question 99              : When did AMD unveil Ryzen 7000 processors?

                          In a brief press release sent out this morning, AMD has announced that they will be delivering
                          their eagerly anticipated Ryzen 7000 unveiling later this month as a live stream. In an event
                          dubbed “together we advance_PCs”, AMD will be discussing the forthcoming Ryzen 7000 series
                          processors as well as the underlying Zen 4 architecture and associated AM5 platform – laying the
                          groundwork ahead of AMD’s planned fall launch for the Ryzen 7000 platform. The event is set to kick
                          off on August 29th at 7pm ET (23:00 UTC), with CEO Dr. Lisa Su and CTO Mark Papermaster slated to
                          present. AMD first unveiled their Ryzen 7000 platform and branding back at Computex 2022, offering
                          quite a few high-level details on the forthcoming consumer processor platform while stating it
                          would be launching in the fall. The new CPU family will feature up to 16 Zen 4 cores using TSMC's
                          optimized 5 nm manufacturing process for the Core Complex Die (CCD), and TSMC’s 6nm process for the
                          I/O Die (IOD). AMD has not disclosed a great deal about the Zen 4 architecture itself, though their
                          Computex presentation has indicated we should expect a several percent increase in IPC, along with
                          a further several percent increase in peak clockspeeds, allowing for a 15%+ increase in
                          single-threaded performance.

                          CPUs in the Ryzen 7000 line at CES 2023, most notably the Ryzen 7040, the first (and so far only)
                          laptop CPU in the lineup -- and the first AMD laptop CPU to ship with onboard Ryzen AI tech. The
                          AMD Ryzen 7000 desktop processors have arrived. AMD announced the pricing and availability of its
                          upcoming Zen 4 architecture-based CPUs during the company's “Together we advance PCs” live stream
                          in August 2022. As previously revealed during Computex 2022, the new chips will feature TSMC's
                          5-nanometer process and run on AMD's new AM5 platform. AMD released four Ryzen 7000 series CPUs on
                          September 27, 2022. As it did with the previous Ryzen 5000 chips, the company plans to release the
                          higher-end (i.e. more expensive) CPUs first and then follow up with more budget processors later
                          this year. Prices for the initial crop of CPUs ranges from $299 to $699. Here's everything you need
                          to know about the new AMD Ryzen 7000 processors. AMD’s Ryzen 7000 series processors will launch on
                          September 27, 2022. The line will consist of four CPUs.

                          The first four standard desktop PC chips are now available at retail, but the company will also
                          launch at least one 3D V-Cache model by the end of the year. Intel has its Raptor Lake processors
                          poised on the starting blocks, ensuring that AMD's Ryzen 7000 will have stiff competition when it
                          arrives on October 20. We've gathered all of the information we know into this article. The first
                          four Zen 4 Ryzen 7000 processors arrived on September 27, 2022, accompanied by the high-end X670
                          and X670E chipsets, while the B650E and the B650 chipsets will arrive in October. New EXPO
                          (EXtended Profiles for Overclocking) DDR5 memory kits are also available, but PCIe 5.0 SSDs will
                          come to market in October. The Ryzen 7000 chips will mark just the first step of the Zen 4 journey
                          as the company delivers on its CPU roadmap and brings them to the desktop and notebook markets. AMD
                          will also use the Zen 4 architecture for its data center CPU roadmap. The Ryzen 7000 processors
                          come with the N5 TSMC 5nm process node for the core compute die (CCD) and use the TSMC 6nm process
                          for the I/O Die (IOD). We have a deeper breakdown of the architecture further below. The chips will
                          drop into Socket AM5 motherboards.

                          rough season combined with injuries led her to abruptly switch coaches—which is a decision not
                          normally made during an Olympic cycle. Now, a year later, that change has clearly paid off. The bad
                          news for the rest of the world is that the champion says she’s only at 75 percent, as she’s still
                          recovering from a recent concussion and is dealing with stress fractures in both shins. McClain
                          thinks she’ll be completely ready for the world championships later this year in England. “Anything
                          can happen,’’ she said. “So I’m excited for the future.’’ After the first day of competition,
                          McClain was a close second behind Jones, but a strong opening vault put her ahead of Jones, who
                          fell off the balance beam. Though the gold medalist stayed in front the rest of the night, things
                          ultimately came down to the final rotation.

Question 102              : What is the date of the premiere of House of the Dragon?

                          August 21, Aug 21, Aug. 21, 21 August, 21 Aug, 21 Aug.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - Answer              : Aug. 21

  - Source              :
                          House of the Dragon premieres Aug. 21 on HBO. It’s been three years since Game Of Thrones ended,
                          and five years since its fandom started complaining bitterly about its final seasons. Spin-off
                          House Of The Dragon therefore debuts to less hype than it might have once had, but really could
                          restore our fascination with Westeros. Immediately, its premiere boasts everything that Thrones did
                          well: an overqualified cast of character actors; backstabbing; sexposition; and lots of dragons.
                          The first proposed spin-off to Game Of Thrones – a Naomi Watts-led adventure set in Westeros’
                          distant past – was ultimately scrapped, reportedly because it was too different from the original
                          show. Perhaps as a result, it sometimes feels like there’s an element of overcorrection here. It’s
                          beautifully rendered - the budget is clearly late-season Game Of Thrones rather than Season 1, and
                          both the Cornish and Spanish locations and the computer-generated dragon flights look magical - but
                          looks and sounds awfully close to its progenitor, down to iconography and locations. That’s not
                          necessarily a bad thing when it comes to the storytelling, since it’s set just far enough in
                          Westeros’ past to keep us guessing, but it speaks of a pervasive timidity in Hollywood to take even
                          the most minor of risks. Still, that’s admittedly more a criticism of this show’s context than its
                          content. Showrunners Ryan J.

                          cost-cutting measures, killing off 40 or so shows and shelving “Batgirl,” leaving many subscribers
                          worried about what content will be left when the company merges the streaming services HBO Max and
                          Discovery+ next year. Most recently, HBO Max took down 200 “Sesame Street” episodes (not cool,
                          David). The newly merged company also laid off 70 employees from HBO and HBO Max. HBO Max and its

                          Here's a rundown of the PSVR 2 specs below: Sony revealed the PlayStation VR2 headset design and a
                          final design image for the PlayStation VR2 Sense controller on 22nd February, 2022. Senior Vice
                          President of Platform Experience, Hideaki Nishino said the 'circular orb shape represents the
                          360-degree view that players feel when they enter the virtual reality world'. Nishino said the
                          design was also inspired by the PS5 family of products, including its black and white aesthetic and
                          rounded edges of the DualSense Wireless controller and the Pulse 3D Wireless headset. While its
                          also not too dissimilar to its predecessor's design, Sony has confirmed a new vent design promises
                          better airflow and avoids having the lens fog up during game sessions. The PS VR2 also offers
                          improved comfort thanks to a slimmer, lighter design and an adjustable lens so you can optimize
                          your view. What's your thoughts? Will you be upgrading to the new PSVR 2? While we wait for more

                          The edge they possess stems from the self-imposed discipline of their recruitment operation, and
                          the sheer depth of data they have generated to shape transfer policy and in-game approach — an
                          attempt to make life in a volatile environment as risk-free as is feasible. “We decide how we work
                          and we won’t deviate from that just because an agent calls pushing a player to us, or if people
                          think we should do things differently,” says Julien Demeaux, the club’s head of data who was one of
                          the first appointments made by Toulouse following RedBird’s takeover in the summer of 2020. “There
                          is a real discipline to our approach, and the ownership likes that. It all starts from the top.”
                          Demeaux is sitting in the boardroom flanked by Brendan MacFarlane, the club’s head of recruitment,
                          and the senior scout Julia Arpizou. The latter, a former player in the youth and reserve teams at
                          Toulouse, Bordeaux and Lyon, where she shared a dressing room with Megan Rapinoe, is the only one
                          of the trio to have played football at a high level. Demeaux’s background is actually in

                          that a film is in current production or will ever go into production.[10] In 2021, it was revealed

                          Beasts-series") and Jamie Dornan ("Fifty Shades of Grey", "Once Upon a Time", "Marie Antoinette")
                          auditioned for the film.[11] In February of 2022, Take Two and 2K announced that the film was back
                          in development and would be a Netflix exclusive film.[12] In August of 2022, it was announced that
                          Francis Lawrence would be helming the film as director, and Michael Green would be writing the
                          script.

                          New Amsterdam is an American medical drama television series, based on the book Twelve Patients:
                          Life and Death at Bellevue Hospital by Eric Manheimer, that premiered on September 25, 2018 on NBC
                          and concluded on January 17, 2023, with 89 episodes over five seasons. The series was created by
                          David Schulner and stars Ryan Eggold, Freema Agyeman, Janet Montgomery, Jocko Sims, Anupam Kher,
                          Tyler Labine and Sandra Mae Frank. New Amsterdam follows Dr. Max Goodwin as he becomes the medical
                          director of one of the United States' oldest public hospitals, aiming to reform the neglected
                          facility by tearing up its bureaucracy to provide exceptional care to patients. This episode opens
                          with a message from actors Ryan Eggold and Daniel Dae Kim, explaining that "Matter of Seconds"
                          replaced the scheduled episode "Pandemic," because its events were too similar to the actual
                          COVID-19 pandemic. Scenes featuring Kim's character Dr. Cassian Shin from "Pandemic" were shown to
                          introduce viewers to the character ahead of his appearance in this episode. On September 25, 2017,
                          NBC announced that it had given the production, then titled Bellevue, a put pilot commitment. The
                          pilot was written by David Schulner, who was also set to executive produce alongside Peter Horton.
                          Eric Manheimer, the former medical director at New York City's Bellevue Hospital, was expected to
                          serve as a producer.

  - Source              :
                          Menu A native Tennessean, Emmy Award winning meteorologist Henry Rothenberg loves being able to
                          call Nashville and NewsChannel 5 home, and work alongside the talented members of the Storm 5
                          Weather Team. Born and raised in Memphis, Henry is no stranger to the ever-changing weather of the
                          Mid-South having experienced everything from Ice Storm 94 to the Super Tuesday tornado outbreak in
                          February 2008. Believe it or not, Henry was terrified of thunderstorms until he was seven years
                          old. That's when his cousin took him outside during a storm (highly advise against that now) and
                          explained to him what was causing all of the scary noise. It was from that point that his fear
                          became a fascination and now a career! While a junior in high school in Memphis, Henry began
                          shadowing the weather team at CBS affiliate WREG-TV. He mainly spent his time shadowing Todd Demers
                          on the morning newscast. He arrived at the station at 4:30 a.m. when his school schedule would
                          allow and spent as much time at WREG as time allowed. Henry credits this experience with jump
                          starting his career. Henry attended the University of Missouri where he was a member of the Mizzou
                          Storm Chase Team, chasing storms all across the plain states. Henry's desire to chase storms when
                          most are trying to avoid them is fueled by his passion for weather, and desire to keep people safe
                          in dangerous weather.

Question 115              : How much money did Texas Tech pay Marlene Stollings in the settlement?

  - Source              :
                          That same month, Texas Tech paid $740,000 to settle a breach-of-contract lawsuit filed by former
                          women’s basketball coach Marlene Stollings, who was fired in 2020 following a joint investigation
                          by The Intercollegiate and USA Today. The reporting uncovered, through public records requests, a
                          trove of athlete exit interview surveys in the school’s possession, with claims of abuse made
                          against Stollings by at least a dozen athletes over two years. Nevertheless, Texas Tech didn’t so
                          much as suspended the coach until firing her the day after the story was published, though TTU had
                          initiated an internal investigation several months before. In her lawsuit filed against the school
                          and Hocutt, Stollings accused her former boss of terminating her to “deflect blame” after realizing
                          that his “own position was at risk.” While denying the merit of Stollings’ “inflammatory”
                          allegations, Hocutt and the university filed motions to dismiss on account of Texas’ qualified
                          immunity law, which shields public officials from liability “when they are acting within their
                          discretionary authority and their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or
                          constitutional law.” It’s the same regulation that allowed Texas Tech to ward off an employment
                          lawsuit filed by former football coach Mike Leach.

                          7 million in donations for 2021-22, up from $15.9 million the previous academic year. Donna
                          Lopiano, a former longtime senior athletics administrator at Texas, said that university leaders
                          like Hocutt should only get so many chances to show they can maintain a “safe educational
                          environment.” “I can see an athletic director facing a situation, recognizing they don’t have a
                          strong enough policy in place, then getting a policy in place, reading the riot act (to coaches),”
                          Lopiano said. “That is the one shot I think that most employees have.” Marty Greenberg, an adjunct
                          law professor at Marquette and longtime sports lawyer, argues that Texas Tech should now be under
                          scrutiny for not only how it handles the employment Adams, but his direct superior. Given Hocutt’s
                          popularity among boosters and alumni, and its financial fruits, Greenberg says the safe bet is the
                          athletic director survives, even if another one of his hires does not. “I am predicting the money
                          and success of the program will win out,” Greenberg said. Then again, this week has already offered
                          a precedent. On Monday, the Des Moines Register reported that a $4 million settlement had been
                          reached between the University of Iowa and a group of black Hawkeyes football players who accused
                          head coach Kirk Ferentz of racial discrimination.

                          Sony and Tencent acquired a 30 percent stake of FromSoftware, the esteemed Japanese video game
                          studio behind “Elden Ring” and the Dark Souls series, Wednesday. Kadokawa Corporation, the

                          GoldDerby For the past 11 years since its debut in 2011, “The Voice” has been a mainstay of NBC’s
                          spring schedule, typically kicking off in February or March and running through May. That wasn’t
                          the case for 2022. For the first time in the reality TV show’s history, “The Voice” skipped the
                          spring season as it refocuses on becoming more of an event series that only airs one cycle each
                          fall. What does this mean going forward? Read on for everything to know about “The Voice” Season
                          22, including the coaches, premiere date and battle advisors. Why didn’t “The Voice” air in the
                          spring? Network executive Frances Berwick revealed to Deadline in May 2021, “We want to eventize
                          this iconic series. We think ‘The Voice’ will be on NBC for a very long time to come and we believe
                          the best way to protect the brand, while also super serving fans, is to produce one amazing cycle
                          this year.” Most other reality TV shows already follow this once-per-year format, including
                          “American Idol” on ABC, which airs every spring and will thus no longer face direct competition
                          from “The Voice.” “The Voice” coaches On May 15, NBC announced that new coach Camila Cabello would
                          be replacing Kelly Clarkson on the judges’ panel for Season 22, as Clarkson takes some time for
                          herself.

                          GoldDerby For the past 11 years since its debut in 2011, “The Voice” has been a mainstay of NBC’s
                          spring schedule, typically kicking off in February or March and running through May. That wasn’t
                          the case for 2022. For the first time in the reality TV show’s history, “The Voice” skipped the
                          spring season as it refocuses on becoming more of an event series that only airs one cycle each
                          fall. What does this mean going forward? Read on for everything to know about “The Voice” Season
                          22, including the coaches, premiere date and battle advisors. Why didn’t “The Voice” air in the
                          spring? Network executive Frances Berwick revealed to Deadline in May 2021, “We want to eventize
                          this iconic series. We think ‘The Voice’ will be on NBC for a very long time to come and we believe
                          the best way to protect the brand, while also super serving fans, is to produce one amazing cycle
                          this year.” Most other reality TV shows already follow this once-per-year format, including
                          “American Idol” on ABC, which airs every spring and will thus no longer face direct competition
                          from “The Voice.” “The Voice” coaches On May 15, NBC announced that new coach Camila Cabello would
                          be replacing Kelly Clarkson on the judges’ panel for Season 22, as Clarkson takes some time for
                          herself.

                          named the new head football coach at Virginia Tech, the Hokies announced Tuesday. Pry, 51, replaces
                          former Hokies coach Justin Fuente, who was out as Hokies coach as of Nov. 16 after his teams went
                          43-31 in six seasons. Pry returns to Blacksburg, where he served as a defensive graduate assistant

                          graduate assistant in the 1990s, I was privileged to have been a part of this program as the Hokies
                          established themselves as a national power, consistently proving they could beat anyone in the
                          nation. "Even after I departed Blacksburg, I always continued to appreciate Virginia Tech, its

                          facilities, university backing of Athletics, and phenomenal fan support that Virginia Tech enjoys
                          made this a very desirable situation.

                          named the new head football coach at Virginia Tech, the Hokies announced Tuesday. Pry, 51, replaces
                          former Hokies coach Justin Fuente, who was out as Hokies coach as of Nov. 16 after his teams went
                          43-31 in six seasons. Pry returns to Blacksburg, where he served as a defensive graduate assistant
                          for the Hokies from 1995 to 1997 under head coach Frank Beamer and defensive coordinator Bud
                          Foster. "On behalf of Amy and our family, we are extremely grateful to President [Timothy] Sands
                          and [athletic director] Whit [Babcock] for extending us this opportunity at Virginia Tech," Pry
                          said in a statement released by the school. "Working for Coach Beamer and Coach Foster as a
                          graduate assistant in the 1990s, I was privileged to have been a part of this program as the Hokies
                          established themselves as a national power, consistently proving they could beat anyone in the
                          nation. "Even after I departed Blacksburg, I always continued to appreciate Virginia Tech, its
                          great players, its championship teams, and its wonderful traditions from afar. The resources,
                          facilities, university backing of Athletics, and phenomenal fan support that Virginia Tech enjoys
                          made this a very desirable situation.

                          Nebraska fired Sunday, Joseph is a former Husker quarterback. “After the disappointing start to our

                          Black head coach at Nebraska in any sport and among four new members of the staff this season.
                          “Trev has made a good choice in asking Associate Coach Mickey Joseph to step in as interim head
                          coach for the rest of the year and we eagerly look forward to his leadership,” said UNL Chancellor

                          championship in 2019.

                          Robert L. "Mickey" Joseph[1] (born March 5, 1968) is a former American football coach and player.
                          He served as the interim head coach at the University of Nebraska in 2022. Joseph was the associate
                          head coach and wide receivers coach at Louisiana State University (LSU) from 2017 to 2021, and was
                          also head football coach at Langston University in Langston, Oklahoma, from 2011 to 2012. Joseph
                          attended the University of Nebraska–Lincoln, where he played quarterback for the Nebraska
                          Cornhuskers. The native of Marrero, Louisiana, who attended Archbishop Shaw High School started off
                          his career as a capable backup playing behind starters Steve Taylor and Gerry Gdowski for his
                          freshman and sophomore years. He took over the team as the starter in a two-quarterback system with
                          teammate Mike Grant during Joseph's junior year in 1990. As a starter at Nebraska, he led his team
                          to a 9–2 regular season record in his only season as the team's starting signal caller under the
                          direction of head coach Tom Osborne. That season, Joseph got Nebraska off to a perfect 8–0 record
                          as expectations in Lincoln, Nebraska, were building up off a No. 3 ranking from the AP Poll. The
                          next game came on November 3, 1990, as Nebraska faced nationally ranked No. 1 Colorado.

                          Carousel of Time (Amazon mp3/iTunes) Track Listing: Jackie Evancho has been in the music business
                          for a very long time. Ever since being the runner-up to America’s Got Talent way back in 2011, it’s
                          been her ability at such a young age, to fuse together classily and powerfully, opera and pop into
                          a hybrid genre of operatic pop (a musical genre that someone like Josh Groban would be more
                          familiar and akin to). While Jackie herself isn’t necessarily as popular nowadays compared to when
                          she did wow us on our television screens all those years ago, what Jackie has nevertheless created
                          over the last decade or so, is a musical genre and style that is as underappreciated as it is
                          undervalued, to say the least. Jackie’s music is indeed something that is unique- so different and
                          compelling that we as a site decided to write about her music, impact, and influence– highlighting
                          her original songs, her cover tracks, alongside songs she’s covered not in English as well. On the
                          whole, Jackie’s music has touched millions of people around the world, mine inclusive, as well.

                          Netflix's League of Legends-based animated series Arcane has won an Emmy for Outstanding Animated
                          Program, becoming the first streaming series to win in that category. It beat out some much better
                          known competition, including Bob's Burgers, Rick and Morty, The Simpsons and What If...? hosted by
                          the late Chadwick Boseman. "It’s a big deal for us as we come from video games. It’s been amazing
                          to see the world embrace our characters and our stories," said Arcane co-creator Christian Linke.
                          The series stars Ella Purnell (Jinx), Hailee Steinfeld (Vi) and Katie Leung (Caitlyn). It was
                          picked up for a second season by Netflix last winter, suggesting that the streamer was willing to
                          embrace high-budget game-based productions. The first season boasted nearly 34.2 million viewing
                          hours in its first week on Netflix's top 10 chart, putting it second in views at that time. It also
                          received very positive reviews from both critics and audiences.

                          total wins. This year, “The Simpsons” was nominated for two Emmys: Outstanding Animated Program and
                          Outstanding Character Voice-Over Performance, the latter of which it lost to another Fox comedy,
                          “Family Guy.” (Seth MacFarlane took home his fifth Emmy in 23 nominations.) Other nominees for Best

                          Me,” the series finale of “Adventure Time.” Many expected the Netflix series “BoJack Horseman” to
                          win its first Emmy in the category (and first Emmy ever).

                          In just over 24 hours, Qatar 2022 will burst into life as the host nation takes on Ecuador in the
                          opening game of the World Cup. It’s a tournament that has caused controversy ever since it was
                          awarded to the Gulf nation in 2010 but, after years of waiting, the players are making the final
                          touches to their preparations. While off-field issues continue to make headlines, from the deaths
                          of migrant workers and the conditions many have endured in Qatar, to LGBTQ and women’s rights, and
                          the fact no alcohol will be sold at stadiums, the on-field action promises to be unpredictable and
                          thrilling. Here is all you need to know about the 32 nations competing and the players who could
                          dazzle. Only eight nations have ever won the men’s World Cup, many of which are among the favorites
                          this time around. Brazil holds the records for most titles, having lifted the trophy five times,
                          and the new generation has a real chance of adding another for what would be the country’s first in
                          20 years. The attacking options speak for themselves. As he has done since stepping onto the world
                          stage, Neymar will carry the expectations of a nation but will have Real Madrid’s Vinicuis Jr. and
                          Barcelona’s Raphinha to support him.

                          Cup.[106] Since Qatar reached the final stage as winners in their group, Lebanon, the fifth-best
                          second place team, advanced instead.[107] France, the reigning World Cup champions also went

                          withdrew from it before their first match. North Korea withdrew from the AFC qualifying round due
                          to safety concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Both American Samoa and Samoa withdrew before
                          the OFC qualification draw.[109] Tonga withdrew after the 2022 Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha'apai eruption

                          In just over 24 hours, Qatar 2022 will burst into life as the host nation takes on Ecuador in the
                          opening game of the World Cup. It’s a tournament that has caused controversy ever since it was
                          awarded to the Gulf nation in 2010 but, after years of waiting, the players are making the final
                          touches to their preparations. While off-field issues continue to make headlines, from the deaths
                          of migrant workers and the conditions many have endured in Qatar, to LGBTQ and women’s rights, and
                          the fact no alcohol will be sold at stadiums, the on-field action promises to be unpredictable and
                          thrilling. Here is all you need to know about the 32 nations competing and the players who could
                          dazzle. Only eight nations have ever won the men’s World Cup, many of which are among the favorites
                          this time around. Brazil holds the records for most titles, having lifted the trophy five times,
                          and the new generation has a real chance of adding another for what would be the country’s first in
                          20 years. The attacking options speak for themselves. As he has done since stepping onto the world
                          stage, Neymar will carry the expectations of a nation but will have Real Madrid’s Vinicuis Jr. and
                          Barcelona’s Raphinha to support him.

                          sentencing date. Leonard Glenn Francis, also known as “Fat Leonard” for his overshadowing frame,
                          fled Sunday while under house arrest in San Diego, where he was awaiting a Sept. 22 hearing. A

                          upon arrival noticed the house was now vacant.” The Navy is working with the U.S. Marshals Service

                          Nearly a dozen U.S. law enforcement agencies were searching for Francis on Tuesday. But officials
                          acknowledged he may already be in Mexico, and possibly on his way back to Asia. Four years ago,
                          U.S. District Court Judge Janis Sammartino feared Francis might run off when she turned down his
                          lawyer’s request to allow him to be under house arrest without round-the-clock security guards
                          watching the ailing defense contractor. At the time, Francis was cooperating with prosecutors as
                          they pursued charges against dozens of Navy officials who accepted bribes in exchange for
                          classified information that gave Francis’ ship servicing business in Asia an edge in getting
                          military contracts. When asked about the bold escape Tuesday, his lawyer, Devin Burstein, who
                          pushed for more leniency for his client, said: “At this time, I have no comment, sorry.” Sammartino
                          repeatedly maintained that Francis, who was in poor health and needed medical care, could only
                          remain under house arrest if private security guards were on site. At one point she expressed
                          concern that if he were to escape and ended up “back in Malaysia for whatever reason,” her name
                          would come up if anyone asked “who let somebody do this without any security,” according to a
                          transcript of a closed-door hearing in February 2018 that was unsealed in January. She raised
                          similar concerns in another hearing on Dec.

                          CEO Mark Zuckerberg will lay out the company's latest updates on the metaverse at the virtual
                          event. Meta Connect, the tech giant's annual virtual reality conference, will take place on Oct. 11
                          this year, the company said on Tuesday. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the event in a Facebook
                          post, saying simply "See you at Meta Connect on Oct 11." The site for the virtual event teases that
                          people will be able to "discover how the metaverse is being built by many and why collaboration is
                          the key to it all." Meta said it'll also offer a look at progress the company has made as well as
                          at what's to come in the near and far future. At last year's event, Zuckerberg revealed his
                          company's new name, Meta, a nod to its focus on building the metaverse. "This is the next chapter
                          of our work, and, we believe, for the internet overall," Zuckerberg said at the time. Zuckerberg
                          also teased Project Cambria, the company's next virtual reality headset, which is expected to be
                          more advanced and more expensive. In August, Zuckerberg said that the headset would come out in
                          October and that more details would be revealed at Connect. The virtual event will be livestreamed
                          on the Reality Labs Facebook page at 7 a.m. ET / 10 a.m. PT on Oct. 11.

Question 132              : How much is the fine that Meta is facing for failing to safeguard children's information on Instagram?
Correct Answers         :

  - Source              :
                          The company says it will appeal the fine from Ireland's Data Protection Commission. Meta faces a
                          hefty GDPR fine for its handling of children's data. Meta is facing a fine of 405 million euros, or
                          just over $400 million, from Ireland's Data Protection Commission for failing to safeguard
                          children's information on Instagram. The country's data watchdog had accused Instagram of setting
                          children's accounts to "public" by default and allowing children to operate business accounts on
                          the platform, which could leave their phone numbers and email addresses exposed. Full details of
                          the decision are expected to be published next week, a commission spokesman said Tuesday. Meta
                          confirmed the fine and said it plans to appeal the decision. "This inquiry focused on old settings
                          that we updated over a year ago, and we've since released many new features to help keep teens safe
                          and their information private," a Meta spokesperson told CNET via email on Tuesday. "Anyone under
                          18 automatically has their account set to private when they join Instagram, so only people they
                          know can see what they post, and adults can't message teens who don't follow them." The
                          spokesperson added that Meta disagrees with how the fine was calculated and is reviewing the rest
                          of the commission's decision. The $400 million fine would be the second-largest issued to a tech
                          company for a violation of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, behind Amazon's
                          record-setting $888 million fine in 2021.

                          children. He said the ICO had several ongoing investigations. “I’ve been clear that our work to
                          better protect children online involves working with organisations but will also involve
                          enforcement action where necessary,” he said. “We are currently looking into how over 50 different
                          online services are conforming with the children’s code and have six ongoing investigations looking
                          into companies providing digital services who have not, in our initial view, taken their
                          responsibilities around child safety seriously enough.” The Instagram owner, Meta, was fined €405m
                          (£349m) by the Irish data watchdog this month for letting teenagers set up accounts that publicly
                          displayed their phone numbers and email addresses. In May, the ICO fined the facial recognition
                          company Clearview AI £7.5m – the third largest it has imposed – for collecting images of people
                          from social media platforms and the web to add to a global database. The ICO ordered the US-based
                          firm to delete the data of UK people from its systems. The company has collected more than 20bn
                          images of people’s faces from Facebook, other social media companies and from scouring the web.

                          Gotham Knights is a 2022 action role-playing game developed by WB Games Montréal and published by
                          Warner Bros. Games. Inspired by the Batman: Gotham Knights comic series and based on the DC Comics
                          character Batman and his supporting cast, the game focuses on the characters Nightwing, Batgirl,
                          Robin, and Red Hood as they attempt to restore justice to Gotham City during a period of decline in
                          the immediate aftermath of Batman's death. While investigating the events that led to their
                          mentor's demise, the heroes become embroiled in an ancient conflict between two secret
                          organizations fighting for control of Gotham: the Court of Owls and the League of Shadows. Gameplay
                          is presented from the third-person perspective with a primary focus on using each playable
                          character's traversal and combat abilities to defeat enemies and explore the environment. Players
                          can freely move around Gotham City, interacting with characters, undertaking missions, and gaining
                          experience points and other resources to level up their characters and equipment. Outside of the
                          story, players are able to complete side missions to unlock additional content and collectible
                          items. A cooperative online multiplayer mode is also included, allowing two players to play through
                          the single-player campaign together while progressing in their own game. Gotham Knights was
                          released on October 21, 2022, for PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series X/S. Versions for the
                          PlayStation 4 and Xbox One were also planned, but were ultimately cancelled.

                          release date is finally arriving this week, and everyone can soon play through the latest foray
                          into Gotham City. Without Batman or Commissioner Gordon to protect the city following their deaths,
                          the task is instead left up to the Bat-Family of Nightwing, Batgirl, Robin, and the Red Hood. In
                          your way stands the mysterious secret society the Court of Owls. It's a decent game, too. In our
                          three-star Gotham Knights review, we called it "a mixed bag" but noted that, "once you stop
                          comparing it to Arkham in your head", you should find plenty to enjoy. Enough of our babbling,
                          here's everything you need to know about Gotham Knights from its release date and trailers to how
                          to pre-order it for yourself. Plus, is it on Game Pass? The Gotham Knights release date will take
                          place on 21st October 2022, the developers have confirmed. You can buy your copy from the likes of
                          Amazon. The game has already seen a number of different release dates come and go, but it looks
                          like the delays are over and this one will stick! For console players, the Gotham Knights launch
                          time in the UK is midnight BST, just as the clock ticks over to 21st October. PC players,
                          meanwhile, have to wait until 5pm on 21st October to play the co-op game on either Steam or the
                          Epic Games Store.

  - Source              :
                          During his later years, Shaw enjoyed tending the gardens at Shaw's Corner. He died at the age of
                          ninety-four of renal failure precipitated by injuries incurred when falling while pruning a
                          tree.[212] He was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium on 6 November 1950. His ashes, mixed with
                          those of Charlotte, were scattered along footpaths and around the statue of Saint Joan in their
                          garden.[213][214] Shaw published a collected edition of his plays in 1934, comprising forty-two
                          works.[215] He wrote a further twelve in the remaining sixteen years of his life, mostly one-act
                          pieces. Including eight earlier plays that he chose to omit from his published works, the total is
                          sixty-two.[n 25] 1890s Full-length plays Adaptation Short play Shaw's first three full-length plays
                          dealt with social issues. He later grouped them as "Plays Unpleasant".[216] Widowers' Houses (1892)
                          concerns the landlords of slum properties, and introduces the first of Shaw's New Women—a recurring
                          feature of later plays.[217] The Philanderer (1893) develops the theme of the New Woman, draws on
                          Ibsen, and has elements of Shaw's personal relationships, the character of Julia being based on
                          Jenny Patterson.

                          During his later years, Shaw enjoyed tending the gardens at Shaw's Corner. He died at the age of
                          ninety-four of renal failure precipitated by injuries incurred when falling while pruning a
                          tree.[212] He was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium on 6 November 1950. His ashes, mixed with
                          those of Charlotte, were scattered along footpaths and around the statue of Saint Joan in their
                          garden.[213][214] Shaw published a collected edition of his plays in 1934, comprising forty-two
                          works.[215] He wrote a further twelve in the remaining sixteen years of his life, mostly one-act
                          pieces. Including eight earlier plays that he chose to omit from his published works, the total is
                          sixty-two.[n 25] 1890s Full-length plays Adaptation Short play Shaw's first three full-length plays
                          dealt with social issues. He later grouped them as "Plays Unpleasant".[216] Widowers' Houses (1892)
                          concerns the landlords of slum properties, and introduces the first of Shaw's New Women—a recurring
                          feature of later plays.[217] The Philanderer (1893) develops the theme of the New Woman, draws on
                          Ibsen, and has elements of Shaw's personal relationships, the character of Julia being based on
                          Jenny Patterson.

                          On 8 September 2022, at 15:10 BST, Elizabeth II, Queen of the United Kingdom and the other
                          Commonwealth realms, and the longest-reigning British monarch, died at Balmoral Castle in
                          Aberdeenshire, Scotland, at the age of 96. Her death was publicly announced at 18:30. She was
                          succeeded by her eldest son, Charles III. The death of Queen Elizabeth II set in motion Operation
                          London Bridge, a collection of plans including arrangements for her state funeral, and supported by
                          Operation Unicorn, which set protocols for her death occurring in Scotland. The United Kingdom
                          observed a national mourning period of 10 days. The Queen's lying in state took place in
                          Westminster Hall from 14 to 19 September, during which time an estimated 250,000 people queued to
                          pay their respects. Elizabeth's state funeral on 19 September was the first held in Britain since
                          Winston Churchill's in 1965. A funeral service was held at Westminster Abbey, followed by a
                          procession to Wellington Arch that featured around 3,000 military personnel and was watched by
                          around a million people in central London. The state hearse then transported the Queen's coffin to
                          Windsor, followed by another procession through Windsor Great Park and a committal service at St
                          George's Chapel at Windsor Castle.

                          "left a huge void".[220] Due to the COVID-19 restrictions in place in England at the time,
                          Elizabeth sat alone at Philip's funeral service, which evoked sympathy from people around the world.

                          King Charles III and his wife, Queen Camilla, were both formally crowned Saturday in a historic
                          ceremony at London's Westminster Abbey before appearing on the balcony for a flyover. The
                          coronation ceremony, steeped in centuries of tradition but with a few small tweaks for the modern
                          age, played out in front of about 2,000 invited guests and a global audience of millions watching
                          on TV or livestream. Though Charles officially became king following the death of his mother, Queen
                          Elizabeth II, on Sept. 8, 2022, today's coronation ceremony consecrated and celebrated his ascent
                          to the throne. Follow along below for the latest updates as the ceremony unfolded: King Charles and
                          Queen Camilla stepped out onto the balcony of Buckingham Palace Saturday with other senior members
                          of their family to watch a military fly-past and greet members of the public. They were joined by
                          other "working" members of the royal family, including William and Kate, the Prince and Princess of
                          Wales, and their children. As part of the "slimmed down" coronation day events requested by the
                          king, not all members of their large family joined them.

Question 139              : What is Trace Adkins' role in "Monarch"?
Correct Answers         :  
                          Albie Roman

  - Source              :
                          The upcoming Fox series boasts strong ties to the real Nashville, including cameos by a host of
                          country stars and a theme song by Music City songwriting royalty Trace Adkins says he truly met his
                          match when he was offered the role of Albie Roman, the patriarch in Monarch, the much-anticipated
                          Fox primetime drama set in the country music scene. "He's very much like me," the 60-year-old
                          country hitmaker tells PEOPLE. "I mean, I can look back over periods in my life where the train was
                          perpetually off the track, and that's Albie's world. The train is perpetually off the track.
                          Sometimes it's his fault, sometimes it's not, but he has to deal with that stuff." Indeed, Adkins
                          has had his share of tabloid headlines over the years — but forgive him for forgetting one more
                          glaringly obvious reason that the part fits him to a T: The singer and his character are both
                          big-time country stars. And obviously, Adkins' casting is just one of the ways the show, which is
                          set in Austin, is sure to bring a country music authenticity to what promises to be one of the
                          fall's hottest — and steamiest — new shows.

                          Adkins also said he didn't "really lean on anybody" for advice when it came to prepping for the
                          role, even though his friends Blake Shelton and Tim McGraw have years of TV experience. Blake has
                          been on "The Voice" for years, and Tim recently starred in the "Yellowstone" prequel, "1883."
                          "Blake’s thing is a completely different animal," he said. "You can’t compare that stuff." He said
                          he hadn't talked to McGraw, but added: "Tim’s a good actor, I’ve always respected what he does.
                          I’ve just kind of done my own thing, haven’t had to really lean on anybody too much for a lot of
                          advice." Adkins, who isn't a stranger to acting, with previous stints on television and in the
                          recent movies "Old Henry," "Apache Junction" and "Badland," said playing Albie, his character on
                          "Monarch," wasn't too big of a stretch. "He's a no-nonsense kind of guy, and I’m kind of that way
                          too," Adkins admitted. "He’s not very animated, and neither am I. We say what we’ve gotta say, and
                          don’t have to yell it … just kind of move through this life as softly and peacefully as they’ll
                          allow us to, but when they don’t – we'll do what we’ve gotta do.

                          7-inch display — the same size as the iPhone 14 Pro Max — for $200 less (check out our iPhone 14
                          Plus vs iPhone 14 Pro Max showdown). You also get the same great cameras in the regular iPhone 14,
                          a slightly upgraded A15 Bionic processor for better graphics and a slick new Action mode video
                          along with very impressive battery life. So what do you give up? Quite a bit actually, including
                          features that competing Android phones offer for around the same price, such as an always-on
                          display, fast refresh rate and telephoto zoom. These are all features the iPhone 14 Pro series
                          offer, too. Now that I’ve been using the iPhone 14 Plus, I’d say that it’s one of the best iPhones.
                          But there are some minuses here for sure. Let’s break down the pros and cons in my iPhone 14 Plus
                          review. The iPhone 14 Plus just got a new Yellow color option. Check it out here. The iPhone 14
                          Plus has a release date of October 7. The base price for the iPhone 14 Plus is $899 (£949 /
                          AU$1,579), which gets you 128GB storage. That's $100 more than the 6.1-inch iPhone 14. But it's
                          also $100 less than the Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus. The 256GB version of the iPhone 14 Plus costs $999
                          (£1,059.

                          True crime podcasts have swiftly gone from a fringe hobby to a booming business, spurring not only
                          a slew of shows, much merch, and a hit TV comedy series, but also a lot of questions about the
                          ethics of civilians poking their noses into real-life tragedies. Everyone wants to be a hero. But
                          what lengths might one go to get there? This is the winsome yet disturbing journey at the center of
                          Susie Searches. Kiersey Clemons stars as Susie Wallis, a socially awkward college student with a
                          mind for solving mysteries. Naturally, she has her own true crime podcast called Susie Searches, so
                          when fellow student/meditation influencer Jesse (Alex Wolff) goes missing, her interest in cracking
                          the case isn't exactly selfless. If she finds the internet-adored victim, she and her podcast could
                          score the validation she desperately craves. Whether she's squeezing the sheriff (Jim Gaffigan) for
                          clues, eying a convenient creep (Ken Marino) as a suspect, or scouting out evidence, Susie is on a
                          mission to save the day…and promote herself. Forget the hardscrabble detectives of film noir; Susie
                          has more in common with Oliver Putnam than she does Sam Spade. Rather than a gun and a trench coat,
                          she carries a big smile smacked with colorful braces and a disarming demeanor that tends to make
                          people underestimate her. She seems childish for a college student and ridiculous as an
                          investigator. But!

                          The problem begins with Clemons. A film like Susie Searches demands a star turn, high voltage,
                          explosively quirky nerdery and histrionics. Think Flick, Nicole Kidman in To Die For, or either
                          lead in Agnieszka Smoczynska’s recent The Silent Twins. Clemons is mute, blank, inexpressive,
                          bored, taciturn, seeming even resentful of being there. Wolff clearly dislikes the type of zoomer
                          he’s portraying, delivering a good deal of his lines with embarrassed insecurity. The film is not a
                          failure in toto, but its failure to launch can only be credited to Kargman. The edit is the film’s
                          most disastrous component, frequently cutting away from critical reactions and lingering too long
                          on silence, stillness, and useless moments of transition. Kargman knew what type of movie she
                          wanted to make, and she more or less made one. All the parts are there, yet the intrepid detective
                          still struggles to understand how they connect. Little White Lies is committed to championing great

                          True crime podcasts have swiftly gone from a fringe hobby to a booming business, spurring not only
                          a slew of shows, much merch, and a hit TV comedy series, but also a lot of questions about the
                          ethics of civilians poking their noses into real-life tragedies. Everyone wants to be a hero. But
                          what lengths might one go to get there? This is the winsome yet disturbing journey at the center of
                          Susie Searches. Kiersey Clemons stars as Susie Wallis, a socially awkward college student with a
                          mind for solving mysteries. Naturally, she has her own true crime podcast called Susie Searches, so
                          when fellow student/meditation influencer Jesse (Alex Wolff) goes missing, her interest in cracking
                          the case isn't exactly selfless. If she finds the internet-adored victim, she and her podcast could
                          score the validation she desperately craves. Whether she's squeezing the sheriff (Jim Gaffigan) for
                          clues, eying a convenient creep (Ken Marino) as a suspect, or scouting out evidence, Susie is on a
                          mission to save the day…and promote herself. Forget the hardscrabble detectives of film noir; Susie
                          has more in common with Oliver Putnam than she does Sam Spade. Rather than a gun and a trench coat,
                          she carries a big smile smacked with colorful braces and a disarming demeanor that tends to make
                          people underestimate her. She seems childish for a college student and ridiculous as an
                          investigator. But!

                          Busch will leave Joe Gibbs Racing at the end of the 2022 season and join Richard Childress Racing
                          beginning in 2023, according to a report by Jordan Bianchi of The Athletic. An official
                          announcement of Busch's move to RCR is expected to come Tuesday. The two-time NASCAR Cup Series
                          champion will leave Joe Gibbs Racing after a 15-year tenure that saw Busch become one of the
                          greatest drivers of his generation as well as one of the greatest in NASCAR history, earning 56 of
                          his 60 career victories behind the wheel of a Gibbs Toyota. Busch's departure comes after a
                          protracted contract situation that could not be resolved, as Joe Gibbs Racing was unable to find a
                          sponsor capable of replacing the departing Mars Inc. and meeting Busch's salary demands. Busch is
                          expected to be replaced behind the wheel of the No. 18 Toyota by Ty Gibbs, the 19-year old grandson
                          of Joe Gibbs and a star in the NASCAR Xfinity Series. It is uncertain whether Busch will drive a
                          third car for Richard Childress Racing or replace Tyler Reddick behind the wheel of the No. 8
                          Chevrolet.

                          His career average finish is 13.8, and no full-time RCR driver has reached that mark since Ryan
                          Newman in 2015. And on top of driving for RCR, his deal is also leading him to swap manufacturers
                          for Kyle Busch Motorsports in the Craftsman Truck Series. His team will be branded by Chevrolet in
                          2023, a major overhaul with Chase Purdy and Jack Wood joining the team. Fortunately for Busch, he
                          will not have to worry about finding sponsors at RCR. 3CHI, Alsco, BetMGM, Cheddars and Lenovo have
                          all confirmed they will sponsor the No. 8 car. And if anyone can bring back a championship trophy
                          to RCR, it will be Busch.

                          apples to apples like other years.” Under the normal points system, Djokovic might not even qualify
                          for the ATP Finals in Turin, Italy, this year. Heading into Paris, he was in 10th place in the
                          points race. But under the ATP’s Grand Slam champion rule, any player who wins a major title and is
                          ranked within the top 20 is guaranteed a spot in the year-end championship. (The WTA Tour has no
                          such rule, which is why Djokovic’s fellow Wimbledon champion, Elena Rybakina, did not qualify for
                          the WTA Finals in Fort Worth.) “Most of the upheaval this year is because of Djokovic,” Patrick
                          McEnroe, a former United States Davis Cup captain and now an ESPN commentator said. “He missed two
                          majors and didn’t get points for the one he won. It really affected the rest of the field. You
                          could make the case that if Djokovic runs the table, wins Paris and the ATP Finals, that he
                          deserves to be No. 1.” The player most likely to end 2022 at No. 1 is Alcaraz. So far he has won
                          five tournaments this year, including ATP Masters 1000s in Miami and Madrid. In Madrid, he beat
                          Nadal, Djokovic and Alexander Zverev in succession.

                          an unexpected turn of events. Titans season 4 spoilers follow. Titans has delivered a hugely
                          shocking twist in its season 4 premiere. No sooner had Lex Luthor (Titus Welliver) entered the fray
                          did he exit in dramatic fashion, being surprisingly killed off while meeting with son Conner Kent
                          (Joshua Orpin). In the newly-released premiere, the supervillain suddenly started to spit up blood
                          before dying, and showrunner Greg Walker has admitted that even he is "disappointed" by the
                          all-too-brief appearance. Related: The Originals star supervillain look revealed in Titans season 4

                          they were only allowed limited use of Luthor by DC. Walker added that bigger characters tend "to
                          gobble up a lot of Titans stories". "Not that they would have given us more than one episode [of
                          Lex], but we also wanted to focus on the Titans," he continued. “And as you will see, this season
                          really focuses on the Titans and their relationships with each other.

                          saying, “I’m so smart. I don’t have time to pick up my clothing.” It was something that vexxed him.
                          So I said, I think Lex is the same. I think he has multiple black suits that he wears, multiple
                          black shirts and ties. That’s his thing. He doesn’t think about that. When he gets up, takes a
                          shower does his thing and goes in, and there’s no thought about it. But I wanted him to be really
                          kind of streamlined. I wanted him to look not like he’s slovenly, of “I’ve got 10 pairs of khakis
                          and a white shirt.” I’m simple, but I’m pressed because, for him, it’s also all about presentation.
                          I said, when this guy enters a room, he doesn’t move for anybody. So it was important to have that
                          silhouette. I thought also a lot about — and I spoke with the producers about this — parallels to
                          the character of Colonel Walter Kurtz who Marlon Brando plays in Apocalypse Now. I kept saying,
                          hey, when there are opportunities, maybe let’s not reveal Luthor physically right away.

                          did he exit in dramatic fashion, being surprisingly killed off while meeting with son Conner Kent
                          (Joshua Orpin). In the newly-released premiere, the supervillain suddenly started to spit up blood
                          before dying, and showrunner Greg Walker has admitted that even he is "disappointed" by the

  - Source              :
                          This article was published more than 5 years ago For nearly seven decades, a South Asian man had
                          never won an Emmy in an acting category. That changed Sunday night with Riz Ahmed, a British actor
                          of Pakistani descent, winning an Emmy award for outstanding lead actor in a limited series or movie
                          for his role in HBO’s “The Night Of.” Before him, only one other South Asian star had taken home an
                          acting award from the ceremony — Archie Panjabi, who won an Emmy for her role in “The Good Wife” in
                          2010. Ahmed’s win was seen as a long-overdue victory for South Asians and his fellow Muslims. His
                          success is significant not only because of his historic win, but because of the character he
                          portrayed: Naz, a nuanced, relatable college student from Queens — who also happens to be
                          Pakistani. While “The Night Of” tackles issues of race and Islamophobia, Naz’s ethnicity and
                          religion are secondary to the story’s main plot. “It’s always strange reaping the rewards of a
                          story that’s based on real world suffering,” Ahmed, who is also an activist and rapper, said in his
                          acceptance speech. “But if this show has shown a light on some of the prejudice in our society,
                          Islamophobia, some of the injustice in our justice system, then maybe that’s something.

Question 148              : How much did Google acquire Mandiant for?
Correct Answers         :  
                          5.4 billion
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - Source              :
                          Google has announced that its proposed $5.4 billion bid to buy cybersecurity firm Mandiant is now
                          complete. The internet giant revealed plans to acquire publicly traded Mandiant back in March, less
                          than a year after Mandiant was spun out of its previous owner FireEye as part of a $1.2 billion
                          deal with private equity firm Symphony Technology Group. Moving forward, Mandiant will operate
                          under the auspices of Google Cloud, though the Mandiant brand will live on. “We will retain the
                          Mandiant brand and continue Mandiant’s mission to make every organization secure from cyber threats
                          and confident in their readiness,” Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian wrote in a blog post. Mandiant

                          so-called “big three” public cloud providers alongside Amazon and Microsoft, Google’s big promise
                          to would-be customers is that it will keep all their data and infrastructure secure. This means
                          continually introducing new products to address the ever-changing threat landscape, thought it
                          sometimes means acquiring long-established incumbents with the expertise to bolster Google’s
                          security proposition. And that’s effectively what Google’s getting with Mandiant, giving it a major
                          boost in terms of security data gathering capabilities, not to mention access to hundreds of
                          security personnel.

                          Mandiant will join Google's cloud computing division, which is yet to grow to the same size as
                          Microsoft Azure or Amazon Web Services. "Organizations around the world are facing unprecedented
                          cybersecurity challenges as the sophistication and severity of attacks that were previously used to
                          target major governments are now being used to target companies in every industry," said Thomas
                          Kurian, CEO of Google Cloud, in a statement. He added: "We look forward to welcoming Mandiant to
                          Google Cloud to further enhance our security operations suite and advisory services, and help
                          customers address their most important security challenges." The deal is expected to close later
                          this year. Shares of Mandiant closed up 16% on Monday after The Information reported that Google
                          was interested in acquiring the company. Mandiant, which has a market value around $5.25 billion,
                          was previously under the FireEye umbrella before that brand was sold. FireEye was credited with
                          helping Microsoft discover the SolarWinds hack that attacked government systems in 2019 and 2020.
                          Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to investors Tuesday, "With cyber attacks increasing by the

                          Google has announced that its proposed $5.4 billion bid to buy cybersecurity firm Mandiant is now
                          complete. The internet giant revealed plans to acquire publicly traded Mandiant back in March, less
                          than a year after Mandiant was spun out of its previous owner FireEye as part of a $1.2 billion
                          deal with private equity firm Symphony Technology Group. Moving forward, Mandiant will operate
                          under the auspices of Google Cloud, though the Mandiant brand will live on. “We will retain the
                          Mandiant brand and continue Mandiant’s mission to make every organization secure from cyber threats
                          and confident in their readiness,” Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian wrote in a blog post. Mandiant

                          so-called “big three” public cloud providers alongside Amazon and Microsoft, Google’s big promise
                          to would-be customers is that it will keep all their data and infrastructure secure. This means
                          continually introducing new products to address the ever-changing threat landscape, thought it
                          sometimes means acquiring long-established incumbents with the expertise to bolster Google’s
                          security proposition. And that’s effectively what Google’s getting with Mandiant, giving it a major
                          boost in terms of security data gathering capabilities, not to mention access to hundreds of
                          security personnel.

                          The annual inflation rate for the United States was 3.0% for the 12 months ended June, according to
                          U.S. Labor Department data published on July 12, 2023. This follows a rise of 4.0% in the previous
                          period. The next update on inflation is scheduled for release on Aug. 10 at 8:30 a.m. ET. It will
                          provide information on the rate of inflation for the 12 months ended July 2023. Below is a chart

                          the December column. For instance, the inflation rate in 2022 was 6.5%. Meanwhile, the "Ave" column
                          shows the average inflation rate for each year using CPI data. In 2022, the average inflation rate
                          was 8.0%. These average rates are published by the BLS but are rarely discussed in the news media,

                          Kingdom is out now worldwide exclusively for the Nintendo Switch and, unsurprisingly, it's one of
                          the biggest and most exciting games available on the platform. Tears of the Kingdom is the sequel
                          to Breath of the Wild, which is widely considered to be one of the best Switch games ever and was
                          the console's biggest launch title. In other words, Tears of the Kingdom had some big shoes to
                          fill, and it ended up being even better! In our full near-perfect The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the
                          Kingdom review we said it: "leaps forward on what was offered in 2017’s Breath of the Wild, filling

                          Unsurprisingly for a first-party Nintendo game, it's exclusive to the Nintendo Switch console
                          family. Tears of the Kingdom was initially due to release in 2022 but, in March of that year,
                          Nintendo pushed the date into 2023, with series producer, Eiji Aonuma, telling fans it was out of a
                          desire to "extend out development time a bit". The game is now available worldwide physically and
                          digitally.

                          Nintendo has guarded the new Breath of the Wild game so tightly that players do not even know the

                          about the Zelda game come and go, the newest rumor might hold more water than the others. While the
                          alleged title is still a rumor, the next adventure of Link and Zelda is “The Legend of Zelda:
                          Breath of Duality.” According to Nintendo Life, the report comes from veteran video game journalist
                          Paul Gale “who runs his own website, appeared in Nintendo Power, and worked with many other video
                          game outlets over the years,” according to Nintendo Life. In a post, Gale reports that “the sequel
                          to BotW and its main hook is right in the name, which establishes on the ‘Breath’ familiarity from
                          the 2017 hit and [gives] a nod to the fact that you can play as more than the aforementioned
                          title’s Link (including various, polar themes), hence ‘Duality.’” RUMOR: A potential Breath of the

                          works. The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is out now The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the
                          Kingdom is out now worldwide exclusively for the Nintendo Switch and, unsurprisingly, it's one of
                          the biggest and most exciting games available on the platform. Tears of the Kingdom is the sequel
                          to Breath of the Wild, which is widely considered to be one of the best Switch games ever and was
                          the console's biggest launch title. In other words, Tears of the Kingdom had some big shoes to
                          fill, and it ended up being even better! In our full near-perfect The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the
                          Kingdom review we said it: "leaps forward on what was offered in 2017’s Breath of the Wild, filling
                          out the world’s sandbox with innovative new tools and abilities, letting you approach challenges in
                          inventive new ways" The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom launched on May 12, 2023.
                          Unsurprisingly for a first-party Nintendo game, it's exclusive to the Nintendo Switch console
                          family. Tears of the Kingdom was initially due to release in 2022 but, in March of that year,
                          Nintendo pushed the date into 2023, with series producer, Eiji Aonuma, telling fans it was out of a
                          desire to "extend out development time a bit". The game is now available worldwide physically and
                          digitally.

                          By Ash Parrish, a reporter who has covered the business, culture, and communities of video games
                          for seven years. Previously, she worked at Kotaku. Tears of the Kingdom is only a scant 44 days
                          away. To celebrate the game’s impending arrival, Nintendo dropped a 13-minute mini Direct featuring
                          gameplay and a sneak peek at Link’s new abilities. Tears of the Kingdom, formerly known as The
                          Sequel to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, was originally slated for a 2022 release. (It’s
                          now coming out on May 12th.) Eiji Aonuma, the game’s producer, released a video in March 2022
                          stating that Nintendo decided to work on the development a little bit longer “in order to make this
                          game’s experience something special.” We can see some of that specialness in today’s gameplay
                          presentation. One of the biggest, most interesting features shown off today was Link’s new Fuse
                          ability, whereby he can take everyday objects like a log or a rock and mash them together to create
                          weapons. It was fascinating watching Aonuma create useful weapons on the fly, and his demonstration
                          of creating a homing arrow by fusing a monster eyeball with an arrow was seriously impressive. But
                          be careful, weapon degradation, that mechanic from Breath of the Wild that players either wildly
                          loved or viciously hated is back with Link’s stick swords breaking after only a couple of swipes.

                          2023 invites the submission of long and short papers on substantial, original, and unpublished
                          research on empirical methods for Natural Language Processing. As in recent years, some of the
                          presentations at the conference will be for papers accepted by the Transactions of the ACL (TACL)
                          and Computational Linguistics (CL) journals. EMNLP 2023 will follow EMNLP 2022 and ACL 2023 and go
                          with a hybrid format with respect to ARR. This means that while EMNLP will accept ARR-reviewed
                          papers, it will also accept submissions directly to EMNLP. However, in order to keep the review
                          load on the community as a whole manageable, we need to ask authors to decide up-front if they want
                          to be reviewed through ARR or EMNLP. Mandatory abstract submission

                          Populist firebrand Giorgia Meloni has been named as Italy’s first female prime minister, becoming
                          the country’s most far-right leader since Benito Mussolini. She received the mandate to form a
                          government from Italy’s President Sergio Mattarella on Friday afternoon after two days of official
                          consultations, and is set to be sworn in at 10 a.m. local time (4 a.m. ET) on Saturday. Last
                          month’s general election resulted in an alliance of far-right and center-right parties, led by her
                          ultraconservative Brothers of Italy, winning enough seats in Italy’s parliament to form a
                          government. Meloni announced her government picks in Rome’s Quirinal Palace, making the leader of
                          Italy’s far right League party, Matteo Salvini, infrastructure minister. Giancarlo Giorgetti, also
                          of the League party, was made economy minister. Antonio Tajani from the Forza Italia party was
                          given the position of minister of foreign affairs while the role of defense minister went to Guido
                          Crosetto, one of the founders of the Brothers of Italy party. The new government will be made up of
                          a coalition of Meloni’s Brothers of Italy party, Salvini’s League party and the Forza Italia party,
                          led by former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. The Brothers of Italy received nine
                          ministries whereas Forza Italia and the League each received five ministries.

                          Poland on 22 and 25 September after injury ruled out Joe Allen. Uncapped James, 18, has played for
                          England Under-20s and was last week included in the Wales Under-21 squad. Senior Wales boss Robert
                          Page has now promoted James to his squad. While a hamstring strain ruled out Allen, defender Ben
                          Davies' small leg fracture forced his absence. Swansea's Allen and Tottenham's Davies picked up the
                          injuries with their clubs. Davies, 29, is expected to be out for around three weeks after suffering
                          his injury in Spurs' Champions League defeat by Sporting Lisbon. Allen came off in Swansea's 3-0

                          three days later. Spurs manager Antonio Conte has said Davies will not be available for Wales duty.
                          "He had an injury in his knee in the game against Sporting Lisbon, and he played with this injury,"
                          Conte told Sky Sports. "It is not a serious injury, I think (he will be back) after the
                          international break because, with the national team, he is not available. "But I think after the
                          international break, he will be available for us." Allen, 32, missed the start of the season with a
                          hamstring problem picked up on Wales duty in June.

                          injuries with their clubs. Davies, 29, is expected to be out for around three weeks after suffering
                          his injury in Spurs' Champions League defeat by Sporting Lisbon. Allen came off in Swansea's 3-0
                          Championship win over Hull on Saturday. Wales travel to Belgium on Thursday before hosting Poland
                          three days later. Spurs manager Antonio Conte has said Davies will not be available for Wales duty.
                          "He had an injury in his knee in the game against Sporting Lisbon, and he played with this injury,"
                          Conte told Sky Sports. "It is not a serious injury, I think (he will be back) after the
                          international break because, with the national team, he is not available. "But I think after the
                          international break, he will be available for us." Allen, 32, missed the start of the season with a

                          hosting the award ceremony since 1996, which recognizes the best and brightest in film and
                          television, as selected by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association. “We recognize the HFPA’s

                          landmark 80th anniversary in January 2023,” Frances Berwick, NBCUniversal Television and

                          plunged into scandal two years ago. On Tuesday, it will try to win back viewers. By Julia Jacobs
                          Follow our live coverage of the Golden Globe Awards 2023. In 2021, actors accepted Golden Globes
                          remotely at a time when organizers were just beginning to grapple with a growing scandal around
                          finances, ethics and diversity in its ranks. Last year, NBC refused to air the show at all, saying
                          that the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the troubled organization at the center of the
                          scandal, needed time to make “meaningful reform.” But on Tuesday, the 80th annual Golden Globe
                          Awards are back on NBC with a show that will attempt to win the trust of viewers and participants.
                          What is not yet clear is how many of those viewers will return, after a precipitous drop in ratings
                          during the pandemic, and whether celebrities and other members of the industry will appear en
                          masse. The Globes have long had a reputation for booziness and irreverence. Will the revived
                          ceremony still be seen as a less-staid alternative to the Academy Awards? Or will the Hollywood
                          Foreign Press take the show more seriously? Here’s a brief history of the ceremony’s downfall, how
                          its organizers are trying to rehabilitate it and what to expect from this year’s telecast.

                          This makes the Pixel Watch a bit more affordable than the Apple Watch Series 8 ($399) but pricier
                          than the Galaxy Watch 5 ($279) and recently-released Fitbit Sense 2 ($299). (See the rest of the
                          differences between the Google Pixel Watch vs. Fitbit Sense 2.) The Pixel Watch release date was
                          October 13, 2022, and since then we're continuing to track the best Pixel Watch deals. Note that
                          the Pixel Watch launched alongside the Google Pixel 7 and Google Pixel 7 Pro, which would both make
                          ideal companion devices for the company's smartwatch. The Google Pixel Watch is a simple-looking
                          smartwatch, I might even call it minimalistic. It comes in just one size: 41mm. Those with larger
                          wrists might complain about the lack of a larger option; that said, it fit me perfectly. The face
                          features a rounded design with a 3D glass dome. This raised effect distracts from the display's
                          thick bezel, but doesn't change the fact that a good chunk of the display is unusable. Perhaps my
                          prior experience with Samsung watches is to blame? I can't help but think it's a missed opportunity
                          to incorporate in digital rotating bezel in that space. It seems like no mistake that the Pixel
                          Watch is a "dark mode" device. The interface and all of Google's watch faces have black backgrounds
                          to further conceal the bezel.

                          affect our editorial independence. Google finally released its first Pixel smartwatch in 2022,
                          impressing us with its usability and features. Now, as the sequel is due, what has the search giant
                          got up its rather ample sleeves? We round up all the news and rumours we’ve seen so far about the
                          Google Pixel Watch 2. There’s no official word yet from Google, and the Google I/O event in May
                          2023 came and went without any mention or tease of an update to the smartwatch range, instead only
                          covering the Pixel 7a, Pixel Fold, and Pixel Tablet. Instead, 9to5Google reports that the Pixel
                          Watch 2 will make its debut in October 2023 alongside the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro. Again, there’s
                          no confirmed price details from Google at this point in time. With the Pixel Watch only being
                          released in October 2022, we don’t think there will be too much change from the price of that
                          smartwatch: We don’t know the official specs of the Google Pixel Watch 2 yet, so we’re relying on
                          the rumours that have surfaced so far to give us a clue on what we might see when the new model
                          arrives.

                          supported the US-led war in Iraq.[50][51] In the leadup to the July election, Abe's Agriculture
                          Minister Toshikatsu Matsuoka committed suicide following a series of political funding scandals. He
                          was the first cabinet member to commit suicide since World War II.[52] Abe's ruling Liberal
                          Democratic Party suffered great losses in the upper house election, losing control for the first
                          time in 52 years. Agricultural minister, Norihiko Akagi, involved in a political funding scandal,
                          resigned after the election. Additionally, Abe's rejection of a possible female Japanese monarch,
                          which led to the Japanese succession controversy, diminished[citation needed] his support base.[53]
                          In an attempt to revive his administration, Abe announced a new cabinet in August 2007. Support for
                          Abe rose by 10 percent as a result. However, the new agricultural minister Takehiko Endo, involved
                          in a finance scandal, resigned only seven days later.[54] On 12 September 2007, only three days
                          after a new parliamentary session had begun, Abe announced his intention to resign his position as
                          prime minister at an unscheduled press conference.[55][56] The announcement came just minutes
                          before opposition leaders were scheduled to question him in Parliament and shocked many. Abe had
                          described himself as a "politician who fights" and previously pledged not to resign.

  - Source              :
                          Japan’s only other state funeral for a political leader since then was held in 1967 for Shigeru
                          Yoshida, who signed the San Francisco Treaty ending the U.S. occupation of Japan and restoring ties
                          with the Allies. Because of criticism that the Yoshida funeral was held without any legal basis,
                          subsequent governments scaled down such events. “A state funeral contradicts the spirit of
                          democracy,” said Junichi Miyama, a historian at Chuo University. Kishida says Abe deserves a state
                          funeral because he was the longest-serving leader in Japan’s modern political history and for his
                          diplomatic, security and economic policies that elevated Japan’s international profile. Kishida,
                          noting Abe’s assassination during an election campaign, says Japan must show its determination
                          never to bow to “violence against democracy.” Political watchers say holding a state funeral for
                          Abe is Kishida’s attempt to please ruling Liberal Democratic Party lawmakers belonging to Abe’s
                          conservative political faction so as to buttress his own grip on power. Koichi Nakano,
                          international politics professor at Sophia University, says the funeral is an attempt to whitewash
                          Abe’s legacy and to cover up scandals linked to the Unification Church. The church is accused of
                          inappropriate recruitment and business tactics but denies the charges. Opponents say it’s
                          undemocratic, citing a lack of a clear legal basis and the unilateral decision by the Kishida
                          Cabinet to hold the funeral.

                          Jump to Like "Game of Thrones" before it, "House of the Dragon" is changing the opening credits to
                          keep up with the storyline in the upcoming episode. Before, we could see things like a new house
                          sigil on a castle after battles were won. Now we see new marriages and children through the
                          channeling of bloodlines in a miniature of Valyria. Daemon never had children with his first wife,
                          Rhea Royce. In episode five, he murdered Rhea before returning to King's Landing for Rhaenyra and
                          Laenor's wedding celebrations. This episode jumps forward 10 years, and Daemon is revealed to be
                          married to Laena Velaryon (Laenor's sister and the daughter of Corlys and Rhaenys). Together,
                          Daemon and Laena have had two children, a development now included in the opening credits as we see
                          the updated family tree. Throughout the first five episodes, the wall decor throughout the Red Keep
                          had a consistent theme of group sex and dragons. But in the sixth episode we see adult-Rhaenrya
                          standing in the same place younger-Alicent once stood when the queen's bedroom belonged to Aemma.
                          Now the walls have a plain tile pattern on them, a sign that Alicent is placing herself in
                          opposition to the "indecent" behaviors of the Targaryens. "Fire and Blood" is the fictional
                          Westerosi history book that serves as the basis for "House of the Dragon.

                          57][58][59] When Banting published the paper that brought him the Nobel,[60] Paulescu already held
                          a patent for his discovery (10 April 1922, patent no. 6254 (8322) "Pancreina şi procedeul
                          fabricaţiei ei"/"Pancrein and the process of making it", from the Romanian Ministry of Industry and
                          Trade).[61][62][63] The Spanish neurophysiologist Fernando de Castro (1896–1967) was the first to
                          describe arterial chemoreceptors and circumscribe them to the carotid body for the respiratory
                          reflexes in 1926–1928. For many experts, this direct disciple of Santiago Ramón y Cajal deserved to
                          share the Nobel Prize 1938 with the awarded Corneille Heymans, but at that time Spain was immersed
                          in the Spanish Civil War and it seems that the Nobel Board even doubted if he was alive or not,
                          being at the front since almost the beginning of the conflict. Heymans himself recognised the
                          merits of De Castro for the Nobel Prize in different occasions, including a famous talk in
                          Montevideo (Uruguay).[64] In 1949, despite protests from the medical establishment, the Portuguese
                          neurologist António Egas Moniz received the Physiology or Medicine Prize for his development of the
                          prefrontal leucotomy, which he promoted by declaring the procedure's success just 10 days
                          postoperative.

                          awarded the 2022 Nobel Prize in literature. The 82-year-old writer is known for works that blur the
                          line between memoir and fiction. In making the announcement, the committee noted the "clinical
                          acuity with which she uncovers the roots, estrangements and collective restraints of personal

                          reach Ernaux to let her know of the award, worth approximately $900,000 in U.S. dollars. Ernaux was
                          born in 1940 in France. Her first book, Cleaned Out, in 1974, was an autobiographical novel about
                          obtaining an abortion when it was still illegal in France. She wrote the book in secret. "My
                          husband had made fun of me after my first manuscript," she told the New York Times in 2020. "I
                          pretended to work on a Ph.D. thesis to have time alone." The book was translated into English in

                          Her most critically acclaimed book is “Les années” (“The Years”), published in 2008. Described by
                          Olsson as “the first collective autobiography,” it depicted Ernaux herself and wider French society
                          from the end of World War II to the 21st century. Its English translation was a finalist for the
                          International Booker Prize in 2019. Ernaux’s “Mémoire de fille” (“A Girl’s Story”), from 2016,
                          follows a young woman’s coming of age in the 1950s, while “Passion Simple” (“Simple Passion”) and
                          “Se perdre” (“Getting Lost”) chart Ernaux’s intense affair with a Russian diplomat. Ernaux has
                          described facing scorn from France’s literary establishment because she is a woman from a
                          working-class background. “My work is political,” she said at the news conference. She described
                          growing up in a milieu outside the elite, a world of “people above you” and the seeming
                          impossibility of becoming a famous writer. The literature prize has long faced criticism that it is
                          too focused on European and North American writers, as well as too male-dominated. Last year’s
                          prize winner, Tanzanian-born, U.K.-based writer Abdulrazak Gurnah, was only the sixth Nobel
                          literature laureate born in Africa.

                          new media. That may have led to the decision by New Fox leaders to start looking for a permanent
                          network chief — and, with Collier available, they pounced. Lachlan Murdoch, who will serve as
                          Chairman and CEO of the new corporate company calling itself “Fox,” called Collier “a singular
                          talent, combining creative success with operational expertise to lead the AMC Network with some of
                          television’s most memorable programming. Charlie’s skills and experience will help Fox continue to
                          transform the broadcast television business.” As CEO of entertainment, Collier will “oversee the

                          scripted and non-scripted content.” The exec, who is currently based on the East Coast, will start
                          to transition into his new job on Nov. 1. Although Collier’s appointment is a bit of a surprise, it
                          gives Fox a fresh pair of eyes to strategize its new space in the entertainment ecosystem. Fox is
                          already bulking up with more live event programming in primetime, including Thursday Night Football
                          and (starting next year) WWE Smackdown wrestling.

                          Max Verstappen clinched what had long been expected with his win at the 2022 Japanese Grand Prix:
                          this year's drivers' title crown. It makes him a double world champion at 25 and now he's close to
                          breaking Formula 1's record for most wins in a single season, with four events still left to run.
                          But Verstappen's title celebrations were overshadowed by the chaos and confusion during and after
                          the wet race last Sunday, which has led to even more questions being raised about the procedures
                          and attitudes of motorsport's governing body. There was also plenty of intrigue further down the
                          field and off the track too. Here are the headline takeaways from F1's first visit back to Suzuka

                          the Ferrari driver's latest error gifting Sergio Perez second, came Verstappen's coronation.

                          pole, then beat his rival in the race's two main challenges.

                          be leaping through realities, but he won’t be the only one. The Quantum Leap revival series will
                          debut on NBC later this month, and the first official trailer has been released. The Quantum Leap
                          revival follows a new team who has been assembled to restart the Quantum Leap project in the hopes
                          of understanding the mysteries behind the machine and the man who created it. Raymond Lee stars as
                          Dr. Ben Seong, a world-renowned physicist and man of faith who finds himself stuck in the late
                          1980s with amnesia after using the Quantum leap technology on himself. In addition to Raymond Lee,
                          Quantum Leap also stars Caitlin Bassett also stars as Addison, who appears in the form of a
                          hologram only Ben can see or hear; Mason Alexander Park as Ian Wright, who runs the AI unit Ziggy;

                          as Herbert “Magic” Williams, a Vietnam veteran and head of the time travel project at Quantum Leap.
                          The Quantum Leap trailer looks like a lot of fun, but I know most fans are waiting for the
                          inevitable moment when Scott Bakula returns as Sam Beckett. According to Ernie Hudson, the
                          invitation to return as been extended to Scott Bakula to reprise his role. “I’ve always appreciated
                          his work,” Hudson said.

                          works. What you need to know about Nvidia's new GeForce RTX 4090 The Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 is now
                          available. This GPU is currently among the most powerful on the market, and if you want to play the
                          latest games at the highest framerates, you'll need the best gaming PCs packing high-octane cards
                          like this one. Presently, the GeForce RTX 4090 is the top-of-the-line card in Nvidia's 40-series of
                          GeForce RTX GPUs, which were officially announced in September 2022. The Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080
                          and 4090 were unveiled during Nvidia's September 2022 GTC keynote. Together, they've established a
                          new high-water mark for what we can expect from consumer-grade graphics cards. At that Nvidia
                          event, we learned when these cards are coming out, how much they'll cost, and what kind of power we
                          ought to expect from them. The Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 is the cream of the crop — here's everything
                          you need to know about it. The Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 went on sale on October 12, 2022. The card
                          has a starting price of $1,599. That's roughly as much as the rest of the PC you'll put it in will
                          cost, so start saving now!

                          Nvidia's RTX 4060 is right around the corner, so it's really no surprise that the first benchmarks
                          are already starting to leak out. Today, two tests have been spotted, and they bode pretty well for
                          the GPU. The RTX 3060, which is still a favorite among Nvidia users, might be around 20% slower
                          than the upcoming Ada Lovelace model. Will the RTX 4060 become one of the best GPUs, or at least
                          one of the most popular models in this generation? One might think that a GPU that costs over
                          $40,000 is going to be the best graphics card for gaming, but the truth is a lot more complex than
                          that. In fact, this Nvidia GPU can't even keep up with integrated graphics solutions. Now, before
                          you get too upset, you should know I'm referring to Nvidia's H100, which houses the GH100 chip
                          (Grace Hopper). It's a powerful data center GPU made to handle high-performance computing (HPC)
                          tasks -- not power PC games. It doesn't have any display outputs, and despite its extensive
                          capabilities, it also doesn't have any coolers. This is because, again, you'd find this GPU in a
                          data center or server setting, where it'd be cooled with powerful external fans. Nvidia has just
                          quietly announced the official release date of the RTX 4060. The GPU is coming out on June 29 and
                          will be priced at $299.

                          are already starting to leak out. Today, two tests have been spotted, and they bode pretty well for
                          the GPU. The RTX 3060, which is still a favorite among Nvidia users, might be around 20% slower
                          than the upcoming Ada Lovelace model. Will the RTX 4060 become one of the best GPUs, or at least
                          one of the most popular models in this generation? One might think that a GPU that costs over
                          $40,000 is going to be the best graphics card for gaming, but the truth is a lot more complex than
                          that. In fact, this Nvidia GPU can't even keep up with integrated graphics solutions. Now, before
                          you get too upset, you should know I'm referring to Nvidia's H100, which houses the GH100 chip
                          (Grace Hopper). It's a powerful data center GPU made to handle high-performance computing (HPC)
                          tasks -- not power PC games. It doesn't have any display outputs, and despite its extensive
                          capabilities, it also doesn't have any coolers. This is because, again, you'd find this GPU in a
                          data center or server setting, where it'd be cooled with powerful external fans. Nvidia has just
                          quietly announced the official release date of the RTX 4060. The GPU is coming out on June 29 and
                          will be priced at $299.

                          27][28][29] In an interview with CNET, Park stated that there were no plans to shut down Fitbit,
                          adding that the Google Fit app would co-exist with Fitbit on the Pixel Watch.[30] Google CEO Sundar
                          Pichai was seen wearing a Pixel Watch in September during an interview at the Code 2022
                          conference.[31][32] Google officially announced the Pixel Watch on October 6, alongside the Pixel 7
                          and Pixel 7 Pro smartphones, at the annual Made by Google event.[33] It became available for
                          pre-orders on the same day, before being released in nine countries on October 13.[34] When asked
                          why Google waited so long before launching the device, Osterloh cited their acquisition of Fitbit
                          and its expansive health platform as the primary catalyst which convinced Google to greenlight the
                          Pixel Watch, adding that the company was committed to first-party wearables.[35] The Pixel Watch is
                          available in two models, one with and one without support for cellular connectivity.[38] Its case
                          has a diameter of 41 mm (1.6 in) and a Gorilla Glass 5 display. Powered by Samsung's Exynos 9110
                          SoC alongside the ARM Cortex-M33 co-processor, it contains a 294 mAh battery and 2 GB of RAM, as

                          mechanism manufactured by Compal Electronics.

                          The rub is that it depends on Google to commit to the long haul… and we all know that Google’s
                          reputation on that front isn’t great. On the one hand, Google’s made a lot of noise about its
                          vision for ambient computing. Wearables seem to be an integral part of that. On the other, we all
                          saw how Google neglected Android Wear, and then Wear OS, for years before it started reversing
                          course in 2019. Call me an optimist, but I’m of the mind that Google’s invested way too much at
                          this point to throw in the towel. You shouldn’t buy a device based on its promise Still, you
                          shouldn’t buy a device based on its promise. And on that front, the Pixel Watch is a
                          good-but-not-yet-great smartwatch for Android users. At $349 (or $399 for LTE, not including
                          carrier fees), the Pixel Watch is competitively priced. It’s about $70 more than the 40mm Galaxy
                          Watch 5, but I’d argue it’s the better choice for anyone who doesn’t have a Samsung phone. (It’s
                          also a good option for Samsung owners, though the Galaxy Watch 5 lineup is a slightly better option
                          if you’re all in on Samsung services.) And even with its flaws, the Fitbit integration is going to
                          get you a better health tracking experience than Google Fit on Wear OS 2 ever will.

                          "Rohan" was being targeted for a 2022 release, featuring a round bezel-less design, integration
                          with Fitbit, proprietary watch bands, and health-tracking capabilities.[19][20] Evidence unearthed

                          6 smartphone line.[21] In April 2022, the "Fitbit" category was renamed "Watches" on the online
                          Google Store, in anticipation of the Pixel Watch's impending launch.[22] The same month, Google

                          whose public sector career spans both government and non-profit organizations, brings extensive
                          knowledge of park equity and community development to the position, as well as strong leadership in
                          driving sustainable impact for civic organizations. Monaco is the first Black leader of the
                          Alliance, further diversifying executive leadership within the open space sector, and continues the
                          legacy of female leadership at the Alliance over the course of its 35-year history. Monaco succeeds
                          former Prospect Park Alliance President Sue Donoghue, who was appointed New York City Parks
                          Commissioner earlier this year. Monaco looks forward to working with the board, staff and most

                          recover, she looks forward to strengthening the organization’s capacity in order to keep pace with
                          the needs of the park community and the robust use of the park. She plans to leverage her
                          experience in working on citywide equity initiatives and serving vulnerable communities to explore
                          the ways in which the Alliance can bring more social services to the park.

                          Advertisement Supported by By Lisa W. Foderaro The Prospect Park Alliance, the nonprofit group that
                          raises money for and oversees the daily operation of Brooklyn’s most visited park, has appointed a
                          former New York City parks official as its new president. Sue Donoghue, who oversaw Mayor Michael
                          R. Bloomberg’s sustainability and parks blueprint known as PlaNYC, succeeds Emily Lloyd, who left
                          to lead the city’s Department of Environmental Protection for Mayor Bill de Blasio. Ms. Donoghue
                          lives a block from the park. “With three kids, the park is a big part of our daily existence,” said
                          Ms. Donoghue, whose appointment was approved by the alliance’s board on Tuesday evening. “It’s our
                          backyard and front yard.” The Prospect Park Alliance, founded in 1987, was one of the first
                          conservancies that set out to transform a long-neglected park. (The Central Park Conservancy began
                          in 1980.) And with its help, the park has undergone a series of renovation and restoration
                          projects. Last year, the park unveiled the LeFrak Center at Lakeside, a $74 million project that
                          includes two skating rinks; the southeast corner of the park was also restored and redesigned. Like
                          the leaders of several major park conservancies, Ms. Donoghue, 49, will serve as both the
                          alliance’s president and the park’s official administrator for the parks department.

                          note 1] The company also teased further games — Project A, a tactical shooter; Project L, a
                          fighting game with League of Legends characters; and Project F, a multiplayer game set in Runeterra
                          – that were not detailed outside of genre descriptions and brief gameplay clips.[28][29] Project A

                          officially released on June 2, 2020.[31] In December 2019, Riot Games announced Riot Forge, a

                          for the creation of League of Legends games, with some games of this type already being in
                          development.[32] Two titles from Riot Forge were announced at The Game Awards 2019: Ruined King: A

                          tabletop games; the first was Tellstones: King's Gambit, released in 2020.[34] Riot acquired
                          Hypixel Studios in April 2020, which they had been investing in over the previous eighteen months
                          to help them publish Hytale, a voxel-based sandbox game.[35] Also in April, Riot announced plans to

                          So there are now people running each one of those businesses who have their own P&L and can run
                          with them, which is I think, the only way to run a portfolio business. So I’m excited for each one
                          of them to drive those opportunities. I would presume knowing you that those GMs have if they’re
                          not product people, they have deep respect for product. So how do you think those products, if you
                          want to pick one or two, are going to change? Ladder those changes you want to see in the product

                          in the in the digital industry. Well, I actually think that this this market downturn, while rough
                          for the economy, and rough for others, is coming along at a great time for us because we just
                          became a private company again for the first time in over 25 years. That really gives you the air
                          cover to treat the products right, to make changes the way I’ve done, but then also, to go back to
                          the beginning. I really think top to bottom, every one of these products can be modernized and
                          improved. That includes little things like the freshness of the news feed. I just came out of a

                          Netflix share prices soared more than 14% as the company reported better-than-expected results on
                          the top line and bottom line on October 18, 2022. Additionally, the streamer announced an increase
                          of 2.41 million net global subscribers, more than double the additions the firm had expected a
                          quarter earlier. The number of paid memberships at the end of each quarterly period of 2021 and
                          2022 increased significantly in the US and Canada (UCAN), and the Europe, Middle East and Africa

                          GlobalData. For Q3 2022, the total revenue and net profit of Netflix was $7,925.59 million and
                          $1,398.24 million, respectively. Netflix will begin a crackdown on password-sharing in 2023 to
                          force users who have been using borrowed accounts to create their own. The company will also allow
                          users who share accounts to set up sub-accounts so that they can pay for friends or family members
                          to use their accounts.

                          your faces to take you on a brief journey into the future as we explore what the next, new episode
                          4 of Chicago PD’s current season 10 will be showing you when it comes out next Wednesday night,
                          October 12, 2022. We were able to snag up an official teaser description for one of episode 4’s
                          main storylines via NBC’s official episode 4 press release. So, we’re going to certainly take a
                          look at it right now. Let’s go. First off, NBC revealed that there is an official title for this
                          new episode 4 of Chicago PD’s current season 10. It turns out that the writers decided to name it,
                          “DONDE VIVES.” It sounds like episode 4 will feature some more very scandalous, intense, dramatic,
                          interesting, action-filled and suspenseful scenes. In the new episode 4, a shocking murder and a
                          rookie officer will be the main focus of this storyline that NBC chose to serve up on a platter.
                          Yep, it turns out that some major scandal will loom in this episode as very startling murder will
                          take place at some point.

                          said in an email shared by 9to5Google. However, if you were grandfathered in at a lower price as a
                          former Google Play Music subscriber, you’ll pay that lower rate until your April billing date,

                          YouTube Originals for everyone. Now, free users can watch YouTube Originals content with ads, just
                          like any other video. The company vaguely states that "only select episodes may be available for

                          director's cuts. Have a look at the YouTube Originals channel to see what's available. Some videos,

                          YouTube Premium. If you don't already subscribe to Spotify, Apple Music, or similar, then you can

                          no concrete information since September 2021, fans are desperate to get their hands on this sequel.
                          Sony finally saw fit to shed some more light on the project in a recent blog post. The story seems

                          see the game finally get an official release, it comes after a wave of intense harassment that the
                          developers at Sony Santa Monica faced. Some developers even shared that they were being sent
                          unsolicited Dick Pics due to the game not revealing a release date. Yes, Sony Santa Monica revealed
                          a three-minute trailer that goes into quite a bit of detail about the story of God of War Ragnarök.
                          In addition, a CG trailer was released along with the game's release date announcement. It features

Question 196              : Who is the new prime minister of the United Kingdom?
Correct Answers         :  
                          Rishi Sunak
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          The former chancellor wins Conservative Party leadership contest days after the dramatic
                          resignation of Liz Truss as prime minister. Rishi Sunak will become the United Kingdom’s new prime
                          minister after winning the ruling Conservative Party’s leadership contest, which was triggered by
                          the resignation of Liz Truss last week. Sunak’s win on Monday came days after Truss’s resignation
                          after her disastrous tax cuts plans and policy U-turns plunged the markets into chaos. The
                          unprecedented economic crisis drew a rare intervention from the Bank of England. Britain faces
                          serious economic challenges and needs stability and unity, Sunak said on Monday in his first public
                          speech since winning the contest. “There is no doubt we face a profound economic challenge,” Sunak
                          said. “We now need stability and unity, and I will make it my utmost priority to bring our party
                          and our country together.” Sunak, a former finance minister, has been left with the task of
                          steering a deeply divided country through an economic downturn set to make millions of people
                          poorer. Al Jazeera’s Andrew Simmons, reporting from London, said Sunak is “pretty well placed”
                          despite the challenges ahead. “In some ways, … some of his work has already been done in terms of
                          putting out the fires that Liz Truss created because it did cause a storm in the markets,” Simmons
                          said.

                          “The whole list of tax cuts and ideas that frankly, according to Sunak and others, belongs to
                          Disneyland because none of it was going to be really possible without crashing the economy more,”
                          he said. Sunak’s only challenger, Penny Mordaunt, leader of the House of Commons and former defence
                          minister, was reportedly backed by 30 MPs compared with nearly 150 supporting Sunak. “This decision
                          is an historic one and shows, once again, the diversity and talent of our party,” Mordaunt said in
                          a statement as she withdrew from the race just minutes before the winner was due to be announced.
                          “Rishi has my full support.” Sunak and Mordaunt had lost to Truss last month in the race to appoint
                          a successor to then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson. He was forced to announce his resignation in July
                          after a wave of scandals linked to parties held during the COVID-19 lockdown. Sunak will be the
                          UK’s first leader of colour and the first Hindu to take the top job. At 42, he will also be the
                          youngest prime minister in more than 200 years. The multimillionaire former hedge fund boss will be
                          expected to impose deep spending cuts to try to rebuild the UK’s fiscal reputation, just as the
                          country slides into a recession, dragged down by the surging costs of energy and food. He will also
                          inherit a political party that has fractured along ideological lines, a challenge that damaged the
                          fortunes of several former Conservative leaders.

                          (born May 12, 1980, Southampton, England), British politician and financier who became leader of
                          the Conservative Party and prime minster of the United Kingdom in October 2022. Previously he
                          served as chancellor of the Exchequer (2020–22). Sunak was born into a family with immigrant roots.
                          His grandparents emigrated from Punjab, in northwestern India, to East Africa, where his mother and
                          father were born in Tanzania and Kenya, respectively. They met and married after their families
                          migrated in the 1960s to Southampton in southern England. Sunak’s father became a general
                          practitioner for the National Health Service. His mother, a pharmacist, owned and operated a small
                          pharmacy, for which Sunak, the eldest of their three children, would eventually keep the books.
                          Later, during his political career, Sunak would draw parallels between his experiences working in
                          the family business and the values he gained from them and those of Conservative Party icon
                          Margaret Thatcher, the daughter of a grocer. As a result of his parents’ sacrifices and saving to
                          fund his education, Sunak was able to attend Winchester College, the exclusive private school that
                          has produced no fewer than six chancellors of the Exchequer.

                          cheapest plan, the $9.99 Basic plan. It's Netflix's first foray into the ad-supported space — the
                          streamer has for years resisted putting any advertising on its platform. The company's plan arrives
                          on Nov. 3, a month before rival streaming service Disney+ will introduce its own ad-supported tier,
                          and competes with ad-supported plans from services like Hulu and Peacock. The plan's launch comes
                          as Netflix is preparing to crack down on password sharing on its platform. Beginning next year,
                          Netflix will push people who borrow accounts to create their own, and will also give
                          account-holders who share their passwords the ability to pay extra to have friends and family on
                          their accounts. Here's what you need to know about Netflix's Basic With Ads tier. The Basic With
                          Ads plan will operate similarly to the Basic plan. Users will have access to a 720p video stream —
                          versus the 1080p stream offered by the $15.49 Standard plan and the 4K plan offered by the $19.99
                          Premium plan — which can be accessed from any internet-connected device.

                          ad-supported tier launched in November 2022. Netflix said Wednesday at its 2023 Upfront
                          presentation that almost 5 million people are using the service's ad-supported tier, called
                          Standard with ads (formerly it was Basic with ads). Netflix also said the number of people who've
                          signed up for the ad-tier plan has more than doubled since the start of 2023. "More than a quarter
                          of our signups now choose the ads plan in countries where it's available," Greg Peters, Netflix's
                          co-CEO, said in a news release. "Engagement on our ads plan is similar to our comparable non-ads
                          plans." Netflix launched the ad-supported tier in November 2022. It costs less than similar plans
                          from other streaming services, like Disney Plus and HBO Max (soon to be called just Max). These
                          other ad-supported tiers cost $10 a month while Netflix's costs $7 a month. Netflix said Wednesday
                          that its ad-supported plan has almost 5 million global monthly active users, which is a different
                          measure than subscribers, since multiple people in a household can use one Netflix account.

                          Queen Elizabeth's death in September, Harry and Meghan stepping back from their royal roles, and
                          the controversy surrounding Prince Andrew—fans of The Crown have been anticipating a season set in
                          the modern day. Though the series likely won't make it all the way to 2022, the critically

                          The new Four Seasons property for Season 2 is the San Domenico Palace in Taormina, a city on the
                          Mediterranean island's northern coast—and like in Season 1, the resort is no motel. The property
                          boasts 111 suites, a spa, courtyards and gardens from the time of the monks, as well as a
                          fine-dining restaurant and a pool-terrace diner. To top it off, the estate features an outdoor
                          infinity pool, which has won over a considerable amount of screen time, per Condé Nast Traveler.
                          The show's previous location in Hawaii at the Four Seasons Maui was a choice inspired by the fond
                          childhood memories of director Mike White, and its new location bounces off of this. “The longer I
                          spent time there, the more I realized just how complex it is," he said to The New Yorker in July
                          2021. "And it just felt like that might be interesting as a backdrop to this show." On the
                          southeast side of the island is the coastal area of Noto, where characters Harper Spiller (Aubrey
                          Plaza) and Daphne Sullivan (Meghann Fahy) take an overnight ladies' trip to the town's Palazzo
                          Ducezio in a series of revelatory and memorable new scenes. Cefalù, a coastal town on the island's
                          north coast, also serves as a backdrop for many landscape shots featured throughout Season 2.

                          States Congress.[6][7] Initially expected to be one of the most widely contested elections in the
                          nation, Kelly amassed a massive fundraising advantage over Masters, raising a record $75 million
                          dollars, compared to Masters's $12 million.[67] Due to the Supreme Court's ruling to overturn Roe
                          Vs. Wade, which gave states the right to ban abortion, Kelly spent heavily attacking Masters over
                          his anti abortion stance, which was seen as hurting Masters especially among women voters. He also
                          attacked Masters's support for privatizing social security, as Arizona has many retired seniors

Question 202              : which party controls the house after 2022 midterm elections?
Correct Answers         :  
                          Republican 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                          Although election ‘red wave’ did not happen, GOP flipped enough seats to win slim majority in House
                          of Representatives. United States Republicans have regained control of the House of
                          Representatives, securing a narrow majority in a midterm election that saw the party fail to meet
                          expectations. The Associated Press declared Republican Mike Garcia the winner in California’s 27th
                          congressional district Wednesday, giving the GOP 218 seats, the threshold for the majority needed
                          to take over the lower chamber of Congress. Republican Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy will likely
                          become House speaker when the new Congress convenes early next year after his party nominated him
                          to the position on Tuesday. He will replace Democrat Nancy Pelosi who has held the gavel since
                          2019. Although the much-anticipated “red wave” of Republican victories did not materialise,
                          Republican candidates were able to gain at least five House seats in the November 8 midterms,
                          wiping out the Democrats’ thin majority. Democrats were able to flip a few districts, but they
                          suffered overall net losses, narrowly losing key races in New York, Florida and other states.
                          Redistricting after the 2020 Census had given conservatives an edge in several parts of the
                          country. Even with a less-than-ideal election performance, control of the House will allow
                          Republicans to halt President Joe Biden’s legislative agenda in its tracks. In the US, bills need
                          to pass in both the House and Senate and be approved by the president to become law.

  - Source              :
                          "Lullaby" is a song by English rock band the Cure from their eighth studio album, Disintegration
                          (1989). Released as a single on 10 April 1989, the song is the band's highest-charting single in
                          their home country, reaching number five on the UK Singles Chart. It additionally reached number
                          three in West Germany and Ireland while becoming a top-10 hit in several other European countries
                          and New Zealand. The music video, directed by Tim Pope, won the British Video of the Year at the
                          1990 Brit Awards. The meaning of "Lullaby" has been speculated by fans, including as a metonymy for
                          addiction, depression, or sexual assault,[2] and Smith has offered multiple explanations as to its
                          theme or content, such as childhood nightmares or abuse.[2] One explanation by Smith follows that
                          the song is about the disturbing songs his father sung to him as a kid, and the horrible ending
                          they would always have.[3] Tim Pope, a long-time collaborator of the Cure on many of its music
                          videos, interprets "Lullaby" as an allegory for lead singer Robert Smith's drug-addled past.[4]
                          Upon its release, "Lullaby" became the Cure's highest-charting hit in their home country when it
                          reached number five on the UK Singles Chart. It remains their only single to reach the top five in
                          the United Kingdom.

Question 205              : Who is the Doctor's new companion in Doctor Who?
Correct Answers         :  
                          Millie Gibson

  - Answer              : Millie Gibson

  - Source              :
                          Gibson will join Ncuti Gatwa aboard the TARDIS. Millie Gibson will be the new Doctor Who companion,
                          joining Ncuti Gatwa for adventures in time and space. The casting was revealed during this year's
                          Children in Need broadcast on BBC One. Gibson, best known for playing Kelly Neelan on ITV soap
                          Coronation Street for three years, will play a character named Ruby Sunday. Alongside Gatwa, Millie
                          Gibson will make her Doctor Who debut over the festive season in 2023 when the Fifteenth Doctor
                          takes control of the TARDIS. "Whilst still being in total disbelief, I am beyond honoured to be
                          cast as the Doctor’s companion," said Gibson. "It is a gift of a role, and a dream come true, and I
                          will do everything to try and fill the boots the fellow companions have travelled in before me. And
                          what better way to do that than being by the fabulous Ncuti Gatwa’s side, I just can’t wait to get
                          started." Gatwa added: "Millie just is the companion. She is full of talent, strength, she has a
                          cheeky sparkle in her eye and is sharp as a razor. From the moment she walked into the room she
                          captured all of our attention with her effervescence and then solidified that attention with the
                          sheer torque of her talent. This adventure is going to be so wild and so fun, I cannot wait to sail
                          the universe with Millie!

                          Argentina and Saudi Arabia. The two teams had faced each other four times prior to the tournament,
                          most recently in 2012, a 0–0 draw in a friendly game. Saudi Arabia defeated Argentina and ended
                          their 36-match unbeaten streak.[6] According to Gracenote, the win was the "most surprising" in
                          World Cup history, with many calling it one of the biggest World Cup upsets in history.[7] This was
                          also the second consecutive time that Argentina did not win their opening match at a World Cup,
                          after drawing 1–1 with Iceland in 2018; and the first time since 1990 that Argentina lost their
                          opening match.

Question 210              : What is the title of the new season of "Criminal Minds"?

  - Source              :
                          By Selome Hailu The Paramount+ revival of “Criminal Minds” has set a new title: “Criminal Minds:
                          Evolution.” Additionally, Zach Gilford has been added to the cast as a recurring guest star.
                          “Criminal Minds: Evolution” will premiere this fall, expanding upon the long-running series that
                          originally concluded in 2020 after 15 seasons. The revival follows the FBI’s elite team of criminal
                          profilers as they come up against their greatest threat yet, an UnSub who has used the pandemic to
                          build a network of other serial killers. As the world opens back up and the network goes
                          operational, the team must hunt them down, one murder at a time. Gilford will play Elias Voit, an
                          operations analyst for a global cyber-security firm who has a dark side and an obsession with
                          death. Gilford is best known for starring in all five seasons of “Friday Night Lights” as Matt
                          Saracen. More recently, he has appeared in TV projects including “Good Girls” on NBC, “Midnight
                          Mass” on Netflix and the Spectrum Original series “L.A.’s Finest,” as well as films such as “The
                          Purge: Anarchy.” He will next be seen in the ensemble of Netflix’s “The Fall of the House of
                          Usher,” a horror series from Mike Flanagan.

                          pic.twitter.com/rr9eerBvtW Rhule wouldn’t share specific plans about who he might be bringing along
                          with him, but said he would definitely be talking with — and listening to — players, coaches, and
                          staff before making changes. Coming off a big win on Black Friday, Huskers are most interested in
                          hearing about whether Interim Head Coach Mickey Joseph, who took the helm after Scott Frost was
                          fired, would be retained. “I reached out to Mickey right when I got the job. Looking forward to
                          talking to him at some point and talking to the rest of the staff. I’ve been on both sides of it,”
                          Rhule said. “I’ve been an assistant coach on a staff that’s been let go, and I’ve always
                          appreciated the coach coming in and talking to me. So I’ll try to be thorough with that process
                          over the next couple of days.” Alberts said the decision about whether to keep Joseph was entirely
                          in Rhule’s hands. “Ultimately, this is going to be Matt Rhule’s decision,” Alberts said. “He’s the
                          head coach and he needs to hire the 10 assistant head coaches he believes gives him the best
                          opportunity.” Rhule also talked Monday about his affinity for Nebraska. “My son is this YouTube
                          generation. I have seen the Tunnel Walk maybe 5,000 times.

                          and a New Year’s Six Bowl appearance. Then came a less stellar NFL stint that ended after an 11-27
                          record in two-and-a-half seasons. It’s unclear what the exact contract details are as the Panthers
                          owe over $40 million in buyout money. It’s also unclear what the hire means for interim head coach
                          Mickey Joseph and Nebraska’s assistants. Rhule will have a tall task ahead of him. Neither of the
                          last two head coaches in Lincoln left with a winning record, and no coach has left on his own
                          volition since Tom Osborne retired 25 years ago. The Huskers just wrapped up a 4-8 season and have
                          not had a winning season or reached a bowl game since 2016. But the financial resources, fan
                          support, brand and facilities are in place to be competitive toward the top of the Big Ten. “It is
                          a tremendous honor to be chosen to lead the Nebraska Football program,” Rhule said in a release.
                          “When you think of great, tradition-rich programs in college football Nebraska is right at the top
                          of the list. The fan base is second to none, and I consider it a privilege to have the opportunity

                          Across the Yahoo Network Thu, October 27, 2022 at 2:01:02 PM EDT The voice behind TikTok’s
                          text-to-speech feature has spoken — and she’s a Canadian local radio host. Kat Callaghan hosts The
                          Beat on 91.5 FM in Ontario. She also made a major reveal this month: She’s the voice of TikTok’s
                          text-to-speech feature. Iconic! Callaghan confessed in her very first TikTok video. For a long time
                          I didn’t say a word. But … yes it’s me and yes I have an ongoing awesome relationship with the
                          folks at TikTok. 🎉 The coolest part for me is watching the creativity & awesome content that people
                          are putting out there using my voice. (Also oddly enough this is my first TikTok) “When you guys
                          have been asking me if I’m the voice on TikTok,” the text-to-speech caption said. “Finally I can
                          tell you guys: It is me,” Callaghan said in her authentic voice. In the caption, she explained that
                          she has an awesome ongoing relationship with TikTok. “The coolest part for me is watching the
                          creativity & awesome content that people are putting out there using my voice,” Callaghan wrote.
                          The video received over 29.4 million views. Some were in shock, but not everyone believed she was
                          the voice they had heard for so long.

                          In 2022, SM terminated its production license contract with founder Lee Soo-man's company Like
                          Planning.[87] On December 1, SM announced that the company will be setting up its Southeast Asian
                          headquarters in Singapore, which will be managing joint ventures in Indonesia, Thailand and
                          Vietnam.[2] The company plans to launch retail businesses such as cafes, merchandise stores and
                          pop-up exhibitions in the country.[1] On February 3, 2023, SM released a video titled "SM 3.0:
                          Producing Strategy Multi 'Production Center/Label' System" on their official YouTube channel, in
                          which co-CEOs Lee Sung-soo and Tak Young-jun revealed that the label is passing from its "2.0" era
                          to the "3.0 era", with major adjustments to come concerning the label's operations. These include
                          shifting from a one-man production system led by founder and executive producer Lee Soo-man and his
                          private production house to a system under which multiple production teams, both internal and
                          external, would supervise music production and artist promotions. A goal of the new system is to
                          avoid production delays. In the video, Lee and Tak also shared that SM will debut four new artists
                          in 2023, including a new girl group managed by Lee, virtual soloist Naevis managed by Park
                          Joon-young, and the Japanese unit of NCT and a new boy group managed by Tak.

                          In Japan, SM co-publishes Avex Trax releases for artists including Ayumi Hamasaki, Namie Amuro, and
                          Koda Kumi, as well as Johnny's Entertainment artists such as Arashi and KAT-TUN.[12] After
                          graduating from California State University, Northridge in the United States, Lee Soo-man returned
                          to Korea and in 1989 established what was then known as "SM Studio" in the Apgujeong neighborhood
                          of Gangnam, Seoul and signed singer Hyun Jin-young. During the 1990s, SM Studio developed an
                          in-house system that looked after all aspects of its artists' careers.[13] Lee's approach was
                          targeted at teenage audiences, and took a holistic view of the qualities needed to become a
                          successful entertainer.[14] In February 1995, the company changed its name to SM Entertainment and
                          set up its capital fund.[15] SM then developed an in-house production system and created a string
                          of successful artists, including boy band H.O.T. in 1996, girl group S.E.S. in 1997, boy band
                          Shinhwa in 1998, R&B duo Fly to the Sky in 1999, and soloist BoA in 2000. Jung Hae-ik was appointed
                          CEO at the time of SM's official reestablishment in 1995,[16] and was succeeded by Kim Kyung-wook
                          in 1998.[citation needed]

                          his first World Cup goal, but the spirited effort wasn’t enough to topple a talented, physical and
                          organized Dutch side. In its return to the global stage for the first time in eight years, the USA
                          fielded four of the five youngest line-ups in the World Cup so far and reached the knockout stage
                          for the fourth time in its last five World Cup appearances. While the USA held the better of
                          possession for long stretches of the match and held a 17-11 margin in shots and eight to six in
                          shots on goal, the Dutch proved more decisive in both penalty boxes and were able to damage the
                          young Americans on the break throughout the evening. The USA dominated the game’s opening minutes
                          and nearly got off to a dream start when the midfielder Weston McKennie won a ball at the top of
                          the Dutch penalty area, looping it over his head and into the path of forward Christian Pulisic who
                          was behind the defense but in an onside position.

                          Brazil defeated Spain 1-0 in the first round of the group stage, but both teams progressed to the
                          round of 16, and both were eliminated in a penalty shootout in the quarter-finals that year. After
                          performing below expectations in the last two World Cups, Spain will be keen to eliminate Brazil,

                          to progress from the group stages (90.2%) according to our model. It’ll be a relief for them, as
                          the runners-up in that group likely face current champions France in the last 16. By topping their
                          group, Argentina would then face Denmark, the predicted runners-up in Group D. In the
                          quarter-finals, their battle would be against the Netherlands from Group A, who would have
                          eliminated the USA in the first round of the knockouts. USA are projected to finish second in Group
                          B, ahead of Wales and Iran. Argentina arrive at the World Cup on the back of a 35-game unbeaten run
                          (W24 D11), the longest in their history.

                          It’s coming this summer Margot Robbie will officially play Barbie in an upcoming live-action film
                          that Warner Bros. and Mattel announced in 2019. The Oscar-nominated actress will also coproduce the
                          movie under her company, LuckyChap Entertainment, alongside husband Tom Ackerley and producer Josey

                          toys. Here’s what we know so far. “Since the first little girl ever existed, there have been
                          dolls,” a voice narrates in the opening shot in the first teaser trailer for Barbie, which came out
                          in December 2022. The camera pans over little girls sitting desolately in a desert. “But the dolls
                          were always and forever baby dolls, until …” Enter Robbie, who appears as a giant first iteration
                          of the Mattel doll from 1959, complete with a pin-up ponytail and a black-and-white striped
                          swimsuit. In a trailer released in April 2023, a firm plot for the film still seemed to be under
                          wraps, but there were hints at trouble in paradise for Barbie (Margot Robbie) and Ken (Ryan
                          Gosling). Barbie seems to want some independence and space, while Ken is being quite clingy. What
                          does this mean for the rest of the Barbie-verse!?

                          now, the film’s release date is July 21, 2023. The film has landed another heavy hitter for its
                          male lead. Blue Valentine actor Ryan Gosling is in final negotiations to play Barbie’s beau Ken,
                          per Deadline. The Academy Award nominee has apparently been the studio’s only choice from the
                          beginning, and he has now signed on after finding an opening in his schedule. With Gosling signing
                          on, it looks like the long-awaited project can start filming in early 2022. Several cast
                          announcements have been rolling out in the past few weeks, with major stars joining Robbie and
                          Gosling in the upcoming film. One surprising casting, Sex Education star Emma Mackey, has drawn
                          attention since she and Robbie look so similar. While no details from the plot have been released,
                          the castings add more allure to Gerwig’s take on the Mattel doll’s story.

                          of the Mattel doll from 1959, complete with a pin-up ponytail and a black-and-white striped
                          swimsuit. In a trailer released in April 2023, a firm plot for the film still seemed to be under
                          wraps, but there were hints at trouble in paradise for Barbie (Margot Robbie) and Ken (Ryan
                          Gosling). Barbie seems to want some independence and space, while Ken is being quite clingy. What
                          does this mean for the rest of the Barbie-verse!?

                          Tyler Adams will captain the US men’s national team into the 2022 FIFA World Cup, head coach Gregg
                          Berhalter announced on the eve of Monday’s Group B opener vs. Wales (2 pm ET | FOX, Telemundo). The
                          Leeds United midfielder and New York Red Bulls homegrown product will be the USMNT’s youngest
                          captain since Walter Bahr at the 1950 World Cup. He’s already worn the armband nine times during 32
                          career international appearances. “We think he has great leadership capabilities,” Berhalter said
                          of the 23-year-old Wappingers Falls, New York native. “He leads by his actions and his words.” FIFA
                          requires teams to name a singular captain for the tournament; the USMNT were the last of 32
                          Qatar-qualified squads to complete that task. During Berhalter’s tenure, the USMNT have relied on a
                          leadership council and rotating armband responsibilities. Chelsea forward Christian Pulisic and
                          Nashville SC center back Walker Zimmerman were other leading candidates to be named captain. “A lot
                          of credit to my teammates,” Adams said, “because anyone throughout our leadership council can wear
                          that armband and represent us with pride and represent us in the right way." Adams debuted for the
                          Red Bulls in 2016 before moving to Europe in the winter of 2019, then to German Bundesliga side RB
                          Leipzig.

                          a match with Wales in the FIFA World Cup. DOHA, Qatar — The U.S. men's national team's first
                          appearance in the 2022 FIFA World Cup, a crucial opening match against Wales, has ended in a 1-1
                          tie, complicating U.S. hopes of emerging from the group stage. The outcome was something of a
                          disappointment after the U.S. had shown flashes of greatness in a dominant first half. The first
                          goal of the team's World Cup campaign came in the 36th minute, as U.S. winger Christian Pulisic fed
                          a breakaway ball to Timothy Weah, who flicked it in just ahead of the outstretched foot of Wales
                          keeper Wayne Hennessey as the U.S.-friendly crowd roared. The young U.S. squad controlled much of
                          the early game at Ahmad Bin Ali Stadium in Al Rayyan, besting Wales in time of possession.

                          Finance's company of the year for 2022 is Costco. I got a chance to sit down with Costco CEO Craig
                          Jelinek to take a look back at the company's performance this year. CRAIG JELINEK: Never gets old.
                          It never gets old. Now, I remember when we opened up the sixth location, we certainly didn't do
                          much volume. I think we had a $150,000 day. And normally, we do that in a lot of new openings every

                          It seemed poised to become the next Nike when it claimed the 2014 best-company title. But it missed
                          the athleisure trend, lost high-profile endorsers and endured management problems. The company's
                          value, meanwhile, has dropped from a peak of $22 billion in 2015 to less than $4 billion today.
                          Another disappointment: Facebook (META), our 2015 winner. In 2021, Yahoo Finance readers
                          face-palmed the company, now Meta, by voting it worst company of the year. What irked investors
                          then was a stream of controversy over Facebook allowing bogus content on the site and/or blocking
                          certain political points of view. This year’s woes include a wrong turn into the “metaverse,” where
                          nobody except CEO Mark Zuckerberg wants to hang out. The company laid off 11,000 workers in
                          November, and the stock is down 67% from its 2021 peak. Once a rare trillion-dollar company, Meta
                          is now worth less than $300 billion. Other Company of the Year setbacks? Square (SQ), our 2018
                          winner, began to focus on cryptocurrency a couple years later, eventually changing its name to
                          Block—as in blockchain. From 2020 to 2021, Square/Block rode the crypto boom up. Then, this year,
                          it rode the crypto bust right back down.

                          troubled union pension plan, preventing severe cuts to the retirement incomes of more than 350,000
                          Teamster workers and retirees across the United States. The money for the Central States Pension
                          Fund is the largest amount of federal aid provided for a pension plan, the Biden administration
                          said, and comes from the American Rescue Plan, a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package that he
                          signed into law in 2021. Many union retirement plans have been under financial pressure because of
                          underfunding and other issues. Without the federal assistance, Teamster members could have seen
                          their benefits reduced by an average of 60% starting within a couple of years.

                          Profile Sections tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News WASHINGTON — No one knows better that
                          elections have consequences than labor union leaders, who secured an $83 billion pension-fund
                          bailout in President Joe Biden's American Rescue Plan Act. "Without Joe Biden winning, and we won
                          the two Senate seats in Georgia and we were able to do reconciliation, none of this would’ve
                          happened," James P. Hoffa, the general president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters,
                          said in a telephone interview with NBC News. "The Republicans weren’t going to do it. The
                          Teamsters' Central States pension fund, covering nearly 400,000 workers and retirees, is the
                          marquee beneficiary of pension provisions attached to the larger relief bill. But labor leaders say
                          as many as 200 plans will be shored up, providing direct benefit to as many as 1.5 million people
                          in the short term, and many more overall. "That means the difference between eating and not eating,
                          and having a good retirement and one where you’re basically out there working trying to survive,"
                          Hoffa said. "The No. 1 priority, we've solved it." This account of the Teamsters' drive to save
                          retirement plans for millions of pensioners is drawn from interviews with several of the union's
                          officials, congressional sources and the public record. It begins with one Hoffa, the late
                          Teamsters chief James R. Hoffa, and the Central States pension fund he started.

Question 223              : Who won the Maxwell Award 2022 in college football?
Correct Answers         :  
                          Caleb Williams
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prediction (only positive):
  - Answer              : Caleb Williams
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          NCAAF 47 USC quarterback Caleb Williams won the 2022 Maxwell Award on Thursday, given to the best
                          player in college football. Here’s what you need to know: Williams was the best quarterback in
                          America this season, so the Maxwell Award was deserved. Williams led USC’s turnaround from a
                          four-win team to a top-10 squad in 2022 and elevated the players around him. Now his sights turn to
                          Saturday night and the Heisman Trophy. — Morales Duggan’s story has been one of the best in college
                          football, starting TCU’s season as the backup quarterback before leading the Horned Frogs to a 12-0
                          start. His toughness and perseverance helped pull the Frogs out of multiple second-half deficits
                          and without his poise, leadership and production late in games, TCU wouldn’t be in the College
                          Football Playoff. Winning the O’Brien and being a Heisman finalist are both well-deserved honors
                          for Duggan. — Khan Chuck Bednarik Award – Defensive Player of the Year Biletnikoff Award –

                          college football. The Maxwell Award has been presented to the College Player of the Year since 1937
                          and is named in honor of Robert “Tiny” Maxwell who was a former standout at the Swarthmore College
                          and a renowned sports writer and football official. The Maxwell Award watch list will once again
                          incorporate a broad spectrum of Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) programs and conferences from coast
                          to coast, led by Bryce Young (Alabama) who was the 2021 winner. Young is joined by 7 additional

                          Mordecai (SMU), Sean Tucker (Syracuse), Bijan Robinson (Texas), Brennen Armstrong (Virginia) and
                          Sam Hartman (Wake Forest). The full list consists of 85 players with Ohio State having 3 candidates
                          and an additional 14 schools having two players represented. Young joins A.J. McCarron, Derrick
                          Henry, Tua Tagovailoa and DeVonta Smith as the fifth Crimson Tide player to be selected as the
                          Maxwell Award winner.

Question 224              : Who is Africa's first World Cup semi-finalists
Correct Answers         :  
                          Morocco
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prediction (only positive):
  - Answer              : Spain
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          The 2010 FIFA World Cup, also branded as South Africa 2010, was the 19th FIFA World Cup, the world
                          championship for men's national football teams. It took place in South Africa from 11 June to 11
                          July 2010. The bidding process for hosting the tournament finals was open only to African nations.
                          In 2004, the international football federation, FIFA, selected South Africa over Egypt and Morocco
                          to become the first African nation to host the finals.[6] The matches were played in 10 stadiums in
                          nine host cities around the country,[7] with the opening and final played at the Soccer City
                          stadium in South Africa's largest city, Johannesburg.[8][9] Thirty-two teams were selected for
                          participation[10] via a worldwide qualification tournament that began in August 2007. In the first
                          round of the tournament finals, the teams competed in round-robin groups of four teams for points,
                          with the top two teams in each group proceeding. These 16 teams advanced to the knockout stage,
                          where three rounds of play decided which teams would participate in the final. In the final, Spain,
                          the European champions, defeated third-time losing finalists the Netherlands 1–0 after extra time
                          to win their first world title. Spain became the eighth nation to win the tournament and the first
                          European nation to win a World Cup hosted outside its home continent: all previous World Cups held
                          outside Europe had been won by South American nations.

                          So one reason Africa is yet to win a World Cup is that it has barely been participating. Some might
                          point to poor results in the last 12 years, but who is to say that increased participation would
                          not have led to increased competition and improvement? The prize money for simply participating in
                          the World Cup could have been injected into grassroots football around the continent, significantly
                          improving the quality of play. Nearly a century after the inaugural World Cup was hosted in
                          Uruguay, Africa will finally be awarded a more equitable number of places, when we will have 9.5
                          places in 2026 - inching us a bit closer to global parity. The 2022 World Cup has also shown us
                          that a lack of representation, not only in the form of qualification slots, but also in the form of
                          hosting rights, can be extremely influential. South Korea made the semi-finals in 2002 when they
                          co-hosted the tournament, while the Black Stars of Ghana were a penalty-kick away from the
                          semi-finals in 2010 in Africa's first World Cup in South Africa. Is it merely a coincidence that
                          Africa and Asia's best ever finishes came the only time the continents have hosted the tournaments?
                          The 2022 World Cup has shown us that the answer is: probably not. Three Asian sides qualified for
                          the knockout stages this year, and the Qatar World Cup has been, by far, the most successful
                          tournament ever on the pitch for African countries.

                          1990: Cameroon, 2002: Senegal, 2010: Ghana Three African teams have gone out in the quarter-finals
                          of the World Cup and all did so in painful fashion. Cameroon became the first African side to make
                          the last eight in Italy in 1990. They stunned defending champions Argentina in the tournament’s
                          opening game at the San Siro and that momentum saw them go on and top a group also containing
                          Romania and the Soviet Union. They then beat Colombia 2-1 in extra time in the round of 16, with a
                          38-year-old Milla scoring a brace to sink the South Americans. With the continent in dreamland, the
                          Indomitable Lions took on England in the quarter-finals. David Platt scored for England in the
                          first half, before Emmanuel Kunde equalised from the spot in the 61st minute. Four minutes later
                          Eugene Ekeke gave Cameroon the lead and the world was 25 minutes from a first African
                          semi-finalist. However, Gary Lineker equalised from the penalty spot and then won it in extra time
                          with another penalty. Cameroon were out but had taken a continent on the journey of a lifetime.
                          Advertisement Senegal followed in Cameroon’s footsteps in 2002 in South Korea and Japan — in more
                          ways than one. They beat the defending champions (France) in the tournament’s opening game on their
                          way to qualifying for the knockout stages.

                          13, 2022): Adam Sandler is set to receive the 2023 Mark Twain Prize for American Humor on March 19,
                          2023 in the Kennedy Center Concert Hall in Washington, D.C. Sandler, who was a cast member of NBC’s
                          Saturday Night Live from 1991 to 1995, is the seventh former cast member of that long-running show
                          to receive the honor, a sign of its profound influence on American comedy. He follows Billy
                          Crystal, Tina Fey, Will Ferrell, Eddie Murphy, Bill Murray and Julia Louis-Dreyfus. In addition,
                          Lorne Michaels, who created the show, received the honor in 2004. “Adam Sandler has entertained
                          audiences for over three decades with his films, music, and his tenure as a fan favorite cast
                          member on SNL,” Kennedy Center President Deborah F. Rutter said in a statement. “Adam has created
                          characters that have made us laugh, cry, and cry from laughing. I am looking forward to a
                          laughter-filled evening like no other as we celebrate his career at a ceremony that is sure to
                          bring together the best in comedy.” Over the past 30 years, Sandler has enjoyed success as a
                          comedian, actor, writer, producer, and musician. His films, including Grown Ups, Big Daddy, The
                          Longest Yard and The Waterboy, have grossed more than $3 billion worldwide.

                          The original conceptualization was an award which would celebrate one comedian, unlike the Kennedy
                          Center Honors which was more all-encompassing, and the venue would be the White House. They took
                          the idea to Ann Stock, then the White House social secretary. With the White House being an
                          inappropriate venue at the time, Kennedy Center was suggested. Bob Kaminsky, Peter Kaminsky and
                          Cappy McGarr were brought onboard and Comedy Central would coproduce and broadcast the show. At
                          this stage it was decided to name the prize after Mark Twain.[3] The inaugural recipient of the
                          award was Richard Pryor.[7] The first two years of the prize honoring Pryor and Jonathan Winters
                          were taped and broadcast on Comedy Central.[7] Since then, the award presentations have been taped
                          for broadcast on PBS.[8] In 2013 Carol Burnett was awarded, at age 80, while the youngest recipient
                          has been actress and comedian Tina Fey, at age 40 in 2010.[9][10][11] The Kennedy Center's intent
                          is to give the award to living persons, but one recipient, George Carlin, died in 2008 before
                          receiving his award. Carlin died five days after the official press release that he would be
                          awarded the prize.[12] Bill Cosby accepted his award at the Kennedy Center in 2009. He had twice
                          refused the honor, stating that he was disappointed with the profanity used in the inaugural
                          ceremony honoring Richard Pryor.

Question 228              : Who is the new president of the NCAA?
Correct Answers         :  
                          Charlie Baker
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prediction (only positive):
  - Answer              : Mark Emmert
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          The NCAA had four major priorities in it search for a new president to look after college
                          athletics. It wanted a former college athlete, an exec passionate about higher education, an
                          established corporate leader and a savvy politician who knows how to get things done in government.
                          The governing body found all of those traits and more in Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker, a former
                          Harvard basketball athlete and avid sports fan. The NCAA announced today that it has selected the
                          two-term governor to be its next president. Baker will replace outgoing NCAA President Mark Emmert
                          starting March 1. His second term as governor is slated to conclude Jan. 5; he announced about a
                          year ago that he wouldn’t seek a third term. Emmert will stay on as an adviser through June. The
                          NCAA’s choice of Baker, 66, signifies the association’s desire to have a leader who is well-versed
                          in the ways that Washington, D.C., works. With the NCAA facing so many legal and legislative
                          challenges, the board of governors, who made the hire, focused on someone from the political arena
                          early in the process and Baker emerged as the candidate with the experience and expertise to
                          navigate the governmental and athletic worlds that often collide in college sports. When asked why
                          he wanted the job, Baker replied, “Because it’s worth doing. Yeah, it’s big and complicated, but so
                          have been a lot of things in my life.“ Baker represents the first NCAA leader who doesn’t have a
                          background in college athletics or higher education.

Question 229              : who is the ceo of twitter?
Correct Answers         :  
                          Linda Yaccarino
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prediction (only positive):
  - Answer              : Linda Yaccarino
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          Copyright 2023 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. Elon Musk said Thursday he has found a
                          new CEO for Twitter, or X Corp. as it’s now called — and it’s a woman. He did not name her but said
                          she will be starting in about six weeks. In February, he told a conference he anticipated finding a
                          CEO for San Francisco-based Twitter “probably toward the end of this year.” (May 11) Elon Musk
                          confirmed that the new CEO for Twitter will be NBCUniversal’s Linda Yaccarino, an executive with
                          deep ties to the advertising industry. “I am excited to welcome Linda Yaccarino as the new CEO of
                          Twitter!” Musk wrote in a Friday tweet. He added that Yaccarino “will focus primarily on business
                          operations” while Musk will stay closely connected to product design and new technology. Before
                          that announcement, NBCUniversal said Friday that Yaccarino would step down immediately as
                          chairwoman for global advertising and partnerships. Musk, who bought Twitter last fall and has been
                          running it since, has long insisted that he would step down as top executive at the company, which
                          is now called X Corp. Few expect Musk to remove himself from the decision making process at
                          Twitter, however. “While he’s stepping back from the CEO title, Musk is far from likely to step
                          back from calling the product shots,” said Mike Proulx, research director at Forrester Research.

                          new CEO for X/Twitter. She will be starting in ~6 weeks!” Musk did not name Yaccarino in the
                          initial post, but on Friday, NBCUniversal, the entertainment conglomerate behind the NBC TV network
                          and the Universal film studio, announced that Yaccarino had left the business without revealing her
                          onward destination. Musk’s confirmation came soon afterwards. Yaccarino, whose official title at
                          NBCUniversal was chairman of global advertising and partnerships, is active on Twitter and has
                          almost 19,000 followers. Her most recent tweets focused largely on NBC programming and NBC’s
                          ad-supported Peacock streaming service, which she played a key role in launching. Excited to

                          on stage at an advertising conference in Miami last month, in which she told the Tesla CEO that
                          some advertisers “have a challenge with your points of view”, to which Musk replied that some of
                          his tweets should be taken with a “grain of salt”. Yaccarino also said in the interview: “If
                          freedom of speech, as he says, is the bedrock of this country, I’m not sure there’s anyone in this
                          room who could disagree with that.

                          Copyright 2023 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. Elon Musk said Thursday he has found a
                          new CEO for Twitter, or X Corp. as it’s now called — and it’s a woman. He did not name her but said
                          she will be starting in about six weeks. In February, he told a conference he anticipated finding a
                          CEO for San Francisco-based Twitter “probably toward the end of this year.” (May 11) Elon Musk
                          confirmed that the new CEO for Twitter will be NBCUniversal’s Linda Yaccarino, an executive with
                          deep ties to the advertising industry. “I am excited to welcome Linda Yaccarino as the new CEO of
                          Twitter!” Musk wrote in a Friday tweet. He added that Yaccarino “will focus primarily on business
                          operations” while Musk will stay closely connected to product design and new technology. Before
                          that announcement, NBCUniversal said Friday that Yaccarino would step down immediately as
                          chairwoman for global advertising and partnerships. Musk, who bought Twitter last fall and has been
                          running it since, has long insisted that he would step down as top executive at the company, which
                          is now called X Corp. Few expect Musk to remove himself from the decision making process at
                          Twitter, however. “While he’s stepping back from the CEO title, Musk is far from likely to step
                          back from calling the product shots,” said Mike Proulx, research director at Forrester Research.

Question 231              : How much did Avatar: The Way of Water earn in its debut weekend at U.S.?
Correct Answers         :

                          Next week sees the debut of Damien Chazelle’s “Babylon” and the family-friendly “Puss in Boots: The
                          Last Wish” but there are no comparable blockbusters until “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” in
                          February. The hope is that audiences will continue seeking “Avatar 2” out for weeks and months to
                          come, similar to the first movie. “Historically James Cameron’s movies are about the long haul, not
                          the opening weekend,” said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. “‘Avatar’ is
                          going to develop its box office over time. It’s about where it will end up months from now.”
                          Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to
                          Comscore, with Wednesday through Sunday in parentheses. Final domestic figures will be released
                          Monday. 1. “Avatar: The Way of Water,” $134 million. 2. “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,” $5.4
                          million. 3. “Violent Night,” $5 million. 4. “Strange World,” $2.2 million. 5. “The Menu,” $1.7
                          million. 6. “Devotion,” $825,000. 7. “The Fabelmans,” $750,000. 8. “Black Adam,” $500,000. 9. “I
                          Heard the Bells,” $308,893.

                          James Cameron’s highly anticipated Avatar: The Way of Water earned $53 million in its opening day
                          release in the U.S., almost double the opening day success of its blockbuster predecessor, although
                          it’s only the sixth-best film opening this year, and Cameron needs it to be a huge blockbuster to
                          justify its nine-figure budget. 'Avatar: The Way of Water' made $53 million in its opening day
                          release. The Disney and 20th Century Studios sequel to 2009’s Avatar—the highest-grossing film of
                          all time—opened in more than 4,200 theaters this weekend, collecting $17 million in Thursday
                          previews and another $36 million on Friday, Variety reported—nearly double the $26.7 million the
                          first Avatar made on its opening day. Deadline projects it to make between $130 million and $150
                          million domestically this weekend, short of the $150 million to $170 million it had been projected
                          to make. It falls short of the initial success of four Marvel and DC Comics sequels released
                          earlier this year: Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, which made $90.7 on its opening
                          day, as well as Black Panther: Wakanda Forever ($84.2 million), Thor: Love and Thunder ($69.5
                          million) and The Batman (56.6 million). It was also narrowly edged out by Jurassic World Dominion,
                          another sequel in the rebooted Jurassic Park franchise, which made $59.5 million on its opening day.

                          But for Cameron it’s all about the marathon, not the sprint. “The future of the Pandora isn’t going
                          to be determined this weekend,” Comscore senior media analyst Paul Dergarabedian said. “It’s going
                          to be determined over the next many weeks as the film plays, and we’ll have, I think, strong week
                          after week numbers.” The film might also be at the top of the list for viewers over the busy
                          holiday period, which also won’t include any major blockbuster competition, Dergarabedian noted.
                          However, the movie’s running time, 190 minutes, reduces the number of daily showings for theaters.
                          The film could be a turning point for the movie theater industry too, which had been decimated by
                          the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. The film’s success will also depend on whether audiences will
                          pay for the immersive 3D experience, which has decreased in popularity over time, along with
                          dwindling ticket sales. In 2009, “Avatar” earned $77 million in its opening weekend and collected
                          80% of its gross from 3D showings. That film revolutionized 3D viewing — and for its sequel,
                          premium formats such as IMAX and 3D accounted for 62% of the domestic box office haul.

                          Pinocchio" during the Oscars show at the 95th Academy Awards in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California,

                          Mexican filmmaker Guillermo del Toro's "Pinocchio" won the Academy Award for best animated feature
                          film on Sunday, the third Oscar of his career. The haunting stop-motion musical fantasy was
                          inspired by the 1883 Italian novel "The Adventures of Pinocchio" by Carlo Collodi, and informed by
                          Gris Grimly's illustrations of the 2002 edition of the book. Del Toro, 58, reimagines the classic
                          story of Pinocchio, a wooden puppet who dreams of being a real boy, who is cared for by carver
                          Geppetto. However, the story of the Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) film is set in Fascist Italy during the
                          interwar period and World War Two. "Pinocchio" prevailed over other popular nominees A24's
                          stop-motion film "Marcel the Shell With Shoes On" and the Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) 3D animated film
                          "Turning Red." Del Toro has many accolades, including his 2018 Oscar wins for best picture and best
                          director for "The Shape of Water.

                          Our planet has a strong gravitational connection with the Moon. But sometimes the gravity of the
                          Earth can also capture small asteroids, which then remain for a certain period of time, orbiting us
                          as a kind of temporary moon. This has happened at least twice this century: “mini-moons” have
                          remained in Earth’s orbit for several years or even less. But the newly discovered asteroid 2022 YG
                          has probably been trapped in gravity for several decades. An interesting space rock was first
                          observed on December 15, 2022. Interestingly, one of the first to notice it was amateur astronomer
                          Henadii Borisov from Crimea, also known for the discovery of the first known interstellar comet,
                          which now bears his name. Asteroid 2022 YG, as it is originally catalogued, has a diameter of 16-30
                          meters. Early computer models of its orbit showed that it completed a total orbit of the Earth in
                          one year. Moreover, this has been happening since about 1961. The simulation showed that the
                          quasi-moon will continue to orbit the Earth until 2181, when it can finally free itself from the
                          gravity of the Earth. Visualization of the orbital data for the year 2022 YG also shows that it
                          takes a strange path around our planet, stretching into an elongated ellipse in one direction, then
                          migrating back to a rounder orbit and stretching again in the other direction before the whole
                          cycle repeats.

                          the first game," Blake Pietila said. "We knew that we had to stick to our game plan tonight.
                          They're a fast transitioning team, so we had to stick to our D zone coverage like we've done all
                          year." Tech scored all of its goals in the opening period. Logan Pietila gave the Huskies the lead
                          7:06 into the game. Jed Pietila fed Logan backdoor through traffic, and he corralled the pass and
                          flipped in his fifth goal of the season.

                          competing against the Arizona State Sun Devils (10-11-0, 9-8-0 (1-3) Pairwise), Boston University
                          (12-5-0, 9-4-0 (3-1) Pairwise), and the United States Air Force Academy (6-10-2, 6-10-2 (0-0)
                          Pairwise). This week due to time constraints on my end, I will only be going in depth on the
                          MTU-ASU game but will give a quick lightning rough on the BU-AF game and the possible match ups for
                          day two. FREE STREAM LINK:
                          https://pac-12.com/arizona-state/schedule/network/live-stream/20221219-20230119 The last time these
                          two teams faced off was also the last time ASU managed to make a NCAA tournament bid. Since then,
                          the road for the Sun Devils has been rocky at best. This is their first season in their new hockey
                          arena aptly named “Mullet Arena”. While they may share it with the Arizona Coyotes for the next few
                          years, make no mistake, this is the Sun Devils arena first and the Coyotes second.

                          TEMPE, Arizona – No. 16 Michigan Tech won the 2023 Desert Hockey Classic with a 3-2 victory over
                          No. 6 Boston University Saturday at Mullett Arena. The Huskies jumped out to a 3-0 first-period
                          lead and held on for their third regular season tournament championship under Coach Shawhan. "It
                          was goaltending, goaltending, goaltending," said Shawhan. "Blake gave us a chance. We scored enough
                          in the first and held on. I couldn't be prouder of this group. They keep finding a way." Blake
                          Pietila was named tournament MVP after stopping 31 shots in the title game and 24 in the semifinal
                          win over the host Arizona State. "It feels good after coming off the GLI and our rough showing in
                          the first game," Blake Pietila said. "We knew that we had to stick to our game plan tonight.
                          They're a fast transitioning team, so we had to stick to our D zone coverage like we've done all
                          year." Tech scored all of its goals in the opening period. Logan Pietila gave the Huskies the lead
                          7:06 into the game. Jed Pietila fed Logan backdoor through traffic, and he corralled the pass and
                          flipped in his fifth goal of the season.

                          Moon heads to Netflix, here’s everything you need to know from its release date and trailer to
                          cast, plot, and more. Director Zack Snyder is known for his stint in the DCEU, with movies such as
                          Man of Steel, Batman v Superman, and Zack Snyder’s Justice League. Now, after leaving the DCEU
                          behind, Snyder has teamed up with Netflix for an assortment of projects, including Army of the Dead
                          and the forthcoming Rebel Moon. The movie has already drawn comparisons to that of the Star Wars
                          franchise and is shaping up to be one of 2023’s hottest blockbusters, and a major holiday hit for
                          the streaming platform. So, if you’re like us, you’ll want to be updated with all things Rebel

                          The two-part space epic began filming on April 19, 2022, and wrapped on December 2. Filmed
                          back-to-back, Zack Snyder’s foray into space warfare will also be released in theaters for a
                          limited time. Initially, the early concept for the film was pitched as an Akira Kurosawa-inspired
                          adventure to Star Wars executives during the prequel era, but ultimately transformed into the
                          Netflix space opera we know today.

                          Trending TV, movie and anime news, plus reviews and analysis. As Zack Snyder’s sci-fi epic Rebel
                          Moon heads to Netflix, here’s everything you need to know from its release date and trailer to
                          cast, plot, and more. Director Zack Snyder is known for his stint in the DCEU, with movies such as
                          Man of Steel, Batman v Superman, and Zack Snyder’s Justice League. Now, after leaving the DCEU
                          behind, Snyder has teamed up with Netflix for an assortment of projects, including Army of the Dead
                          and the forthcoming Rebel Moon. The movie has already drawn comparisons to that of the Star Wars
                          franchise and is shaping up to be one of 2023’s hottest blockbusters, and a major holiday hit for
                          the streaming platform. So, if you’re like us, you’ll want to be updated with all things Rebel
                          Moon. Here’s everything you need to know. Rebel Moon will premiere on Netflix on December 22, 2023.
                          The two-part space epic began filming on April 19, 2022, and wrapped on December 2. Filmed
                          back-to-back, Zack Snyder’s foray into space warfare will also be released in theaters for a
                          limited time. Initially, the early concept for the film was pitched as an Akira Kurosawa-inspired
                          adventure to Star Wars executives during the prequel era, but ultimately transformed into the
                          Netflix space opera we know today.

Question 241              : What was the annual GDP growth rate of the U.S. economy in 2022?
Correct Answers         :  
                          2.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prediction (only positive):

  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          7 percent in the third quarter. GDP for 2022 Real GDP increased 2.1 percent in 2022 (from the 2021
                          annual level to the 2022 annual level), compared with an increase of 5.9 percent in 2021 (table 1).
                          The increase in real GDP in 2022 primarily reflected increases in consumer spending, exports,
                          private inventory investment, and nonresidential fixed investment that were partly offset by
                          decreases in residential fixed investment and federal government spending. Imports increased (table
                          2). The increase in consumer spending reflected an increase in services that was partly offset by a
                          decrease in goods. Within services, the increase was led by "other" services (mainly international
                          travel), food services and accommodations, and health care. The decrease in goods primarily
                          reflected decreases in food and beverages as well as motor vehicles and parts that were partly
                          offset by increases in recreational goods and vehicles and "other" nondurable goods (mainly
                          pharmaceuticals). The increase in exports reflected increases in both goods and services. The
                          increase in private inventory investment primarily reflected increases in manufacturing, wholesale
                          trade, and retail trade industries. The increase in nonresidential fixed investment reflected
                          increases in intellectual property products (led by software) and in equipment (led by information
                          processing equipment) that were partly offset by a decrease in structures (led by commercial and
                          health care as well as power and communication structures).

                          February 23, 2023. The increase in real GDP reflected increases in private inventory investment,
                          consumer spending, federal government spending, state and local government spending, and
                          nonresidential fixed investment that were partly offset by decreases in residential fixed
                          investment and exports. Imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, decreased
                          (table 2). The increase in private inventory investment was led by manufacturing (mainly petroleum
                          and coal products as well as chemicals) as well as mining, utilities, and construction industries
                          (led by utilities). The increase in consumer spending reflected increases in both services and
                          goods. Within services, the increase was led by health care, housing and utilities, and "other"
                          services (notably, personal care services). Within goods, the leading contributor was motor
                          vehicles and parts.

                          the target range for the federal funds rate in 2022 and 2023. In CBO’s projections, the interest
                          rate on 3-month Treasury bills rises in concert with that increase. The interest rate on 10-year
                          Treasury notes is expected to increase through 2028, in part because short-term interest rates are
                          expected to rise. Data sources: Congressional Budget Office; Bureau of Economic Analysis; Federal

                          Related: Shazam! Big Screen History, Explained Billy Batson is played by Asher Angel while the
                          superhero adult form of Shazam is played by Zachary Levi. The character wears his comic book
                          character's signature red outfit with a white cape and lightning bolt on his chest. Shazam,
                          originally named Captain Marvel, was at one point the most popular superhero in the world and even
                          outsold Superman comics. The character has the potential to be a major part of the DCU; if the
                          sequel does well, there's little doubt he can fit him into James Gunn and Peter Safran's new plans
                          for the franchise. Freddy Freeman is Billy's physically disabled foster brother and also the first
                          person to learn that Billy has superpowers. Freddy is an expert on all things superheroes and helps
                          Billy learn more about his powers. Freddy Freeman's adult form, formerly known as Captain Marvel
                          Jr. in the comics, wears a blue super suit and has a great deal of flight power, which is fitting
                          because that was the superpower he told Billy he wished he could have. One of the most courageous
                          members of the group (representing Achilles), his kid form is played by Jack Dylan Grazer, while
                          his adult form is played by Adam Brody. A notable thing about Freddy Freeman is, while originally
                          under the name Captain Marvel Jr., was the favorite superhero of rock icon Elvis Presley.

                          Related: Shazam! Big Screen History, Explained Billy Batson is played by Asher Angel while the
                          superhero adult form of Shazam is played by Zachary Levi. The character wears his comic book
                          character's signature red outfit with a white cape and lightning bolt on his chest. Shazam,
                          originally named Captain Marvel, was at one point the most popular superhero in the world and even
                          outsold Superman comics. The character has the potential to be a major part of the DCU; if the
                          sequel does well, there's little doubt he can fit him into James Gunn and Peter Safran's new plans
                          for the franchise. Freddy Freeman is Billy's physically disabled foster brother and also the first
                          person to learn that Billy has superpowers. Freddy is an expert on all things superheroes and helps
                          Billy learn more about his powers. Freddy Freeman's adult form, formerly known as Captain Marvel
                          Jr. in the comics, wears a blue super suit and has a great deal of flight power, which is fitting
                          because that was the superpower he told Billy he wished he could have. One of the most courageous
                          members of the group (representing Achilles), his kid form is played by Jack Dylan Grazer, while
                          his adult form is played by Adam Brody. A notable thing about Freddy Freeman is, while originally
                          under the name Captain Marvel Jr., was the favorite superhero of rock icon Elvis Presley.

                          TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew will testify for his first congressional hearing on Thursday, where he is
                          likely to face intense grilling from politicians from both parties who argue that the popular app,
                          which has 150 million U.S. users, cannot be trusted. Here’s a quick guide for what to know about
                          Chew, a 40-year-old Singaporean who interned at Facebook and studied at Harvard Business School
                          before becoming the public face of one of the most popular — and contentious — apps in the United
                          States. TikTok's CEO testifies before Congress. Follow our live updates. Chew was born and raised
                          in Singapore, the island nation in Southeast Asia that has become a prominent bridge for
                          international business between China and the West. “The thing about growing up on a small island …
                          is you get wanderlust at a very young age,” he said in an interview last year. After completing his
                          military service — mandatory for most male Singaporeans — he left to study economics at University
                          College London (UCL), a top British university, graduating in 2006 and working at investment bank
                          Goldman Sachs for two years. He then moved to the United States to get his master’s degree at
                          Harvard Business School. “I remember struggling with this decision,” he said in a speech to UCL
                          graduates in 2022, as he was unsure whether taking time to do the master’s degree “would enhance or
                          delay my career.

                          Bruising, damaging, relentless. TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew faced four-and-a-half hours of questioning
                          at a US congressional hearing on Thursday. As one congressman pointed out, some people run
                          marathons quicker than that. Mr Chew will certainly be feeling it, after a torrid time giving
                          evidence. Many tech execs have stood before Congress, and they often don't get an easy ride. But
                          what was exceptional about this hearing was the stubborn, never-ending line of vicious questioning.
                          From both Democrats and Republicans, there was no let-up. A spokesperson for TikTok said afterwards
                          the politicians were "grandstanding". There is most certainly some truth to that. But between the
                          sometimes frustratingly verbose questioning, we did learn a thing or two. There was criticism of
                          TikTok from Republicans and Democrats, and the level of distrust and scepticism from all sides was
                          stark. "Welcome to the most bipartisan committee in Congress," said Republican congressman Buddy

                          was really quite something to see so many politicians - who agree on practically nothing - agreeing
                          wholeheartedly that TikTok was a security threat.

                          Unfortunately for the show, that unexpected nature can be a double-edged sword regarding AI trained
                          on data scraped from the Internet. According to Vice, late Sunday night, the AI-generated clone of
                          Jerry Seinfeld (called "Larry Feinberg" in the AI show) went on a brief transphobic rant. Here's a
                          transcript: There’s like 50 people here and no one is laughing. Anyone have any suggestions? I’m
                          thinking about doing a bit about how being transgender is actually a mental illness. Or how all
                          liberals are secretly gay and want to impose their will on everyone. Or something about how
                          transgender people are ruining the fabric of society. But no one is laughing, so I’m going to stop.
                          Thanks for coming out tonight. See you next time. Where’d everybody go? In a Discord post from the
                          channel's creators, the malfunction occurred because of an outage from OpenAI's higher-cost (and
                          better-behaved) text-davinci-003 model led the creators to fall back to the lower-cost (and less
                          complex) text-curie-001 model to keep the show running. "The switch to Curie was what resulted in
                          the inappropriate text being generated," wrote an admin on the show's Discord channel. "We leverage
                          OpenAI’s content moderation tools, which have worked thus far for the Davinci model, but were not

  - Source              :
                          Ron Robinson, Iowa’s Legislative Service Agency specialist on the bill, said that in order to apply
                          for one of the vouchers, a student’s family must be 400 percent below poverty level, or have an
                          Individualized Education Plan. To pay for this, $55.2 million would be moved from Iowa’s general
                          fund — the state’s main operating fund. Each student who uses a voucher would receive roughly
                          $5,500, which is 70 percent of that state’s per pupil allocation, Robinson said. The bill passed
                          the Iowa Senate 31-18 on March 30 and has moved to the House. We cannot gauge whether “the rest of
                          Iowa kids in public schools would end up losing opportunities,” because that is a prediction. But
                          Robinson confirmed Konfrst’s statement that 2 percent of Iowa’s K-12 children will have a chance at
                          vouchers. Only 10,000 vouchers would be available for about 485,000 school children in Iowa, he
                          said. However, other student funding generated from taxes and federal funds will remain in the
                          district that the student leaves. According to the governor’s fact sheet, public schools will
                          retain roughly $1,400 per pupil in property tax dollars for each student from that particular
                          school district who uses a voucher to attend a private school. After the Senate vote, Gov. Kim
                          Reynolds sent a news release that said the state should create opportunities for more families to
                          provide their children with the education choice best for them.

  - Source              :
                          On its surface, Bard looks a lot like ChatGPT, the AI bot from research lab OpenAI that went viral
                          late last year and got a big update last week. Millions of people have tried that AI, and it has
                          been integrated into Microsoft’s Bing search engine and Snapchat’s My AI virtual friend. ChatGPT is
                          also notorious for sometimes going off the rails on weird tangents. Google brings several
                          advantages to the AI race. It has spent years developing its underlying chatbot technology called
                          LaMDA, short for Language Model for Dialogue Applications. This is far-out stuff: Last year, Google
                          fired an engineer for publicly claiming LaMDA was sentient. Google says no, its AI is actually just
                          a “prediction engine,” or a very fancy version of auto-complete. It responds to a prompt by
                          selecting, one word at a time, the words that are likely to come next. Google describes Bard as a
                          “creative collaborator” that can help boost productivity and accelerate ideas. That’s a pretty

Question 250              : who founded midjourney?

                          As the technology goes mainstream, though, one company will be able to take some credit for its
                          ascendancy: a 10-person research lab named Midjourney, which makes an eponymous AI image generator
                          accessed through a Discord chat server. Although the name might be unfamiliar, you’ve probably seen
                          the output from Midjourney’s system floating about your social media feeds already. To generate
                          your own, you just join Midjourney’s Discord, type a prompt, and the system makes an image for you.
                          Midjourney exists on Discord because “people want to make things together” “A lot of people ask us,
                          why don’t you just make an iOS app that makes you a picture?” Midjourney’s founder, David Holz,
                          told The Verge in an interview. “But people want to make things together, and if you do that on
                          iOS, you have to make your own social network. And that’s pretty hard. So if you want your own
                          social experience, Discord is really great.” Sign up for a free account, and you get 25 credits,
                          with all images generated in public chatrooms. After that, you’ll have to pay — either $10 or $30 a
                          month, depending on the number of images you want to make and whether or not they’re private to
                          you. This week, though, Midjourney is expanding access to its model, allowing anyone to create
                          their own Discord server with their own AI image generator.

                          “Our technology is moving so fast that it makes sense to focus on the consumer side because that’s
                          where people can just take things and run. Also, there’s something very simple and beautiful about
                          making a cool thing,” Holz said. “It only gets better when regular people can pay and have fun with
                          it while professionals pay less than they would for an enterprise product, and still enjoy the
                          product and use it for work. I think this simplicity is worth a lot and we want to keep it.” While
                          the world believes that the next phase of text-to-image evolution will move towardfull-blown videos
                          or movies, Midjourney begs to differ. In fact, the company might avoid that as much as possible —
                          as incorporating text-to-video capabilities could make the product more expensive and the output
                          could be a dealbreaker, if it’s not thoroughly thought through. That said, Holz does plan to take
                          things to the next level via text-to-3D. He detailed Midjourney’s quest to make the output more
                          real and move towards augmented and virtual reality. It aspires to bring the liquid imagination to
                          the real world. “I care about three things: Reflection, coordination and imagination. To make a
                          better world, we need to be more reflective, more imaginative and we need to be better at
                          coordinating. And I want to build something big in each area, and then bring them together one
                          day,” he said.

                          commerce and payments," Silbermann said in a statement. Silbermann, who co-founded the company in
                          2010 and took it public in April 2019, will serve as the company's first Executive Chairman.
                          Silbermann faced challenges ranging from missed quarterly user expectations to a series of

                          discrimination and retaliation became the basis of a California workforce non-disclosure law. "As

Question 253              : What is the release date for Pikmin 4 on Nintendo Switch?

                          Pikmin 4 is so close to lanching on the Nintendo Switch, and here's when fans can expect to jump
                          into the digital version. Pikmin 4 is set to launch for the Nintendo Switch on July 21 and marks
                          the newest numbered entry in the real-time strategy series in over ten years, making its release
                          quite the big deal for hardcore fans. Instead of playing as Captain Olimar (who most people know
                          from Super Smash Bros. at this point) or any of his space explorer comrades, gamers will get to
                          customize their own character (a series first). There are not too many options available, but it's
                          still a step forward in terms of a character creator in a Nintendo first-party title. Pikmin 4
                          comes out in a couple of days and retails for $59.99, the same price as most other major games on
                          the Switch. People who decided to pre-order the game digitally via the Switch eShop are probably

                          Pikmin 4 is so close to lanching on the Nintendo Switch, and here's when fans can expect to jump
                          into the digital version. Pikmin 4 is set to launch for the Nintendo Switch on July 21 and marks
                          the newest numbered entry in the real-time strategy series in over ten years, making its release
                          quite the big deal for hardcore fans. Instead of playing as Captain Olimar (who most people know
                          from Super Smash Bros. at this point) or any of his space explorer comrades, gamers will get to
                          customize their own character (a series first). There are not too many options available, but it's
                          still a step forward in terms of a character creator in a Nintendo first-party title. Pikmin 4
                          comes out in a couple of days and retails for $59.99, the same price as most other major games on
                          the Switch. People who decided to pre-order the game digitally via the Switch eShop are probably

                          roles that it hasn’t yet filled. In a nod to continued economic uncertainty, Zuckerberg noted that

                          total expenses in 2023, from $86 billion to $92 billion. The new round of layoffs follow a round of
                          cuts announced in November that affected over 11,000 workers, which equated to roughly 13% of
                          Meta’s overall staff. Zuckerberg has pitched 2023 as the company’s “year of efficiency,” in which

Question 255              : What company acquired iRobot?

                          LuckyStep - stock.adobe.com More than 20 civil rights and data privacy organizations sent a letter
                          Friday to the Federal Trade Commission asking the agency to challenge Amazon's acquisition of
                          iRobot, calling it a privacy and competition threat. Amazon entered into a definitive merger
                          agreement last month to acquire iRobot, maker of the popular Roomba vacuum cleaner. But privacy
                          advocates worry that Amazon will use this product to vacuum up information about consumer homes and
                          private lives. "Allowing Amazon to absorb a competing smart home device business with access to
                          incredibly detailed consumer data would endanger fair competition and open markets while also
                          jeopardizing consumer privacy," according to the letter. The FTC is reportedly looking into
                          Amazon's iRobot acquisition. Acquiring iRobot could provide Amazon with a significant amount of
                          consumer data, said Gartner analyst Bill Ray. Roomba vacuums provide details such as room layouts,
                          the number of rooms in a house and furniture placement. "The size of your rooms, the thickness of
                          your carpet -- that sort of information is very useful," Ray said. "You can tell a lot about a
                          person by that kind of thing." Amazon already knows a significant portion of its customers have
                          more than one Alexa product, with the kitchen being the most popular location, Ray said. With the
                          acquisition of iRobot, its vacuum products could be used to glean information about a consumer
                          home, including which rooms include Alexa products, he said.

                          Super Bowl LVII was an American football game played to determine the champion of the National
                          Football League (NFL) for the 2022 season. The American Football Conference (AFC) champion Kansas
                          City Chiefs defeated the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Philadelphia Eagles, 38–35.
                          The game was played on February 12, 2023, at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. It was the
                          fourth Super Bowl hosted by the Phoenix metropolitan area, and the third at this venue, with the
                          most recent previously being Super Bowl XLIX in 2015 (then known as University of Phoenix
                          Stadium).[6] Both teams finished the regular season with a league-best 14–3 record. This was the
                          Eagles fourth Super Bowl appearance overall and the second in the last six seasons, having
                          previously won Super Bowl LII; the Eagles previously lost Super Bowls XV and XXXIX. This was the
                          Chiefs' fifth Super Bowl appearance overall and third in the last four seasons, having previously
                          won Super Bowls IV and LIV, and losses in Super Bowls I and LV. After the Eagles went into halftime
                          up 24–14, the Chiefs mounted a comeback to win the game 38–35 with a game-winning field goal kicked
                          by Harrison Butker. Butker's game winning kick was set up by a pivotal and controversial defensive
                          holding call on Philadelphia cornerback James Bradberry, which was criticized by some observers but
                          supported by others.

                          week leading up to the game. The Chiefs also practiced at Arizona State University in Tempe.[51]
                          The game was informally referred to as the "Andy Reid Bowl", as Chiefs head coach Andy Reid had
                          previously served as the head coach of the Eagles from 1999 to 2012.[52][53] Reid became the fifth
                          head coach to face his former team in the Super Bowl, joining Weeb Ewbank (Super Bowl III), Dan
                          Reeves (XXXIII), Jon Gruden (XXXVII), and Pete Carroll (XLIX).[54] The game was also referred to as
                          the "Kelce Bowl",[55][56][57] as this marked the first Super Bowl to feature brothers playing
                          against each other: Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce and Eagles center Jason Kelce.[55][58] The game
                          was the first Super Bowl between two black starting quarterbacks: Patrick Mahomes of the Chiefs and
                          Jalen Hurts of the Eagles.[59][60] Mahomes (27 years of age) and Hurts (24) were the youngest
                          starting quarterback pair in Super Bowl history.[61] Super Bowl LVII was televised by Fox and Fox
                          Deportes.[62] It marked the final game to be broadcast under the current NFL television contract.

                          in the world, BTS. HYBE (Big Hit Ent.) was founded in February 2005, and signed its first band,

                          launching artists in the first gen of K-pop, and soon found success with the hip-hop group 1TYM.
                          YG's success chart kept rising for the next few years until 2018, when their stock price plummeted
                          due to various scandals. The company, however, is getting back on track with its artists like
                          BLACKPINK, Winner, BIG BANG, iKon, Sechs Kies, Treasure, and many others. The label also manages
                          soloists, actors, and artists under its subsidiaries. Also known for producing royal girl groups,
                          JYP Entertainment has maintained its position in the top three list of the richest K-pop companies
                          in 2022. The label currently holds a market capital of $1.56 billion, and is taking flight with
                          successful artists like TWICE, Stray Kids, 2PM, ITZY, and former boy group, GOT7.

                          standing ovation as he fought back tears. “Mom, I just won an Oscar!” said Quan, 51, whose family
                          fled Vietnam in the war when he was a child. “They say stories like this only happen in the movies.
                          I can’t believe it’s happening,” said Quan. “This is the American dream.” Minutes later, Quan’s

                          Blanchett, Michelle Williams, Judd Hirsch and Angela Bassett have been nominated before. Only
                          Blanchett has ever won (twice). The flood of newcomers includes the entire best actor field —
                          Austin Butler for Elvis, Colin Farrell for The Banshees of Inisherin, Brendan Fraser for The Whale,
                          Bill Nighy for Living, and Paul Mescal for Aftersun. Butler and Fraser have won most of the
                          so-called precursor awards; Butler won the Golden Globe, Fraser won the Screen Actors Guild Award.
                          There are new nominees who have been around for long enough that their lack of prior nominations
                          feels surprising, like Nighy or Jamie Lee Curtis. But there are also some who are much newer to the
                          scene, like Butler and Stephanie Hsu. And, too, there are comeback stories in both Fraser and Ke
                          Huy Quan, who have both been welcomed as evidence that perseverance can work, even in a punishing

                          the entertainment industry, which started 30 years ago, he added, "Things -- they didn't come
                          easily to me, but there was a facility that I didn't appreciate at the time until it stopped."

                          the Oscars. Four Oscar nominations for Asian performers in a single year is a record. Three of them
                          – Michelle Yeoh, who is competing for best actress, Ke Huy Quan (best supporting actor) and

                          the best friend of Brendan Fraser's title character in The Whale. While there are also Asian
                          directors and screenwriters among this year’s nominees, in other respects, 2023 represents a step
                          back from diversity for the Motion Picture Academy. With no Black actors nominated for lead
                          performances and no women feature directors nominated, there are still areas of the multiverse that
                          need exploring. Check out our interviews with Ke Huy Quan and Michelle Yeoh and read more about

                          On the morning of the ceremony, however, it was reported that Gaga would perform at the
                          ceremony.[36] Meanwhile, actress Glenn Close, who was originally scheduled as a presenter during
                          the gala, canceled her appearance due to a positive COVID-19 test.[37] When the nominations were
                          announced, nine of the ten films nominated for Best Picture had earned a combined gross of $1.57
                          billion at the American and Canadian box offices at the time. Top Gun: Maverick was the
                          highest-grossing film among the Best Picture nominees with $718.7 million in domestic box office
                          receipts.[38] Avatar: The Way of Water came in second with $598.4 million; this was followed by
                          Elvis ($151 million), Everything Everywhere All at Once ($70 million), The Fabelmans ($15 million),
                          The Banshees of Inisherin ($9 million), Tar ($5.6 million), Triangle of Sadness ($4.2 million), and
                          Women Talking ($1.1 million). The box office figures for All Quiet on the Western Front were
                          unavailable due to their distributor Netflix's policy of refusing to release such figures.[39]
                          Furthermore, by virtue of Avatar: The Way of Water and Top Gun: Maverick's Best Picture
                          nominations, it marked the first time since the 55th ceremony in 1983 that the two highest grossing
                          films of the year were both nominated in the aforementioned category.[40]

                          content, decent channel count, and reasonable price. Check out our Best Live TV Streaming Services

                          entertainment, sports, and news channels doesn’t look much different than a basic cable
                          package—until you notice the lack of filler. There’s no cable-package bloat like audio-only music
                          or shopping networks (except for QVC), just a tight lineup of popular channels like Comedy Central,
                          Paramount Network, MTV, AMC, Cartoon Network, ESPN, Disney Channel, FS1, FX, Syfy, TNT, USA
                          Network, etc. YouTube TV trims the cable fat nicely.

Question 269              : What is the name of Elon Musk's new AI company?
Correct Answers         :  
                          X.AI, xAI
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prediction (only positive):
  - Answer              : X.AI
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          By Jay Peters and Emma Roth Elon Musk has created a new company dedicated to artificial
                          intelligence — and it’s called X.AI, as first reported by The Wall Street Journal. The company,
                          which a Nevada filing indicates was incorporated last month, currently has Musk as its director and
                          Jared Birchall, the director of Musk’s family office, listed as its secretary. The filing, which
                          The Verge has also obtained, indicates that Musk incorporated the business on March 9th, 2023.
                          Rumors about Musk starting up an AI company have been floating around for days, with a report from
                          Business Insider revealing that Musk had purchased thousands of graphic processing units (GPUs) to
                          power an upcoming generative AI product. The Financial Times similarly reported that Musk planned
                          to create an AI firm to compete with the Microsoft-backed OpenAI. Musk even reportedly sought
                          funding from SpaceX and Tesla investors to get the company started. During an interview on Twitter
                          Spaces, when Musk was asked about all the GPUs he purchased, the billionaire made no mention of his
                          plans to build an AI company, stating “it seems like everyone and their dog is buying GPUs at this
                          point.” The purported X.AI name matches the branding of the X Corp. name he has since assigned to
                          Twitter, along with the “X” label he’s applied to his vision of an “everything app.

  - Source              :
                          was dissolved as a company this week and was replaced by a new company Musk calls X. The move is
                          seen as an attempt to build a social media platform that also allows payments, turning it into “the
                          everything app,” akin to how apps like WeChat work in China. Twitter announced this week it was
                          partnering with eToro to allow users to be able to trade stocks and crypto. It should be pretty
                          clear by now that Musk’s call for a six-month pause was purely out of self interest in the AI arms
                          race, as I wrote at the time. ChatGPT has become a fascinating tool for people who want to
                          experiment with large language models (LLMs) that answer questions posed in natural language. But
                          there are still a lot of kinks to be worked out, as ChatGPT will often give confident answers, even
                          when it’s wrong. AI is largely a magic trick at this point, sometimes spouting nonsense that users
                          may not know enough about to fact-check. But it’s an interesting magic trick and it’s something
                          that will improved upon as more people in the world of tech become involved. Musk must know he’s
                          behind in the most exciting development on the web since social media went mainstream in the late
                          2000s. But the billionaire clearly doesn’t intend to stay behind for long.

                          Filed under: It’s the middle of April, the big Hokie Hi weekend has passed, and the biggest of the
                          big campus celebration events was the Spring Football Game. There were lots of things to look at
                          and analyze but for now, here are some shots and comments from the game. GO HOKIES!!! The crowd was
                          easily over 20,000 people. Hokie Hi weekend featured Friday and Saturday celebrations with an
                          evening tribute to the fallen 32 from April 16th 2007. The morning on Saturday was the 3.2 mile Run
                          and Walk for Remembrance, and the crowd there was estimated to be 15,000 or so. The weather in
                          Blacksburg not only cooperated, it assisted by being comfortably warm, without being hot, and a
                          light breeze was blowing. It was a magnificent way to honor the fallen and celebrate their memories
                          as Hokies. The Maroon Squad Offense was obviously mostly #1s int he depth chart, with Grant Wells
                          starting at Maroon Squad QB. He’d remain there for the first half. We’ll talk about the various
                          observations in a coming article, but overall, he did well and seemed like he was much more
                          comfortable than he was last season. We’ll take that as a major plus, for now.

                          collaborative blog for teachers to track the good things happening in their classrooms. She credits
                          daily posting there to helping her recognize the beautiful and positive experiences occurring in
                          her classroom, which inspired her to stay in the profession. She has since contributed 1,400 posts
                          to the blog. As Oklahoma Teacher of the Year, she has visited teachers across the state to
                          highlight their important work through the Teachers of Oklahoma campaign.

                          State chiefs recognize that setting clear expectations for academic excellence is critical for
                          student success For all to mean all, it has to mean each. CCSSO supports states in encouraging
                          innovation, learning from other sectors, and applying new principles to transform the educational
                          landscape. As the national voice of every state education leader, we advocate for the development
                          and implementation of effective policies. Published: Author: Washington, D.C. (April 19, 2023) –
                          The Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO) today announced that Rebecka Peterson, a high
                          school math teacher, is the 2023 National Teacher of the Year. Peterson has taught high school math
                          classes ranging from intermediate algebra to Advanced Placement calculus for 11 years at Union High
                          School in Tulsa, Oklahoma. A proud immigrant of Swedish-Iranian descent, Peterson is passionate
                          about making mathematics engaging, relevant and accessible to all students, no matter their
                          background. Amid a difficult first year of high school teaching, she found “One Good Thing,” a
                          collaborative blog for teachers to track the good things happening in their classrooms. She credits
                          daily posting there to helping her recognize the beautiful and positive experiences occurring in
                          her classroom, which inspired her to stay in the profession. She has since contributed 1,400 posts
                          to the blog. As Oklahoma Teacher of the Year, she has visited teachers across the state to
                          highlight their important work through the Teachers of Oklahoma campaign.

                          [79] CNET has reported that the "Apple retail experience hurts Best Buy" and noted, "Buy a MacBook
                          at the Apple Store and it's hard to go back to the Best Buy Windows laptop buying experience". The
                          publication also wrote that "Apple salespeople are generally more knowledgeable, the products
                          themselves are generally higher quality, and the stores are more appealing, aesthetically and
                          practically."[80] In October 2009, reports surfaced that Steve Jobs and his retail team would help
                          "drastically overhaul" Disney Stores. His involvement was described by The New York Times as
                          "particularly notable", given his work on the "highly successful" Apple Stores and his election to
                          Disney's board of directors in 2006.[81][82] In August 2009, the London Evening Standard reported
                          that Apple's first store in the United Kingdom, at Regent Street, was the most profitable shop of
                          its size in London, with the highest sales per square foot, taking in £60 million a year, or £2,000
                          per square foot.[83] Many other electronics retailers from around the world such as Huawei,
                          Samsung, Xiaomi started to follow the designing trend of Apple Store.[citation needed] In May 2016,
                          Apple significantly redesigned its Union Square Apple Store in downtown San Francisco, adding large
                          glass doors for the entry, open spaces with touch-sensitive tables and shelves for product
                          displays, and rebranded rooms for the store.

Question 275              : What was Sundar Pichai's total compensation in 2022?
Correct Answers         :  
                          226 million

  - Answer              : $226 million
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          Sundar Pichai, chief executive of Alphabet Inc. and Google, was awarded compensation in 2022 valued
                          at $226 million, according to a regulatory filing Friday, including stock awards valued at more
                          than $200 million. In 2019, the last year his compensation included a triannual stock grant, his
                          compensation was valued at $281 million. Mr. Pichai said in January that top executives would get
                          lower bonuses as part of cost-cutting measures, following the largest round of layoffs in the
                          company’s history. Last month, Google’s finance chief told employees to expect more spending cuts.
                          Mr. Pichai’s annual salary for 2020-2022 was $2 million, Friday’s filing shows. In December, the
                          company granted a new triannual equity award to Mr. Pichai with a value of $210 million, according
                          to a regulatory filing, consisting of both performance-based and time-based equity. That grant
                          contains two tranches of performance stock units with a target value of $63 million each, plus a
                          grant of $84 million in the form of Alphabet’s restricted stock units. Alphabet said in the filing
                          that more of the latest stock award would be dependent on performance over time, increasing the
                          proportion of performance stock units to 60% of the total from 43% in 2019. Download the Mint app

                          So, so much AI Google I/O 2023 was held on May 10. While many of the talks and presentations at I/O
                          are developer focused, the event started, as always, with a flashy keynote address to let us all
                          know what Google's been up to lately. This year, that includes both hardware and software — and, as
                          you might imagine, lots and lots of talk about AI. Here's everything you need to know. At I/O,
                          Google not only fully revealed its next midrange phone, the Pixel 7a, but also surprise-announced
                          that the phone is available to purchase — not preorder — right now, for $499. The phone shares a
                          lot of DNA with the $600 Pixel 7, including its Tensor G2 chipset, eight gigs of RAM, and design,
                          which is nearly indistinguishable from its more expensive cousin. If you're interested to learn
                          more, we've got a full review for you to check out. Interestingly, the Pixel 6a will remain on
                          offer at a lower price point: $350. As anticipated, Google showed off its first foldable at I/O
                          this year. The Pixel Fold's got a refreshingly normal-looking 5.8" screen on the outside and a 7.6"
                          display (with some pretty substantial bezels) on the inside.

                          sporting director U.S. Soccer has long been accused of failing to marshal the full scale of the
                          sport’s diversity in the country. Crocker will have a big role in doing something about that, since
                          he’ll oversee all U.S. national teams — men’s and women’s, superstars and youth teams,
                          paralympians, and teams that play on grass, beaches, and indoor futsal courts. Of particular
                          interest is his role in recruiting multinational athletes with ties to America and other countries.
                          The U.S. program has gotten good at that in recent years, earning commitments from Yunus Musah,

                          English-Nigerian-American striker Folarin Balogun, is on the horizon now. Will Crocker take the

                          The United States Soccer Federation is searching for a new sporting director to oversee its men’s
                          and women’s national teams following the sudden and unexpected departure of Earnie Stewart, who had
                          held the job since 2019. U.S. Soccer announced Thursday that Stewart will leave his post on Feb. 15
                          to take on a similar role with club side PSV Eindhoven in his native Netherlands. The USSF also
                          confirmed reports by FOX Sports and others that men’s national team general manager Brian McBride
                          is out, too. The twin moves have all sorts of implications for the federation, particularly as it
                          relates to the vacant USMNT coaching job. Here are four key questions for the fed following the
                          news. Who replaces Earnie Stewart, Brian McBride? On a conference call with reporters on Thursday,
                          USSF president Cindy Parlow Cone indicated that McBride’s position might not be filled at all.
                          "We're going to evaluate the entire sporting department, and that includes the [men’s] GM role,"
                          Parlow Cone said. "We're not dead set on having the exact same structure on the men's side as we do
                          have on the women's side, and we're going to be evaluating that and seeing what changes we need to
                          make." When it comes to Stewart’s replacement, there are few obvious candidates.

                          lately, she's been seeing this guy. CHANG: I mean, he's really hot. He's a doctor. He has a really
                          great relationship with his mother, Raheela. So everyone is thrilled when he and Lena get engaged -
                          that is, everyone except Ria. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, "POLITE SOCIETY") KANSARA: (As Ria) Now, I'm not
                          being dramatic, but these people are evil. CHANG: And Ria is going to use all her power and fury to
                          stop her sister's wedding. Nida Manzoor wrote and directed "Polite Society." And when we sat down
                          to talk about the movie, she told me that her own sister is her best friend - well, at least most
                          of the time. NIDA MANZOOR: We could be the best of friends, but the worst of enemies. Nothing hurt
                          as much as fighting with my sister. There was a sort of real brutality and cruelty that we could,
                          you know, exact on each other. CHANG: And no fight is quite as brutal in "Polite Society" as Khan
                          versus Khan.

                          Manzoor lists directors Mira Nair (The Namesake) and Deepa Mehta (Elements trilogy) as two people
                          who inspire her, since they feature South Asian women in their projects. "It made me believe that
                          our stories are worth being told," Manzoor says, noting that she also looks up to Pedro Almodóvar.
                          "He centered women in a way that I hadn't experienced before." Tamara Jenkins' 1998 debut film
                          Slums of Beverly Hills, which is about a teenage girl struggling to grow up in a lower-middle-class
                          nomadic Jewish family that relocates every few months, made Manzoor feel seen as a teenager. "Each
                          of her movies expresses a real truth of womanhood and there's a rawness to her work that I
                          gravitate to," she explains. In addition to Slums of Beverly Hills, Jenkins directed The Savages
                          and Private Life. Since Manzoor is focused on telling women-centric tales, it makes sense that Jane
                          Austen's works have always resonated with her. "There's something in the way she explores the
                          pressure of society and being a woman who wants to strike out on her own," she says. Polite Society
                          is in theaters now.

                          great relationship with his mother, Raheela. So everyone is thrilled when he and Lena get engaged -

                          being dramatic, but these people are evil. CHANG: And Ria is going to use all her power and fury to

                          of the time. NIDA MANZOOR: We could be the best of friends, but the worst of enemies. Nothing hurt
                          as much as fighting with my sister. There was a sort of real brutality and cruelty that we could,
                          you know, exact on each other. CHANG: And no fight is quite as brutal in "Polite Society" as Khan
                          versus Khan.

                          with a protective plastic layer applied. Gorilla Glass Victus protects the external display. Yes.
                          The Google Pixel Fold has an IPX8 certification, which means it can be submerged in up to 1.5
                          meters of freshwater for up to 30 minutes. No, Google no longer includes chargers with its
                          smartphones. You’ll have to buy a compatible charger that supports USB Power Delivery PPS. The
                          Google Pixel Fold supports dual SIMs. One is a nano-SIM slot, and the second is via eSIM. The Pixel
                          Fold was announced on May 10, 2023. General availability of the phone will commence in June 2023.
                          Folding phones are great for those who want a large-screen device but don’t want the size penalty
                          of carrying a tablet. Based on our hands-on experience, the Pixel Fold should also be a great
                          traditional handset when folded. There’s no indication that Google is working on a second, smaller
                          flip phone to partner the Pixel Fold or challenge the Galaxy Z Flip series.

                          Samsung is currently king. Here’s everything you need to know about the Google Pixel Fold. Google
                          officially unveiled the Pixel Fold at Google I/O on March 10, 2023. It comes in two colors —
                          Obsidian and Porcelain. You can also choose between three official Pixel Fold cases that come in
                          Hazel, Porcelain, and Bay colors (pictured above). Google is charging a similar price to the rival
                          Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4. The 256GB variant of the Pixel Fold will cost you a whopping $1,799. The
                          512GB version is even more expensive at $1,919, which seems costly for Google’s first attempt at a
                          foldable phone. Google hopes you buy the foldable Pixel for its thin form factor, “true pocket
                          size,” loaded camera features, “all-day battery,” multi-tasking skills, and long-lasting software
                          support. However, we’ll only know if it justifies that price when we review the device. As for
                          availability, Google is not casting a very wide net for the Pixel Fold. The handset will only sell
                          in the US, UK, Germany, and Japan, at least to start with.

                          6-inch screen is bright and easy on the eyes — it’s more than nice enough to take in your daily
                          allotment of YouTube videos and e-books, not to mention running two apps side by side. The big
                          bezels around the sides of the screen don’t look great, but they’re pretty comfortable places for
                          your fingers to rest on when holding the phone. For better or worse, the Fold — like the much
                          cheaper 7a — uses the same Tensor G2 processor as the company’s Pixel 7 phones, released last
                          October. In our experience, that means the Fold should be plenty fast for daily use, if not quite
                          as speedy as some other premium phones. For most people, though, the AI features Google uses this
                          chip for — from improving the sound of your phone calls to automatically tweaking photos captured
                          by the Fold’s three rear cameras — may be worth the trade-off. The catch: Where do we start? At
                          nearly $1,800, the Fold is plain out of reach to many. Sure, it’s not alone there — Samsung’s
                          premium Galaxy Z Fold 4 costs the same — but even luxe traditional smartphones cost hundreds less.
                          And because the Fold physically bends in half, there’s a great chance of some kind of physical
                          failure over time. (Brian Rakowski, vice president of product management at Google, told The Post
                          the Fold’s hinge mechanism has been tested to survive more than 200,000 bends.

                          first quarter and was expected to continue. The unemployment rate was 3.4 percent, down from 3.5
                          percent in March, and matched the level in January, which was the lowest since 1969. The
                          higher-than-forecast job gain complicates the Federal Reserve’s potential shift toward a pause in
                          interest rate increases. Chair Jerome H. Powell said on Wednesday that the central bank might
                          continue to raise rates if new data showed the economy wasn’t slowing enough to keep prices down.

Question 290              : When is the end date for the federal PHE for COVID-19?

                          May 11, 2023, marks the end of the federal COVID-19 PHE declaration. After this date, CDC’s
                          authorizations to collect certain types of public health data will expire. The United States has
                          mobilized and sustained a historic response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a nation, we now find
                          ourselves at a different point in the pandemic – with more tools and resources than ever before to
                          better protect ourselves and our communities. CDC has been working for many months to fold the
                          agency’s COVID-19 emergency response activities into its existing structure and programs, as part
                          of an ongoing transition to sustainable public health practice. The agency has also been working
                          with partners, including states and local territories, to prepare for the end of the PHE
                          declaration and communicate updated reporting requirements and cadences. While reporting frequency
                          and source data for some metrics will shift when the PHE declaration ends, CDC will continue to
                          report valuable data to inform individual and community public health actions to protect those at
                          highest risk of severe COVID-19. Our priority remains providing the information necessary to
                          protect the nation’s public health. Most tools, like vaccines, treatments, and testing, will remain
                          available. But, some tools, like certain data sources and reporting, will change. Access to
                          COVID-19 vaccines will generally not be affected for now. The U.S. government is currently
                          distributing free COVID-19 vaccines for all adults and children.

                          current state of COVID-19, this excess capacity is no longer necessary. CMS developed a roadmap for
                          the eventual end of the COVID-19 PHE, which was published in August 2022, and has been sharing
                          information on what health care facilities and providers can do to prepare for future emergencies.
                          This includes facilities returning to normal operations and meeting CMS requirements that promote
                          the safety and quality of care they provide.

                          regular training schedules and submit certification renewals. Additionally, some health facilities
                          repurposed parts of their buildings for COVID-19 treatment or created temporary structures that
                          could be used to accept patients during a COVID-19 surge. facilities will still have the ability to
                          augment their medical surge capacity after the end of the Public Health Emergency through HCAI. For
                          more information, visit the Health Care Quality website. With the end of the State of Emergency,
                          WIC (Women, Infants & Children) program recipients will again be required to enroll or recertify
                          in-person to receive services. In addition, some staffing resources provided to locals related to

                          vaccination are set to end on October 1, 2024. These rules allowed, for example, pharmacy interns,
                          healthcare providers with recently expired licenses and those licensed to work only in one state to
                          give COVID-19 vaccines. There is ongoing deliberation at the federal level and in the courts in

                          It was included in Microsoft Office for Windows (versions 97 to 2003), in Microsoft Publisher and
                          Microsoft Project (versions 98 to 2003), Microsoft FrontPage (versions 2002 and 2003), and
                          Microsoft Office for Mac (versions 98 to 2004). The default assistant in the English version was
                          named Clippit[1]), after a paperclip.[7][8] The Office Assistant used technology initially from
                          Microsoft Bob[9] and later Microsoft Agent, offering advice based on Bayesian algorithms.[3] From
                          Office 2000 onward, Microsoft Agent (.acs) replaced the Microsoft Bob-descended Actor (.act) format
                          as the technology supporting the feature. Users can add other assistants to the folder where Office
                          is installed for them to show up in the Office application, or install in the Microsoft Agent
                          folder in System32 folder. Microsoft Agent-based characters have richer forms and colors, and are
                          not enclosed within a boxed window. Furthermore, the Office Assistant could use the Lernout &
                          Hauspie TruVoice Text-to-Speech Engine to provide output speech capabilities to Microsoft Agent,
                          but it required SAPI 4.0. The Microsoft Speech Recognition Engine allowed the Office Assistant to
                          accept speech input.[10]

  - Source              :
                          According to Alan Cooper, the "Father of Visual Basic", the concept of Clippit was based on a
                          "tragic misunderstanding" of research conducted at Stanford University, showing that the same part
                          of the brain in use while using a mouse or keyboard was also responsible for emotional reactions
                          while interacting with other human beings and thus is the reason people yell at their computer
                          monitors.[11] Microsoft concluded that if humans reacted to computers the same way they react to
                          other humans, it would be beneficial to include a human-like face in their software.[11] As people
                          already related to computers directly as they do with humans, the added human-like face emerged as
                          an annoying interloper distracting the user from the primary conversation.[11] First introduced in
                          Microsoft Office 97,[12] the Office Assistant was codenamed TFC during development.[13] It appeared
                          when the program determined the user could be assisted by using Office wizards, searching help, or
                          advising users on using Office features more effectively. It also presented tips and keyboard
                          shortcuts. For example, typing an address followed by "Dear" would cause the Assistant to appear
                          with the message, "It looks like you're writing a letter. Would you like help?" Microsoft turned
                          off the feature by default in Office XP.[14] The feature was removed altogether in Office 2007 and
                          Office 2008 for Mac.

  - Source              :
                          In addition to new smart devices, Google teased a new AI-enhanced Magic Editor tool at this year’s
                          annual I/O conference. Though we only got a sneak peek, the results are impressive and prove that
                          an era of advanced image manipulation for the masses isn’t far off, thanks to AI. Of course,
                          AI-powered image editing is nothing new for Google. Handy tools like the Magic Eraser, for removing
                          unwanted distractions, and Photo Unblur, for enhancing soft/blurred shots, have been around for
                          several years. And Google has been leveraging AI to help organize and surface images in users’
                          libraries since 2015. But the Magic Editor takes AI-enhanced manipulation a leap further. Not only
                          can users select and edit subjects (similar to using a mask in Lightroom/Capture One) but with a
                          few taps of the screen you can easily scale and reposition subjects in the frame. The demo also
                          shows the tool's ability to expand an image’s composition through generative AI. Of course, the
                          results aren’t perfect. In the example with the balloons, for instance, the portion of the bench
                          created using generative AI shows a noticeable red tint. Similarly, in the waterfall demo, the area
                          under the subject’s arm shows an obvious repeating pattern in the rocks. These criticisms aside,
                          the power of this tool to dramatically reshape image editing on the fly can’t be understated.

                          them by reducing complex workflows to one click or a couple of sliders using machine learning. You
                          can discover a rapidly growing and improving library of artistic and restorative filters, find a
                          “best” idea for inspiration, and refine your image with the familiar tools you know in Photoshop.
                          The filters in this workspace will speed parts of your workflow, but they might not produce the

                          their eligibility for the draft by notifying the NBA offices in writing no later than at least 60

                          CUPERTINO, California, June 5 (Reuters) - Apple (AAPL.O) on Monday unveiled a costly
                          augmented-reality headset called the Vision Pro in its riskiest bet since the introduction of the
                          iPhone more than a decade ago, barging into a market dominated by Meta (META.O). At its annual
                          developer conference, Apple also introduced a raft of new products and features, including a
                          15-inch MacBook Air, a powerful chip called M2 Ultra, improvements to its iOS software and a
                          long-awaited tweak to prevent its autocorrect from annoyingly changing a common expletive to
                          "ducking". The Vision Pro will start at $3,499, more than three times the cost of the priciest
                          headset in Meta's line of mixed and virtual reality devices. The headset will test a market crowded
                          with devices that have yet to gain traction with consumers and put it in direct competition with
                          Facebook-owner Meta after years of clashes between the companies over issues like user privacy and
                          control of developer platforms. Apple emphasized the novelty of the headset's augmented reality
                          features as well as the sports and entertainment partnerships it would offer. The device will use a
                          new chip called R1 that will process information from its sensors in less time than the blink of an
                          eye, Apple said. But the announcements failed to excite Wall Street, which had bid up Apple shares
                          to a record high ahead of the launch. The stock was largely flat in post-market trading.

                          Apple is working on at least three augmented-reality and virtual-reality headset devices, the first
                          of which will likely launch with the name "Apple Reality Pro," according to Bloomberg's Mark
                          Gurman. Concept render based on purported leaked information by Ian ZelboIn the latest edition of
                          his "Power On" newsletter, Gurman explained that there are a minimum of three Apple headsets
                          actively in development that he is aware of, under the codes "N301," "N602," and "N421." The first
                          of these devices, N301, is what Gurman believes will be called "Apple Reality Pro." Apple Reality
                          Pro is said to be the company's "high-end rival" to Meta's upcoming Quest Pro headset. N602 is
                          reportedly the successor to the first Apple Reality Pro headset and could come in at a lower price
                          point. N421 is Apple's long-rumored augmented reality glasses device, though Gurman cautioned that
                          it may not launch for some time. Gurman's latest report is the first concrete indication of what
                          Apple's first headset product could be called. It is worth noting that the "Reality Pro" name lines
                          up with Apple's recent trademark filings. Last week, Bloomberg reported that Apple has trademarked
                          several terms believed to be associated with its upcoming headset devices, including "Reality
                          Processor," "Reality Pro," and "Reality One.

                          Paulson write his memoirs, On The Brink.[6][7] She moved to London from Singapore in 2011.[4][1] In
                          2012, Ryder left the field of journalism and joined Index Ventures, a venture capital firm.[8][9]
                          For two years, she worked with venture capital across Europe and the US, and focused early-stage
                          investments, including digital health.[4] Seeing her friends struggle with building a family and
                          child rearing while balancing careers gave her the idea of a startup to improve healthcare for
                          women and families.[8]

                          Northern Ireland’s four-time major champion to win the 123rd edition of the major by a single

                          GLENDALE, Ariz. — For the second time of his career, Patrick Mahomes is a Super Bowl champion and
                          Super Bowl MVP. The Chiefs quarterback was named the Super Bowl 57 MVP after he led Kansas City to
                          a 38-35 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles. He is the sixth player ever to win multiple Super
                          Bowl MVP awards. Mahomes went 21 of 27 passing for 182 yards and three touchdowns despite playing
                          on a ginger ankle that was reaggravated in the first half. He also added 44 rushing yards in the
                          win. The Chiefs trailed 24-14 at halftime and rattled off 24 second-half points. Mahomes and the
                          Chiefs scored on every possession in the second half. Prior to Sunday, teams that trailed by at
                          least 10 points at halftime were 1-26 in the Super Bowl, per NFL Research. Kansas City rallied back
                          and became the second team to erase at least a 10-point deficit. Super Bowl 57 was the first time
                          two Black quarterbacks started against each other in a Super Bowl. Appropriately, the championship
                          game was a showcase of spectacular performances between Mahomes and Jalen Hurts. Mahomes’ Super
                          Bowl 57 MVP capped off a stellar year for the Chiefs quarterback. He led the NFL with 5,250 passing
                          yards and 41 touchdowns in the regular season, the only quarterback to eclipse 5,000 passing yards
                          and 40 touchdowns this year.
