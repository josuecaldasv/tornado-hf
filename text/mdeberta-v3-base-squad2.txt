                          documentary, Carole King & James Taylor: Just Call Out My Name, to kick off 2022. The documentary
                          opens with a montage featuring the late night hosts. This is before the film gets into the main
                          focus: the 2010 Troubadour Reunion Tour featuring the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame members
                          (Taylor-2000, King-1990 and 2021). The Troubadour shows took place over a series of days in
                          November 2007 with the international concert tour following in 2010. Marshall is privy to exclusive
                          footage from the tour. Both King and Taylor reminisce on their 50-year relationship during
                          exclusive interviews. They also discuss the history behind the songs. Taylor even mentions wanting
                          King to be apart of his band. Music history would have definitely changed, for better or worse.
                          Peter Asher talks about introducing drummer Ross Kunkel to Taylor. Danny “Kootch” Kortchmar is one
                          of Taylor’s oldest friends. Leland Sklar, another friend of Taylor, joined the band and played
                          bass. Asher had met Carole King and invited her to play piano on Taylor’s sophomore album, Sweet
                          Baby James.

                          turnaround in his first year on the job. Diego Pavia was the star of the bowl win. Pavia threw for

                          third-down conversions with his legs in the second half to help his team secure the win. Southern

                          the Golden Eagles seven wins for the 2022 season. And with Gore and a significant chunk of this
                          team’s core expected to return, Southern Miss could be a team on the rise in the Sun Belt next

                          opposite DB Coach Travares Tillman, who serves as the team’s Defensive Pass Game Coordinator.

Question 5              : How many vehicles did Tesla deliver in 2021?
Correct Answers         :  
                          936,172, 936172

                          Microchip shortage? What microchip shortage? EV maker Tesla, which it should be pointed out
                          produces its own chips in-house, seems not to have been bothered by supply-chain issues all that
                          much in 2021, delivering 936,172 vehicles in the year just ended, according to a report by finance
                          news outlet Finbold. That represents a healthy 87 percent increase over 2020, when the company
                          handed over 499,550 Teslas to customers. Even better for the company, it ended the year with a
                          bang, racking up a record number of sales in the last quarter of 2021, or 308,600 units. Most of
                          that total consisted of Model 3 and Model Y models, no surprise. It’s the sixth consecutive quarter
                          that it breaks its record for sales. In 2019, the automaker delivered 367,500 units, so annual
                          sales growth, while not exponential, is clearly accelerating. The company has said in the past that
                          one its main goals is to attain 50 percent sales growth year after year. Once upon a time, Tesla
                          struggled mightily to hit its delivery targets, but no more. There’s also no sign of that growth
                          slowing down any time soon, even as all-electric rivals join the market by the month. Projections
                          made by Finbold put estimated sales for 2022 at over 1.5 million units, for an increase of close to
                          65 percent. Shopicar.

                          the Detroit Lions. The Bengals, who finished with a 10–7 record, were seeking their first Super
                          Bowl title following several decades of losing seasons and playoff struggles. They won their first
                          playoff game since 1990, ending the longest drought in the four major North American sports, en

                          On February 21, 2022, Truth Social was released on Apple iOS,[98] reaching number one on the App
                          Store's top charts.[99][100] Due to an extensive backlog of applicants, upon downloading the app,
                          about 500,000 people who initially attempted to register as users were automatically
                          waitlisted.[101][102][103] The app was installed 872,000 times during its first week, but a month
                          later, new user signup had fallen to 60,000 per week. During that time, weekly visits to
                          truthsocial.com fell from 6 million to fewer than 2 million.[104] Upon its launch, the British
                          automotive solar power company Trailar complained Truth Social's app logo closely resembled its "T"
                          logo.[105] The platform has been criticized for its poor performance at launch, with waitlisting
                          users attempting to register and extended outages.[106] A day after its launch, The Washington Post
                          described it as "a disaster".[101] A week after, Newsweek reported some early adopters were
                          beginning to lose interest in the app due to low numbers of users and poor engagement, although
                          others were willing to persevere with the app to see if things would improve.[107] The Truth Social
                          platform suffered from severe and persistent problems with scalability at launch, limiting the
                          platform's growth.[108][109]

                          On February 21, 2022, Truth Social was released on Apple iOS,[98] reaching number one on the App
                          Store's top charts.[99][100] Due to an extensive backlog of applicants, upon downloading the app,
                          about 500,000 people who initially attempted to register as users were automatically
                          waitlisted.[101][102][103] The app was installed 872,000 times during its first week, but a month
                          later, new user signup had fallen to 60,000 per week. During that time, weekly visits to
                          truthsocial.com fell from 6 million to fewer than 2 million.[104] Upon its launch, the British
                          automotive solar power company Trailar complained Truth Social's app logo closely resembled its "T"
                          logo.[105] The platform has been criticized for its poor performance at launch, with waitlisting
                          users attempting to register and extended outages.[106] A day after its launch, The Washington Post
                          described it as "a disaster".[101] A week after, Newsweek reported some early adopters were
                          beginning to lose interest in the app due to low numbers of users and poor engagement, although
                          others were willing to persevere with the app to see if things would improve.[107] The Truth Social
                          platform suffered from severe and persistent problems with scalability at launch, limiting the
                          platform's growth.[108][109]

Question 9              : What won best drama at 79th Golden Globes?
Correct Answers         :  
                          The Power of the Dog
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                          The 79th Golden Globe Awards honored the best in film and American television of 2021, as chosen by
                          the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA). The ceremony took place privately on January 9,
                          2022.[1] The nominees were announced on December 13, 2021, by rapper Snoop Dogg and HFPA president
                          Helen Hoehne.[1][2] For the first time since 2008, there was no traditional, televised ceremony. In
                          support of boycotts of the HFPA by various media companies, actors, and other creatives over its
                          lack of action to increase the membership diversity of the organization, the Golden Globes' regular
                          broadcaster NBC declined to televise the 79th Golden Globe Awards. The HFPA ultimately chose to
                          hold the presentation privately, with attendance limited to the organization's beneficiaries, and
                          results announced via press release and highlighted on the Golden Globe Awards' social media pages.
                          The films Belfast and The Power of the Dog were tied for the most nominations, at seven each. The
                          latter tied with Steven Spielberg's West Side Story and HBO's drama Succession with the most awards
                          of the night, with three each. These included the awards for Best Drama Film, Best Musical or
                          Comedy Film and Best Drama Series, respectively.

                          On the TV side, ABC comedy Abbott Elementary — which boasted the most nominations of any show with
                          five — built off of its Emmy momentum and went to the head of the class, winning best comedy honors
                          and Golden Globes for Quinta Brunson and Tyler James Williams. An even bigger Emmy magnet, HBO's
                          The White Lotus, enjoyed the privilege of converting its four nominations into two awards, one for
                          best limited series and another for Jennifer Coolidge (who also delivered the funniest speech of
                          the night). And then Game of Thrones prequel House of the Dragon added some surprise to the night
                          by claiming the best drama award. Elsewhere, Tár's Cate Blanchett, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever's
                          Angela Bassett, and Elvis' Austin Butler scored trophies, along with The Bear's Jeremy Allen White,
                          Euphoria's Zendaya, and Yellowstone's Kevin Costner. In addition, Murphys were honored: Five-time
                          Globe winner Ryan Murphy was given the Carol Burnett Award and Eddie Murphy was handed the Cecil B.
                          DeMille Award. Find out who else had a Golden night by checking out our complete list of winners.

Question 13              : How much is Microsoft acquiring Activision Blizzard for?
Correct Answers         :

                          Filed under: There’s a steady drip of news as the tech giant tries to clear its huge deal — here’s
                          what’s new Microsoft is attempting to persuade regulators around the world to clear its $68.7
                          billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard — the biggest deal of its kind the gaming industry has
                          ever seen. Amid concerns about its effect on competition in the industry — particularly in the
                          nascent cloud gaming market — and in the face of ardent lobbying against the deal by competitor
                          Sony, the U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority first decided to block the acquisition, then
                          agreed to further talks with Microsoft and Activision. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has
                          withdrawn its attempt block the deal legally after a federal judge ruled in favor of Microsoft
                          being allowed to close the deal. The European Union, meanwhile, has given the deal its seal of
                          approval. Here’s the latest on Microsoft’s plans to snap up Activision Blizzard. According to
                          Reuters and Bloomberg, the Federal Trade Commission has withdrawn its administrative case against
                          Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard, which was due to go before an in-house judge in
                          August. Microsoft and Activision had requested the case be withdrawn after the FTC lost its case
                          arguing for a block on the deal in district court, and was denied an extension of a temporary block
                          by an appeals court. The move means Microsoft and Activision can now try to persuade the U.S.
                          antitrust regulator to accept a settlement.

                          A star-studded lineup of Super Bowl LVII commercials is set to hit our screens on Sunday. While
                          millions of people will be tuning into the intense NFL action between the Kansas City Chiefs and
                          Philadelphia Eagles, a large sum will be even more excited for the iconic commercials. The cost for
                          a 30-second commercial during this year’s Super Bowl is reaching a record-high amount, with
                          advertisers hoping their ad makes a bang for the viewers. Ahead of the game, let’s take a look at
                          the costs of a Super Bowl commercial in 2023 and more history about the big game day ads: In 2023,
                          a 30-second Super Bowl commercial costs a record-high average of $7 million, according to Forbes.
                          In 2022, a 30-second commercial slot during the Super Bowl was $6.5 million, which was an increase
                          from the $5.5 million asked for in 2021. Here were the prices in some recent previous years:

                          There's a reason commercials during the Super Bowl have to refer to the event as the "Big Game"
                          rather than "Super Bowl LVII." The reason is that the term has been a registered NFL trademark
                          since 1969, requiring commercials, radio hosts and other specific media personnel to pay to use the
                          official name.

                          THE MOST-LOVED GAME DAY SNACKS AHEAD OF SUPER BOWL 2022, ACCORDING TO INSTACART The price of a
                          Super Bowl ad has always attracted attention for the outsized cost: the average cost of a 30-second
                          ad on national TV during primetime averages $115,000 – a number the Super Bowl surpassed in the
                          1970s, according to Nielsen Media Research. The automobile and food and beverage industries make up
                          the bulk of spending. A FOX Business analysis in 2020 marked out Honda, FedEx, Miller, Dodge,
                          Toyota, Ford, McDonald’s, Coca-Cola, Pepsi and Budweiser as the companies that have spent the most
                          over the years, with Budweiser spending $449.5 million on 135 ads across 53 Super Bowls. The Super
                          Bowl crossed the landmark $1 million mark in 1995, climbing to $2 million in the new millennium.
                          The price steadily rose over the following decade, reaching 2.95 million in 2010. SUPER BOWL 2022:
                          BEST TV AND SPEAKER DEALS AHEAD OF THE BIG GAME The price skyrocketed after that, climbing to $5
                          million by 2017 before appearing to hit a limit as the cost leveled off, rising only another
                          $300,000 over the next three years. The cost had still almost doubled in a decade.

                          Seahawks.com Writer The great week for Seahawks wide receiver Tyler Lockett continues. Just days
                          after learning his feature on Black Wall Street had won an Emmy Award, Lockett was honored again on
                          Thursday night as the 2022 Seattle Male Sports Star of The Year. The live awards show has been a
                          tradition in Emerald City dating back to 1936. Created by the Seattle Post-Intelligencer and
                          renowned sports editor Royal Brougham, the show has honored some of the biggest names to play
                          professional sports in the city. Since arriving in Seattle from Kansas State in 2015, Lockett has
                          developed into a reliable and incredibly productive receiver in the Seahawks offense, and 2021 was
                          arguably his best season yet, setting a career high with 1,175 receiving yards, his
                          third-consecutive 1,000-yard season. The successes have continued off the field. Lockett received
                          the 2021 Steve Largent Award, given annually to the team contributor who best exemplifies the
                          spirit, dedication, and integrity of the Seahawks. He was also the Seahawks nominee for the NFL's
                          Walter Payton Man of the Year Award, recognizing a player for their excellence on and off the
                          field. And if that wasn't enough, Lockett passed his real estate licensing exam earlier this
                          offseason, selling his first home in April.

Question 16              : Who are the recipients of the 2022 Ivan Allen Jr. Prize for Social Courage?
Correct Answers         :  
                          Lawrence Williams, Ralph Long Jr., Ford Greene, Ronald Yancey
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - Source              :
                          In 1961, three Black students began classes at Georgia Tech and made history, making the Institute
                          the first higher education entity to peacefully integrate in the Deep South without a court order.
                          Civil unrest was rampant throughout college campuses across the South. In recognition of their
                          roles as trailblazers, Tech’s first Black students — Lawrence Williams, Ralph Long Jr., and the
                          late Ford Greene, along with the first Black graduate Ronald Yancey — were awarded the 2022 Ivan
                          Allen Jr. Prize for Social Courage on April 20 at the Biltmore Ballroom in Atlanta. A symposium was
                          led by 2020 Ivan Allen Jr. Prize recipient Charlayne Hunter-Gault where Long Jr., Williams, and
                          Yancey discussed the integration of the Institute, the former students’ personal experiences, and
                          the continued struggle for racial equity and inclusion at higher education institutes across the
                          nation. During the panel session, the three former students recounted the racism they encountered —
                          despite a facade of peaceful integration. Although their experiences left them feeling socially and
                          intellectually isolated from most of the student body at the time, the pioneers expressed their
                          hope that future generations of Black students at Tech feel at home on campus. “I’m so thankful for
                          those who continue to matriculate here and carry on the tradition,” said Williams. A video greeting
                          from Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens, a Georgia Tech chemical engineering graduate himself, was
                          presented at the celebration.

  - Source              :
                          12] In January 2022, The Verge reported that Google was building an AR headset which used
                          "outward-facing cameras to blend computer graphics with a video feed of the real world", internally
                          codenamed Project Iris and being developed in a highly secretive and secure facility located in the
                          San Francisco Bay Area. Overseen by Bavor, the headset was to be powered by the Android operating
                          system as well as a custom system on a chip akin to Tensor, expected to launch in 2024 alongside
                          Project Starline. Other key people named as part of the project include Shahram Izadi, Eddie Chung,
                          Scott Huffman, Kurt Akeley, and Lucovsky.[13] An early prototype of the headset bore a close
                          resemblance to the North Focals.[14] In March, The Information reported that Google would acquire
                          Raxium, an AR hardware startup, for approximately $1 billion, and would continue to make further
                          acquisitions to assist in their AR and mixed reality (MR) work.[15] The acquisition was completed a
                          month later.[16] In May 2022, Google unveiled a different version of Iris resembling eyeglasses
                          with live translation capabilities during the 2022 Google I/O keynote.[14][17][18] The company
                          began publicly testing these prototypes across the U.S. in August,[19] before expanding into Canada
                          in October.[20] According to Business Insider, Google executives' constantly changing strategy for

                          Google’s augmented reality eyewear is coming to disrupt your face and your business model. If you
                          don’t even have to pull your phone out to take a photo, get directions, or message with friends,
                          why would you need to buy the latest iPhone or spend so much time on Facebook? It could be a year
                          before Google eyewear reaches stores, but that’s why these and other tech companies need to
                          strategize now. If they wait to see if the device is a hit, the world could be seeing through
                          Google-tinted glasses by the time they adapt. Apple and Facebook’s bet might be to team up… If you
                          haven’t heard, Google today announced it is beginning public tests of augmented reality glasses
                          with the codename Project Glass. A mouthwatering mock-up video of what the device might eventually
                          be capable of shows someone using voice commands to send messages, take photos, share to Google+,
                          see the locations of friends, view maps, get directions, set calendar reminders, and more. Cramming
                          all the functionality into a sleek set of glasses is going to take time and effort, but the
                          Google(x) skunklabs is on it. There’s a dozen ways the product could flop, most obviously if the
                          glasses are awkward and unstylish, but also if they’re too heavy, expensive, fragile, or the world
                          is just not quite ready. Let’s forget those for a second.

                          Daniel Dominguez Meta has unveiled its AI Research SuperCluster (RSC) supercomputer, aimed at
                          accelerating AI research and helping the company build the metaverse. The RSC will help the company
                          build new and better AI models, working across hundreds of different languages, and to develop new
                          augmented reality tools. Developing the next generation of advanced AI will require powerful new
                          computers capable of quintillions of operations per second. Meta’s researchers have already started
                          using RSC to train large models in natural-language processing (NLP) and computer vision for
                          research, with the aim of one day training models with trillions of parameters across Meta’s
                          businesses, from content-moderation algorithms used to detect hate speech on Facebook and
                          Instagram, to augmented-reality features that will one day be available in the metaverse. RSC can
                          train models that use multimodal signals to determine whether an action, sound or image is harmful
                          or benign. Meta claims this will not only help keep people safe on Meta’s services today, but also
                          in the metaverse.

                          Meta pulled the plug on a large-scale rollout of the custom chip, which was planned for 2022, and
                          instead placed orders for billions of dollars’ worth of Nvidia GPUs that required major redesigns
                          of several of its data centers. In an effort to turn things around, Meta made plans to start
                          developing a more ambitious in-house chip, due out in 2025, capable of both training AI models and
                          running them. And that was the main topic of today’s presentation. Meta calls the new chip the Meta
                          Training and Inference Accelerator, or MTIA for short, and describes it as a part of a “family” of
                          chips for accelerating AI training and inferencing workloads. (“Inferencing” refers to running a
                          trained model.) The MTIA is an ASIC, a kind of chip that combines different circuits on one board,
                          allowing it to be programmed to carry out one or many tasks in parallel. An AI chip Meta

                          important workloads, we needed a tailored solution that’s co-designed with the model, software
                          stack and the system hardware,” Bjorlin continued. “This provides a better experience for our users
                          across a variety of services.” Custom AI chips are increasingly the name of the game among the Big
                          Tech players.

                          currently administered. As you may know, many colleges and universities have become test-optional
                          due to COVID’s impact. Harvard made news in December 2021 for extending their test-optional policy
                          for four more years—only the number of years was exceptional about Harvard’s announcement. Stanford
                          announced a one-year extension of its policy in November 2021, as well. The University of
                          California and California State University systems announced a permanent test-free policy around
                          the same time. And recently, the Iowa Board of Regents announced all three state universities in
                          Iowa are permanently test-optional. And while the expansion of the test-optional policy may
                          continue, the trajectory doesn’t seem to be on a linear path. According to The Princeton Review
                          Summer 2021 College Administrator Survey , 87% of schools were test-optional for fall 2021, but for
                          fall 2022 admissions, that number dropped to 78%. It’s important to remember that test-optional
                          doesn’t mean test-blind.

                          Participation in the Games was impacted by the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine; the
                          International Olympic Committee (IOC) condemned Russia for violating the Olympic Truce, and called
                          for both Russia and its supporter Belarus to be excluded from international sporting events. While

                          under the Paralympic flag, it backtracked on 3 March 2022 – the eve of the opening ceremonies –
                          following threats of a boycott by multiple NPCs, and announced that Belarusian and Russian athletes
                          would be prohibited from competing. The Belarusian and Russian delegations competed at a

Question 23              : Who won the Super Bowl 2022?

                          Super Bowl LVI[12] was an American football game played to determine the champion of the National
                          Football League (NFL) for the 2021 season. The National Football Conference (NFC) champion Los
                          Angeles Rams defeated the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Cincinnati Bengals, 23–20.
                          The game was played on February 13, 2022, at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, the home
                          stadium of the Rams, marking the second consecutive and second overall Super Bowl with a team
                          playing and winning in its home stadium.[13][14][15][16] The Rams' victory was their second, first
                          as a Los Angeles-based team, and first since winning 1999's Super Bowl XXXIV when they were based
                          in St. Louis. Finishing with a 12–5 record, the Rams reached their fifth appearance after acquiring
                          veteran quarterback Matthew Stafford, who had not won a playoff game in his previous 12 years with
                          the Detroit Lions. The Bengals, who finished with a 10–7 record, were seeking their first Super
                          Bowl title following several decades of losing seasons and playoff struggles. They won their first
                          playoff game since 1990, ending the longest drought in the four major North American sports, en
                          route to their third Super Bowl appearance and first since 1988's Super Bowl XXIII.

                          Lost Ark was fully released in South Korea on December 4, 2019, and in North American, South
                          American, and European regions on February 11, 2022, with Amazon Games serving as the global
                          publisher.[16] Users that pre-purchased one of four founder's packs could play 3 days early on
                          February 8, 2022.[17][18][19][20] The game was initially unavailable in Belgium and the Netherlands
                          due to the countries' stringent loot box regulations,[21] with the latter later reversing its
                          decision.[22] Within twenty-four hours of its release, Lost Ark became the second most played game
                          on Steam.[23][24] In 2021, there were plans between Smilegate and game publisher HappyTuk [zh] to
                          launch Lost Ark in Taiwan.[25] It was announced in 2023 that the release of Taiwanese servers has
                          been delayed but not canceled.[26] Lost Ark received "generally favorable" reviews according to
                          review aggregator Metacritic.[27] PC Magazine praised Lost Ark's combat, writing, "Abilities look
                          good, sound sufficiently powerful, and feel great to use. You can’t help but feel like a combat god
                          when you divekick a crowd, and blast fodder monsters into bloody chunks.

                          The Endgame is an American crime drama thriller television series that premiered on NBC on February
                          21, 2022. The series is created by Nicholas Wootton and Jake Coburn.[1][2] In May 2022, the series
                          was canceled after one season.[3] In this heist drama, criminal mastermind Elena Federova squares
                          off against principled FBI agent Val Turner.[4] On April 21, 2021, The Untitled Nick Wootton/Jake
                          Coburn Project was given a pilot order by NBC. It was created by Nicholas Wootton and Jake Coburn
                          who were expected to executive produce alongside Julie Plec and Emily Cummins. Wootton also wrote
                          the pilot.[5] On September 21, 2021, NBC ordered The Endgame to series. Justin Lin and Andrew
                          Schneider were added as executive producers. Lin also directed the pilot. Universal Television,
                          Nicholas Wootton Productions, Jake Coburn Productions, Inc., My So-Called Company, and Perfect
                          Storm Entertainment are the production companies involved with producing the series.[1] Upon the

                          The show centered on a professional thief named Mickey O’Neil (played by the dashing Dougray
                          Scott), the man who was orchestrating probably one of the biggest heists that Los Angeles – and
                          maybe even the world – had ever seen. Mickey put together a handpicked team of experts to
                          simultaneously rob three big jewelry stores along Rodeo Drive during the Academy Awards when
                          everyone was too distracted by the glitz and glamor of Hollywood’s elite to notice the elaborate
                          heist unfold. NBC’s newest foray into the heist TV drama genre is The Endgame which just recently
                          premiered on the network. Starring Morena Baccarin and Ryan Michelle Bathé, The Endgame follows
                          Elena Federova, an international arms dealer and criminal mastermind who was recently captured by
                          the FBI. Elena has orchestrated a number of bank heists all across New York and nobody knows why.
                          But FBI agent Val Turner gets put on the case and might just be able to foil Elena’s ambitious plan
                          and discover what her endgame is. The only thing better than watching a heist unfold on a scripted
                          TV show is watching it unfold knowing it’s completely based on real-life events. That’s exactly the
                          case with ITV’s four-part miniseries titled Hatton Garden (also known as The Heist at Hatton
                          Garden), which is based on the real-life burglary of a safety deposit vault in the eponymous Hatton
                          Garden, London.

                          Jump to Russia surprised the world on February 24, 2022, by invading Ukraine, starting a brutal
                          battle that is still raging today. Russia's President Vladimir Putin has given varying public
                          explanations for why he launched the invasion. Here are the reasons Putin gave, how they match with
                          reality, and the other likely reasons why Russia sent its armed forces into an independent,
                          sovereign nation. Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union, before declaring itself an independent
                          country, cementing the move in a referendum days before the USSR collapsed in December 1991. The
                          country has maintained its independence ever since. But Putin still refers to Ukraine as Russian,
                          and denies it's a nation in its own right. He told then-US President George W. Bush in 2008 that
                          Ukraine wasn't even a country. Stephen Hall, a Russian politics expert at the University of Bath in
                          the UK, said many Russians still hold this view, and that "it isn't just the Kremlin." Hall said
                          Russia sees Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, as the "mother of Russian cities," and for Putin he can't
                          have that being outside his own country. Hall added that Russia needs to claim Ukraine in order to
                          back up its argument to being a great power that has existed for millennia. Without it "Russia
                          can't claim a thousand years of history because Kyiv was already in existence 1,200 years ago, when
                          Moscow was a forest," he said.

                          "Nazism is Russia-phobia to them. So the Ukrainians are Nazis because they're anti-Russian." Putin
                          also promotes this Nazi idea to win support in the West, where people have always been
                          "susceptible" to the argument that Ukraine has a Nazi problem, Hall said. He said Putin's strategy
                          is partly "throw things at the wall and see what sticks." According to Graham, there is no evidence
                          that Putin was under public pressure to invade Ukraine, which suggests at least some of his
                          reasoning was personal. All three experts said Putin's desire to be revered in history books likely
                          motivated him to attack. Hall said Putin's anxiety is around "am I going to be a footnote in
                          Russian history or are they going to write books about me like they do Peter the Great, Catherine
                          the Great, Stalin." Taylor agrees, saying that Putin sees himself as "a great historic Russian
                          leader restoring Russian lands, and he was thinking about his legacy as he turned 70." "What have
                          the great Czars done? They've expanded Russian territory," Graham said. Even with all of the above,
                          why the invasion happened when it did is an intriguing question. Experts pointed to multiple
                          reasons why Russia invaded in February 2022. One was the arrival of Zelenskyy, who came to power in
                          2019 after a career as a comedian and actor. Putin believed that in Zelenskyy "he had someone he
                          could manipulate in Ukraine," Hall said.

                          Filed under: FromSoftware and George R.R. Martin’s long-awaited game arrives in 2022 Elden Ring,
                          the long-awaited new game from Dark Souls developer FromSoftware, has finally come out of hiding.
                          Publisher Bandai Namco gave fans a new look at the epic fantasy role-playing game during Thursday’s
                          Summer Game Fest Kickoff Live stream. The new trailer for Elden Ring showed gameplay for the first
                          time, gameplay that will look very familiar to fans of Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and Sekiro: Shadows
                          Die Twice. We also got a release date — Jan. 21, 2022 — and platforms. Elden Ring is coming to
                          current-gen and last-gen consoles, as well as PC. Elden Ring appears to have many elements familiar
                          to Dark Souls players: swords and sorcery, summonable allies, and giant mythical monsters to
                          battle. But it also has something fans of FromSoftware aren’t accustomed to: horses! Check out new
                          4K images of Elden Ring in the gallery below. The last time we heard anything about Elden Ring was
                          in June 2019, when Bandai Namco and FromSoftware officially revealed the game.

                          11] As of January 2022, Świątek has reached the second week of a Grand Slam at six consecutive
                          majors, beginning with her 2020 French Open title, setting a record for the longest streak of
                          second-week progressions.[12] In the quarterfinal she defeated Kaia Kanepi in a match at three
                          hours and one minute before losing to Danielle Collins in the semifinal the following day.[13][14]
                          In February, Świątek entered into the Qatar Open, where she was seeded seventh. She defeated
                          Viktorija Golubic and Daria Kasatkina in the second and third rounds, respectively. In the
                          quarterfinals, she defeated top seeded Aryna Sabalenka before advancing to the semifinals where she
                          played against Maria Sakkari, winning in straight sets. In the final, she won against fourth-seeded
                          Anett Kontaveit, losing only two games, to claim her second WTA 1000 championship title.[15] At
                          Indian Wells, Świątek reached her third WTA 1000 final, where, as the third seed, she defeated
                          Anhelina Kalinina, Clara Tauson and Angelique Kerber in three sets, and Madison Keys and Simona
                          Halep, in straight sets. She defeated sixth seed Maria Sakkari, in straight sets, to win her fifth
                          title. With the back-to-back Masters wins, Świątek reached a career-high ranking of world No. 2.[16]

                          The second set was entirely different from the first. While Jabeur again didn't win a game until
                          Swiatek was up 3-0, she finally found her gear. Her excellent slice finally began to appear and she
                          began going to the net more, helping her win four of the next five games. Swiatek appeared to have
                          finally wrestled the momentum of the match back to her side, breaking a 5-5 tie to get within one
                          game of the title, but she couldn't close and Jabeur tied it up once again. The tiebreak was close,
                          and it looked like Jabeur could run away with it at any moment, but an unforced error from Jabeur
                          ended the tiebreak and gave Swiatek her first US Open championship and her third career Grand Slam
                          trophy. When it was all over, Swiatek and Jabeur shared a heartfelt embrace, and then Swiatek
                          immediately burst into happy tears. She'd earned it. This victory puts an exclamation point on the
                          best year of Swiatek's young career — or the best year of anyone’s career, really. She started 2022
                          by falling just short of the finals at the Australian Open (she was knocked out in the semis by
                          Danielle Collins), but she rebounded to produce one of the most dominant stretches of tennis we’ve
                          seen in decades. Swiatek beat Annet Kontaveit to win the Qatar Open.

                          surpassing its gold medal tally of five during the 2010 winter edition.[4] Athletes from that
                          nation also won 15 medals overall, which eclipsed its record of 11 at both the 2006 and 2010 winter
                          editions.[5] Biathletes Johannes Thingnes Bø, Quentin Fillon Maillet, and Marte Olsbu Røiseland,

                          The 2022 Winter Olympics will give athletes from across the globe the chance to have their
                          country’s national anthem played following their triumphs. If history is any indication, crowds
                          expect to hear some songs on repeat. The Winter Olympics are often dominated by Europe with the
                          United States and Canada in the mix throughout the competition. Countries that rose to the top of
                          the podium at the first edition of the Winter Games in 1924 have traditionally stayed relevant to
                          this day. Others had dominant periods before being merged or broken off into different countries
                          all together. Between established European powers and two North American powerhouses, which nation
                          has the highest medal count of all time? Here are the 10 countries with the most total medals in

                          orange, but they often leave it wearing gold. The Netherland’s 121 speed skating medals are 37 more
                          than any other country in the sport. The total is also nearly twice as much as the country’s haul

                          Tournament, for sponsorship reasons) was the postseason men's basketball tournament for the 2021–22
                          Atlantic Coast Conference men's basketball season. It was held at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn,

                          title and the first overall seed. Notre Dame, North Carolina, and Miami were the other teams to

                          landed in almost the same spot, it was celebration time for the Tar Heels, sadness for the
                          Wolfpack. North Carolina defeated N.C. State, 9-5, to win the 2022 ACC tournament title Sunday, the
                          eighth title in school history and first for the Tar Heels since 2019. Carolina won three straight
                          ACC tournament titles from 1982-84 and won it again in 1990 before adding championships in 2007 and
                          2019. Scott Forbes, the Tar Heels’ second-year skipper, won a championship in his first attempt.
                          The title still eludes N.C. State head coach Elliott Avent, in his 26th season. “ACC champs,”
                          Forbes said, tossing his hands in the air. “Our whole approach was we wanted to win an ACC
                          championship for the University of North Carolina, we just happened to be playing N.C. State.” N.C.
                          State hasn’t won an ACC title since 1992. They are 0-8 in title games since then. Sunday’s showdown
                          was the first time since 1990 that the Tar Heels and Wolfpack played in a title game. Carolina won
                          that contest, 5-0.

Question 34              : What chip does the iPhone 14 have?

                          A16 chip inside. By differentiating the chip between the four iPhone 14 models, Apple is

                          iPhone 14 Pro models. While we’re still waiting on real-world testing, the roadmap from Apple’s

                          the A15, which is also the same as the A14. Sticking to the same fabrication size limits the
                          year-over-year performance improvements, but it doesn’t mean we won’t see any improvements. From
                          the A14 to the A15 chips, Apple delivered ~10% performance and efficiency improvements. It’s

                          year-over-year performance gains. One sketchy iPhone 14 Pro rumor suggested that the first testing
                          with the A16 chip indicated performance would only be a “few percent” better than the A15. Apple

                          JAY-Zand director Jeymes Samuel are teaming up again. Six months after the release of their Netflix
                          show-stopper The Harder They Fall, on Thursday, it was announced that the two are collaborating on
                          a film adaption of graphic comics Irredeemable and its spinoff Incorruptible. Directed by Samuel
                          with co-production from Hov and James Lassiter, Kemp Powers, whose credits include 2021 Disney+
                          film Soul and Marvel Studios upcoming Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, will write the script.
                          Boom! Studios’ Stephen Christy and Ross Richie will also assist as co-producers. The Irredeemable
                          graphic series dramatizes how The Plutonian, the world's greatest hero, snapped and became a
                          supervillain. In the comic's sister series Incorruptible, supervillain Max Damage responds to
                          Plutonian's evil by transforming into a superhero. In a statement, Netflix briefly explained the
                          synopsis of the upcoming film. "Protagonists from each series – one a villain on a quest to become
                          a superhero, and the other a fallen hero turned villain – face off." Originating from comic book
                          publisher Boom! Studios, the series was created by author Mark Waid with illustration from Peter
                          Krause. Krause spoke with Deadline about the upcoming Netflix adaptation.

                          Federation.[35][36] The Tianwen-1 mission was the second of three Martian exploration missions
                          launched during the July 2020 window, after the United Arab Emirates Space Agency's Hope orbiter,
                          and before NASA's Mars 2020 mission, which landed the Perseverance rover with the attached
                          Ingenuity helicopter drone.[37] China's planetary exploration program is officially dubbed the
                          "Tianwen Series". "Tianwen-1" (Chinese: 天问一号) is the program's first mission, and subsequent
                          planetary missions will be numbered sequentially.[38] The name Tianwen means "questions to heaven"
                          or "quest for heavenly truth", from the same classical poem written by Qu Yuan (c. 340–278 BC), an
                          ancient Chinese poet.

                          In the week following the heavily publicized Undertaker inductee news, media outlets observed that
                          many WWE fans had advocated for the idea of The Undertaker to be the sole inductee for the Class of
                          2022, reasoning that his legend status in the company would warrant such an honor.[3] The solo
                          dedication was also publicly endorsed by fellow Hall of Famer Bubba Ray Dudley, Class of 2018,
                          sharing as well of his opinion that such an event would be an entertainment draw and sell out the
                          arena.[4] The character of "The Undertaker" was created by WWE Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
                          Vince McMahon, who made a rare media appearance on The Pat McAfee Show on March 3, where he
                          announced that he would be inducting The Undertaker into the WWE Hall of Fame. In praising The
                          Undertaker both inside and outside of character in a heartfelt message, McMahon elaborated that
                          this induction would be one of the most difficult endeavors of his life because of his longtime
                          history with The Undertaker, what they had been through together, and how close they had been
                          behind the scenes.[5] Reacting to the heavily publicized announcement from McMahon, The Undertaker
                          issued a Twitter response later that same day, which read: After over 30 years of long roads
                          traveled, countless hours of TV, and one hell of a ride together...

  - Source              :
                          In a mid-credits scene, Loretta and Alan are shown attending a meditation class where they
                          unexpectedly meet Jack, who is revealed to have somehow survived after being shot in the head, and
                          claims he did so by using a 'different' ten percent of his brain. Additionally, Raymond Lee appears
                          as Officer Gomez, Adam Nee appears as Officer Sawyer, and Stephen Lang (credited as Slang) appears
                          as the fantasy villain imagined by Loretta. In October 2020, it was announced Sandra Bullock would
                          star in the film The Lost City of D, with Aaron and Adam Nee directing from a screenplay by Seth
                          Gordon and Dana Fox, with Bullock serving as a producer under her Fortis Films banner, and
                          Paramount Pictures to distribute.[8] Bullock originally passed on the project because she felt the
                          story was "outdated" due to it being in development for seven years.[9] That December, Channing
                          Tatum was cast as the male lead.[10] Between March and April 2021, Patti Harrison, Da'Vine Joy
                          Randolph, Daniel Radcliffe, Brad Pitt, and Oscar Nunez joined the cast, with Pitt and Lang
                          appearing in cameo roles.[11][12][13][14][15] Principal photography began in May 2021[16] in the
                          Dominican Republic, including Samaná, Santo Domingo, Casa de Campo, Monte Plata Province and

  - Source              :
                          The actor and producer is very meticulous with every role he takes on, unafraid to take his
                          performance to the extreme or sacrifice his physical appearance in pursuit of his characters. This
                          became evident in Fight Club, David Fincher's 1999 film in which he co-stars alongside Edward
                          Norton and Helena Bonham Carter. In this production, Pitt plays soap salesman and street fighter
                          Tyler Durden, and for this role, he made quite an extreme decision: he visited the dentist to have
                          his teeth chipped (via Entertainment Weekly). After filming was over, Pitt went back to the dentist
                          to have his teeth fixed as if nothing had happened. His minor role in The Lost City as Jack Trainer
                          was highly acclaimed and absolutely stole the spotlight. In The Lost City, Bowen Yang has a small
                          role as Ray, the moderator of Loretta Sage's press conference. In recent years, Yang gained
                          notoriety for his appearances on Saturday Night Live, Girls5Eva and the rom-coms Fire Island and
                          Bros. However, a little-known fact about this actor and writer is that his career could have gone
                          in a completely different direction: when he was younger, Bowen enrolled at New York University to
                          study chemistry, intending to become a doctor inspired by his favorite fictional character:
                          Cristina Yang from Grey's Anatomy. But as years went by, he came to realize that he was influenced
                          not by Cristina, but by Sandra Oh, the actress who portrayed her, and eventually discovered that
                          acting was his true passion.

                          What many people don't know is that this production was actually inspired by the actor's own
                          experience working as a stripper right after dropping out of Glenville State College. However, this
                          was not the only eccentric job Tatum held before making it big in the film industry: over the
                          years, he worked as a bricklayer, department store clerk, model, and even dog and cat sitter at a
                          puppy nursery in Tampa. In the latter job, his main tasks were playing with puppies and taking care
                          of them, something any animal lover would love to do. In The Lost City, Daniel Radcliffe plays
                          Abigail Fairfax, a billionaire who kidnaps Loretta so that she can get him the hidden treasure
                          depicted in her books. Undoubtedly, Radcliffe's best-known role so far is as Harry Potter, the
                          titular character of the film saga based on J.K. Rowling's books, released in 2001. The actor
                          played this famous wizard from the age of 12 to 22, and from then on, he kept expanding his
                          portfolio by taking on increasingly challenging projects, which made him one of the best actors in
                          recent years.

                          stony, and Smith got to his feet, marched onto the stage, and slapped Rock in the face. The audio
                          of the US broadcast went out at that point, but it continued uncensored in other countries,
                          including Japan and Australia. “Wow! Wow!” said Rock, swaying slightly as Smith strode back to his

                          him saying, “That was the greatest night in the history of television. Okay. Okay.” Then he went on
                          with presenting the Oscar (which went to Summer of Soul, directed by Questlove). Just minutes
                          later, Smith won the Oscar for Best Actor for his performance in King Richard, in which he played
                          Richard Williams, father of Venus and Serena Williams. “Richard Williams was a fierce defender of
                          his family,” Smith began as he took the stage.

                          Apple M2 is a series of ARM-based system on a chip (SoC) designed by Apple Inc. as a central
                          processing unit (CPU) and graphics processing unit (GPU) for its Mac desktops and notebooks, and
                          the iPad Pro tablet. It is the second generation of ARM architecture intended for Apple's Mac
                          computers after switching from Intel Core to Apple silicon, succeeding the M1. Apple announced the
                          M2 on June 6, 2022, at WWDC, along with models of the MacBook Air and the 13-inch MacBook Pro using
                          the M2. The M2 is made with TSMC's "Enhanced 5-nanometer technology" N5P process and contains 20
                          billion transistors, a 25% increase from the M1. Apple claims CPU improvements up to 18% and GPU
                          improvements up to 35% compared to the M1.[3] The M2 was followed by the professional-focused M2
                          Pro and M2 Max chips in January 2023. The M2 Max is a higher-powered version of the M2 Pro, with
                          more GPU cores and memory bandwidth, and a larger die size.[4] Apple introduced the M2 Ultra in
                          June 2023, combining two M2 Max chips in one package.[1]

                          sells, and now they are available with new M2 Pro and M2 Max chips. Apple introduced the M2 chip in
                          the 13-inch MacBook Pro in June 2022, so there’s been a bit of a wait for the enhanced M2 Pro and
                          Max chips to arrive, but now they are here. Here’s everything you need to know about the new
                          14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models which went on sale on January 24, 2023. Apple has updated
                          the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro with M2 Pro and M2 Max chips. Battery life is longer. Prices
                          for the 14-inch model still start at $1,999 in the U.S. where in the U.K. the price is up from
                          £1,899 to £2,149. The entry level 14-inch model offers a 10-Core CPU and 16-Core GPU and 16GB
                          memory. While the maximum M2 Max offers 12-Core CPU, 30-Core GPU and up to 96GB of unified memory.
                          The new models include support for Wi-Fi 6E, advanced HDMI, that supports 8K displays for the first
                          time. Read on for more information.

                          and M1 chip at its Spring Loaded event back in April 2021. Now we have passed the two-year
                          anniversary of the new-look iMac, we’re hoping Apple will update it sometime in 2023 with a new
                          chip – which would be fitting with this year marking 25 since Apple introduced the original G3 iMac
                          – but the wait could be even longer. Apple is well into the launch of the second generation of
                          Apple silicon, with the M2 arriving in June 2022, the M2 Pro and M2 Max coming in January 2023, and
                          the M2 Ultra arriving in June. That makes the 24-inch iMac one of the few remaining M1 Macs. Can we
                          expect Apple to introduce an M2 variant of the iMac soon? Read on to find out. Update July 18:
                          There could be an M3 iMac by the end 2023. As per a June 2023 newsletter, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman
                          believes that Apple is preparing two new 24-inch iMacs for release in late 2023 or early 2024.

                          6] Production designer David Korins designed a new stage for the show.[38] Music producer and
                          songwriter Adam Blackstone served as musical director for the telecast and conductor for the
                          orchestra, which featured musicians Travis Barker, Sheila E., and Robert Glasper. Rapper D-Nice
                          served as an in-house DJ during the gala.[39] As part of a continued focus on enhancing inclusion
                          and accommodations for disabilities, the Academy offered a live feed of American Sign Language
                          (ASL) interpretation for the ceremony through the Academy Awards' YouTube channel.[40] In June
                          2020, the Academy announced that, starting with the 94th awards, a fixed number of ten films would
                          once again be nominated for Best Picture.[41] According to The Hollywood Reporter, this rule change
                          was initiated in order "to maximize the diversity of the films that are nominated for the Academy's
                          highest honor" as part of the organization's Academy Aperture 2025 equity and inclusion
                          initiative.[42] Previously, AMPAS had experimented with a ten-film Best Picture slate for two years
                          beginning with the 82nd ceremony in 2010 before changing the rules two years later so that a
                          fluctuating number of films would be nominated depending on the nomination voting results.[43]

                          Scherm’s prose is not especially stylish—there is a description of Mary Agnes curled up “like a
                          shrimp” which made me physically frown—but it is sturdy enough to carry the story halfway to the
                          moon nonetheless, and briskly paced. A House Between Earth and the Moon, out this week, synthesizes
                          genres to create something new. Part ensemble family drama, part coming-of-age story, part social
                          novel, part cli-fi, it’s original and affecting not despite its overstuffed melange of big ideas
                          but because of how deftly Scherm weaves them together. It could be subtitled Everything Happens So
                          Much. Mary Agnes, the youngest point-of-view character, is the novel’s bruised heart. A lonely
                          nerd, she is elated when her father’s space travels make some of her school’s popular crew notice
                          her. Even in the future, though, the in-crowd sucks, and Mary Agnes’ charming crush turns out to
                          have a sadistic streak sharpened by technology. The screen-addled, empathy-deficient teenagers are
                          reminiscent of the jerky crew of M.T. Anderson’s prescient Feed, and Mary Agnes’ story reads like
                          an especially observant young-adult novella braided throughout the book. (Her younger brother
                          Shane, alas, doesn’t get a similarly compelling storyline. His only personality trait seems to be
                          “allergic to everything.

                          by Covid restrictions, supply chain snarls, semiconductor chip and other parts shortages. Last
                          year, Tesla delivered 201,250 vehicles in the second quarter, its first time delivering more than
                          200,000 units in a three-month period. In the first quarter of 2022, Tesla delivered 310,048

                          Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Tesla delivered a record number of cars last year, as
                          sales continued to grow by percentages any other major automaker would dream about. But Tesla still
                          managed to disappoint Wall Street throughout 2022 – and the last quarter was no different. The
                          electric automaker delivered 1.3 million vehicles in 2022, up 40% from 2021. It produced nearly 1.4
                          million vehicles, up 47% from the prior year. Yet the fourth quarter underwhelmed: Tesla delivered
                          only 405,278 vehicles, well below the median estimate of 431,000 according to analysts polled by
                          Refinitiv, as recession fears and higher interest rates led to a slowdown in demand. Although 40%
                          growth is nothing to sneeze at, Tesla’s pace of growth is slowing. Deliveries nearly doubled in
                          2021 and more than quadrupled in 2020. Tesla’s (TSLA) stock plunged 65% in 2022 as demand weakened.
                          Competition in electric vehicles from established automakers surged last year. The company missed
                          its growth targets throughout the year and it scaled back production in China. Evidence of car
                          buyers’ sinking interest in Teslas became apparent last month after the company announced a rare
                          sale in a bid to clear out inventory.

                          April 2 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) on Sunday posted record quarterly vehicle deliveries, but
                          quarter-on-quarter sales growth was modest despite price cuts as rising competition and a bleak
                          economic outlook weighed. Tesla delivered 422,875 vehicles for the first three months of this year,
                          up 4% from the previous quarter. This was 36% higher than a year ago. In January, Chief Executive
                          Elon Musk said Tesla could achieve 2 million vehicle deliveries this year, up 52% from last year.
                          Investors have been watching Musk's gamble that cutting prices would stimulate sales, although they
                          worry about eroding margins. In January, Tesla slashed prices globally by as much as 20%,

                          that used to sell for $65,990 now costs $54,990. "If they wouldn't have done the price cut, it

                          director of equity research at Wedbush, an investment firm, told ABC News the grievance could serve
                          as a pretext for Musk to renegotiate or abandon the deal amid a market downturn that had proven
                          especially pronounced for tech stocks. Over the course of the saga, Musk has been cast as a suitor,
                          critic and legal adversary of Twitter, where he boasts 115 million followers. Below is a timeline
                          of Musk's bid to acquire the social media platform, and what has happened since he took ownership.
                          Late January – Musk begins investing in Twitter, according to information filed with the Securities
                          and Exchange Commission in April. March 14 – Musk's stake in Twitter reaches 9.2%, making him the
                          largest shareholder in the company, according to a securities filing. April 4 – In a securities
                          filing, Musk discloses his stake in Twitter. Based on the price of Twitter shares at close of the
                          previous trading day, his stake was worth $2.89 billion. Twitter shares rise more than 27% on the
                          announcement. April 5 – Twitter announces Musk will join the company's board of directors. "He's
                          both a passionate believer and intense critic of the service which is exactly what we need on
                          @Twitter, and in the boardroom, to make us stronger in the long-term," Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal
                          said on the platform.

Question 50              : How much did Elon Musk bought Twitter?
Correct Answers         :  
                          44 billion
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prediction (only positive):
  - Answer              :  $44 billion
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          At least one of the executives who was fired was escorted out of Twitter’s office, they said. Mr.
                          Musk, who is one of Twitter’s most active users and has more than 109 million followers, began
                          accumulating shares in the company this year. In April, he struck the deal to buy the company for
                          $44 billion and said he would lift Twitter’s content moderation policies, eliminate spam, add new
                          features and provide more transparency about the algorithms used to promote content. “Twitter has
                          tremendous potential — I look forward to working with the company and the community of users to
                          unlock it,” he said in a statement in April. But, within weeks, he began questioning the deal. Mr.
                          Musk lashed out at the Twitter executives responsible for content decisions and accused the company
                          of failing to accurately count the spam accounts on its platform. When Parag Agrawal, Twitter’s
                          chief executive, tried debunking Mr. Musk’s claims, Mr. Musk responded by tweeting a poop emoji. By
                          July, Mr. Musk had decided that he no longer wanted to own Twitter, arguing that he had been misled
                          about the amount of spam on the platform. He announced his intent to abandon the acquisition.
                          Twitter sued Mr. Musk to force him to carry out the agreement. The company accused Mr. Musk of
                          trying to back out of the deal because the economic downturn had caused a decline in his personal
                          wealth. Mr. Musk had agreed to personally provide roughly $33 billion of the $44 billion deal.

                          on April 14, 2022, and concluded it on October 27, 2022. Musk had begun buying shares of the
                          company in January 2022, becoming its largest shareholder by April with a 9.1 percent ownership
                          stake. Twitter invited Musk to join its board of directors, an offer he initially accepted before
                          declining. On April 14, Musk made an unsolicited offer to purchase the company, to which Twitter's
                          board initially responded with a "poison pill" strategy to resist a hostile takeover, before
                          unanimously accepting Musk's buyout offer of $44 billion on April 25. Musk stated that he planned
                          to introduce new features to the platform, make its algorithms open-source, combat spambot
                          accounts, and promote free speech. In July, Musk announced his intention to terminate the
                          agreement, asserting that Twitter had breached their agreement by refusing to crack down on spambot
                          accounts. The company filed a lawsuit against Musk in the Delaware Court of Chancery shortly
                          thereafter, with a trial scheduled for the week of October 17. Weeks before the trial was set to
                          begin, Musk reversed course, announcing that he would move forward with the acquisition. The deal
                          was closed on October 27, with Musk immediately becoming Twitter's new owner and CEO. Twitter was
                          taken private and merged into a new parent company named X Corp.

Question 52              : Who won the women's singles Australian Open 2022?
Correct Answers         :  
                          Ashleigh Barty
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prediction (only positive):

                          The 2022 Australian Open was a Grand Slam tennis tournament that took place at Melbourne Park,
                          Australia from 17 to 30 January 2022.[2] It was the 110th edition of the Australian Open, the 54th
                          in the Open Era, and the first Grand Slam of the year. The tournament consisted of events for
                          professional players in singles, doubles and mixed doubles. Junior and wheelchair players competed
                          in singles and doubles tournaments. As in previous years, the tournament's main sponsor was Kia.
                          The men's singles title was won by Rafael Nadal, and was Nadal's 21st major title, and his second
                          Australian Open. He defeated second seed Daniil Medvedev in the final, winning in five sets after
                          being two sets down. In winning the title, Nadal broke the record for all-time men's major singles
                          title - it was previously tied at 20 between himself, Novak Djokovic, and Roger Federer. The
                          women's singles title was won by Ashleigh Barty, who won her first Australian Open title and third
                          major title. She defeated 27th seed Danielle Collins in straight sets. Barty was the first
                          Australian to win the title since Chris O'Neil won the title in 1978. The final would also prove to
                          be Barty's last professional match, with Barty announcing her retirement in March 2022.

                          Advertisement Supported by The 24-year-old Belarusian player pushed Elena Rybakina of Kazakhstan to
                          three sets to capture her first Grand Slam singles title. By Matthew Futterman Reporting from
                          Melbourne, Australia Aryna Sabalenka is no longer afraid of big stages. Overcoming a history of
                          buckling under the pressure of late-round Grand Slam tennis, Sabalenka, the powerful 24-year-old
                          from Belarus, came from behind to beat Elena Rybakina of Kazakhstan 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 in the women’s
                          singles final of the Australian Open on Saturday. In a matchup of two of the biggest hitters in the
                          sport, Sabalenka was a little more fearless and a few clicks more clinical than Rybakina in the
                          crucial moments to cap off a dominant summer of tennis in Australia. It was Sabalenka’s first Grand
                          Slam title in a rocky career that has included the kind of error-ridden, big-moment meltdowns from
                          which some players almost never recover. Instead, the match proved a microcosm of Sabalenka’s
                          career — a shaky start, filled with ill-timed double faults followed by a steadying midmatch
                          recovery before a final-set display of raw power and precision that her opponent could not answer.
                          And it all went down after Sabalenka decided last year to make a contrarian move in an era when
                          athletes train their minds as hard as they train their bodies.

                          tennis title at the 2023 Australian Open. It was her first major singles title.[1] Sabalenka
                          dropped just one set during the tournament, to Rybakina in the championship match. Rybakina became

                          Open.[2] By reaching the final, Rybakina made her debut in the top ten of the WTA Rankings.

                          2022.[4] Barty's retirement and Angelique Kerber and Naomi Osaka’s absences (both due to pregnancy)

                          trophy in the men's draw — a trophy won by only four different players since 2004. Iga Swiatek,
                          Barbora Krejcikova and Jelena Ostapenko are hoping to repeat their past triumphs in the women's
                          singles when the action begins on May 28. Australian Open champion Aryna Sabalenka and men's world
                          No.1 Carlos Alcaraz are among the players hoping to go all the way at Roland-Garros for the first
                          time. Whose footsteps will the champions be following? Here's who won last year and a list of

                          singles title? Rafael Nadal was the 2022 French Open champion, winning his 22nd and most recent
                          grand slam title. Novak Djokovic ended Nadal's run of five straight French Opens in 2021 but the
                          Spanish superstar returned to beat his arch-rival in four sets in the quarterfinals in last year. A
                          brutal mid-match injury to Alexander Zverev sent Nadal through to a final he won in straight sets
                          against Casper Ruud, extending his record to 14 French Open titles and 22 majors in total.

                          The 2022 French Open was a Grand Slam tennis tournament played on outdoor clay courts. It was held
                          at the Stade Roland Garros in Paris, France, from 22 May to 5 June 2022, comprising singles,
                          doubles and mixed doubles play. Junior and wheelchair tournaments are also scheduled. Novak
                          Djokovic was the defending champion in men's singles, and Barbora Krejčíková was the defending
                          champion in the women's singles.[1] Neither successfully defended their title, with Djokovic losing
                          in the quarter-finals to Rafael Nadal, and Krejčíková losing in the first round to Diane Parry. The
                          event returned to its full spectator capacity after the last two editions due to COVID-19
                          restrictions in France. It was the 126th edition of the French Open and the second Grand Slam event
                          of 2022. The main singles draws included 16 qualifiers for men and 16 for women out of 128 players
                          in each draw. It was part of the 2022 ATP Tour and the 2022 WTA Tour. It was also the first edition
                          of the tournament to feature a super tie break in the final set where the player would win first to
                          ten points as rules are now applied in Wimbledon and US Open.[2]

                          This was the first Grand Slam tournament since the international governing bodies of tennis allowed
                          players from Russia and Belarus to continue to participate in tennis events, but not compete under
                          the name or flags of Russia and Belarus until further notice, due to the 2022 Russian invasion of
                          Ukraine.[3][4] The men's singles title was won for the 14th time by Rafael Nadal, who won his 22nd
                          Grand Slam title. He defeated eighth seed Casper Ruud, who was playing his first grand slam final,
                          in straight sets. In winning the title, Nadal extended his record of most titles per tournament at
                          the French Open, and also extended his all-time men's record of major singles titles to 22. The
                          women's singles title was won by Iga Świątek, who won her second French Open and second grand slam
                          title, having won her first at the 2020 French Open. She defeated 18th seed Coco Gauff, who was
                          also playing her first grand slam final, in straight sets. In winning the title, Świątek became the
                          youngest winner of multiple majors since Maria Sharapova's win at the 2006 US Open. As a Grand Slam
                          tournament, the points for the French Open are the highest of all ATP and WTA tournaments.[5] These
                          points determine the world ATP and WTA rankings for men's and women's competition, respectively.

                          The 2022 French Open was a Grand Slam tennis tournament played on outdoor clay courts. It was held
                          at the Stade Roland Garros in Paris, France, from 22 May to 5 June 2022, comprising singles,
                          doubles and mixed doubles play. Junior and wheelchair tournaments are also scheduled. Novak
                          Djokovic was the defending champion in men's singles, and Barbora Krejčíková was the defending
                          champion in the women's singles.[1] Neither successfully defended their title, with Djokovic losing
                          in the quarter-finals to Rafael Nadal, and Krejčíková losing in the first round to Diane Parry. The
                          event returned to its full spectator capacity after the last two editions due to COVID-19
                          restrictions in France. It was the 126th edition of the French Open and the second Grand Slam event
                          of 2022. The main singles draws included 16 qualifiers for men and 16 for women out of 128 players
                          in each draw. It was part of the 2022 ATP Tour and the 2022 WTA Tour. It was also the first edition
                          of the tournament to feature a super tie break in the final set where the player would win first to
                          ten points as rules are now applied in Wimbledon and US Open.[2]

                          Rafael Nadal.[1] With the victory, Djokovic became the first man to achieve a triple career Grand
                          Slam, and became the oldest French Open champion at the age of 36 years and 20 days.[2] Nadal was

                          out of the top 100 of the ATP rankings for the first time since 2003.[5] By winning the title,
                          Djokovic reclaimed the world No. 1 singles ranking from Carlos Alcaraz; Daniil Medvedev and
                          Stefanos Tsitsipas were also in contention for the top ranking at the beginning of the
                          tournament.[6][7] Medvedev's loss to Thiago Seyboth Wild in the first round marked the first time

                          her title after retiring from professional tennis in March 2022.[3] The ladies' singles title was
                          won by Elena Rybakina, who defeated Ons Jabeur in the final.[4] This year, the AELTC barred Russian

                          "I made a bet with my coach. He said that if I won a Grand Slam he was going to get one (a tattoo)
                          also. I think we are going to go tomorrow!" Vondrousova is the fourth Czech - after Martina
                          Navratilova, Jana Novotna and Petra Kvitova - to win the Wimbledon women's singles title. After
                          holding serve without too many issues in the opening game, Jabeur converted her second break point
                          to take a 2-0 lead with the Centre Court roof closed due to high winds. But the sixth seed from
                          Tunisia appeared to struggle with the lack of pace on shots coming from the other side of the net,
                          certainly compared to reigning champion Elena Rybakina and Aryna Sabalenka who she had beaten in
                          her previous two matches. A nervy-looking Vondrousova broke back for 1-2 before a lengthy fourth
                          game, with both players showing their subtlety and variation, which eventually yielded the Czech's
                          first service hold of the match. Jabeur then broke to love to lead 4-2 and seemingly take a grip on
                          the first set.

                          The 2022 Wimbledon Championships was a Grand Slam tier tennis tournament that took place at the All
                          England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club in Wimbledon, London, United Kingdom. Novak Djokovic
                          successfully defended his gentlemen's singles title to claim his 21st major title, defeating Nick
                          Kyrgios in the final.[1][2] Ashleigh Barty was the reigning ladies' champion, but did not defend
                          her title after retiring from professional tennis in March 2022.[3] The ladies' singles title was
                          won by Elena Rybakina, who defeated Ons Jabeur in the final.[4] This year, the AELTC barred Russian
                          and Belarusian players from competing because of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In reaction, the
                          WTA, ATP, and ITF withdrew ranking points from the tournament. The tournament was played on grass
                          courts, with all main draw matches played at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club,
                          Wimbledon from 27 June to 10 July 2022. Initial wild card entries were first announced on 14 June
                          2022.[5] Qualifying matches were played from 20 June to 23 June 2022 at the Bank of England Sports
                          Ground in Roehampton.[citation needed] The 2022 championships were the 135th edition, the 128th
                          staging of the ladies’ singles championship event, the 54th in the Open Era, and the third Grand
                          Slam tournament of the year.

                          In the most high-pressure situation of the match yet, Djokovic’s experience showed as he raced into
                          a big lead, not giving it up as he claimed a remarkable seventh Wimbledon title. Afterwards,
                          Kyrgios was full of praise for Djokovic, despite their past differences, calling him a “bit of a
                          god.” However, when he was asked whether reaching his first grand slam final had made him hungry
                          for more, Kyrgios was emphatic. “Absolutely not! I’m so tired honestly. Myself, my team, we’re all
                          exhausted. We’ve played so much tennis,” he told Sue Barker on Centre Court. “I’m really happy with
                          this result and maybe one day I’ll be here again but I don’t know about that.” © 2023 Cable News

                          The couple were planning to celebrate their first wedding anniversary on Sunday with a special date
                          at the Champions Dinner. Ms Vondrousova's best run at Wimbledon prior to this year had been in 2021
                          when she lost to Emma Raducanu in the second round. Her game, though, built on touch, slice and
                          angles rather than power, is a good fit for grass, making this victory slightly less unexpected
                          than at first glance. She credits an early coach and her slightness of stature for the way her game
                          has developed, saying: 'I had one coach in my home town who taught me how to slice and everything.
                          'I just feel like I was always the smallest one and I just didn't have that much power, so I had to

                          6 seed Ons Jabeur. Its only the second WTA tour win for Vondroušová -- her first since 2017 --
                          who'll move to No. 10 in the WTA rankings with the win. Jabeur, meanwhile is the runner up at
                          Wimbledon for a second straight year, and has lost all three of her career Grand Slam finals.
                          Djokovic didn't walk away with a trophy, but the 23-time Grand Slam champion was still able to add
                          more achievements to his already impressive resume at Wimbledon. With his second-round victory
                          against Jordan Thompson, Djokovic became one of only three players in tennis history with 350 wins
                          in Grand Slam singles matches -- joining Serena Williams and Rafael Nadal. After taking down No. 7
                          Andrey Rublev in Tuesday's quarterfinals, Djokovic reached a major semifinal for the 46th time in
                          his career, tying Roger Federer's all-time men's record. This year's Wimbledon has had headlines
                          that are not all about the game. The All England Club increased security after protesters had been
                          disrupting other events in England, however, two climate protesters still managed to interrupt the
                          first-round match between Sho Shimabukuro and Grigor Dimitrov. Two people were arrested after they
                          threw orange-colored confetti and jigsaw puzzle pieces onto Court 18.

Question 67              : Who won the men's singles U.S. Open 2022?
Correct Answers         :  
                          Carlos Alcaraz

  - Answer              : Carlos Alcaraz
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          Carlos Alcaraz defeated Casper Ruud in the final, 6–4, 2–6, 7–6(7–1), 6–3 to win the men's singles
                          tennis title at the 2022 US Open. It was his first major title, and he claimed the world No. 1
                          singles ranking with the win.[1] Ruud, Rafael Nadal, Daniil Medvedev, and Stefanos Tsitsipas were
                          also in contention for the top position.[2] Alcaraz saved a match point en route to the title, in
                          the quarterfinals against Jannik Sinner.[3] Alcaraz became the youngest major champion since Nadal
                          at the 2005 French Open, the youngest US Open champion since Pete Sampras in 1990, the first man
                          born in the 2000s to win a major singles title, and the youngest man to be ranked world No. 1 in
                          tennis history, surpassing the record Lleyton Hewitt held.[4] Alcaraz also became the third player
                          to reach a major final having won three consecutive five-set matches, after Stefan Edberg at the
                          1992 US Open and Andre Agassi at the 2005 US Open.[5] At 23 hours and 39 minutes of play duration
                          across his seven matches, Alcaraz spent the longest time on court in major history.

                          He sprinted from one corner of the court to the other, from the back wall to the edge of the net,
                          whipping and spinning balls, and tantalizing and wowing a crowd sprinkled with the usual cast of
                          celebrities befitting the final round. Years from now, the likes of Jerry Seinfeld, Anna Wintour,
                          Questlove and Christie Brinkley can tell friends they were there when the teenager won his first
                          Grand Slam title. The championship came at the end of an epic week for Alcaraz. Just to get to the
                          final, he played three straight five-set matches, starting Monday, that had him on the court for
                          some 15 hours. His quarterfinal victory over Jannik Sinner, during which he was one point from
                          elimination, lasted until 2:50 a.m. on Thursday, the latest finish in the history of a tournament
                          notorious for late endings. Two nights later, or rather, the next night, he outlasted Tiafoe in
                          emotional, battle-filled, lung-busting rallies in a match with miraculous point-saving shots to the
                          end. “I’ve never played a player who moves as well,” said Tiafoe, who has played the best of the
                          best. “He’s going to be a problem for a very long time.” Alcaraz, though, said his first chance at
                          a Grand Slam final was no time to be tired, and he started causing problems for Ruud early.

Question 68              : Who is the new head coach of the Virginia Tech football team in 2022?
Correct Answers         :  
                          Brent Pry

  - Source              :
                          That’s a battle that neither side is likely to win, nor compromise on, either. Look, no one is
                          fooling anyone. If someone said upon the prior regime departing, that Brent Pry was going to be the
                          head coach of the 2022 and beyond (however long “beyond is”) Virginia Tech Hokies football program,
                          you’d have been laughed out of the room. Who? For Defensive Coordinator, maybe? And why would he
                          take that demotion? The reality (again we return to “reality”) is that only two or three coaches on
                          this staff have experience at the levels at which they are performing; JC Price and Joe Rudolph are
                          performing parallel jobs. Everyone else is subject to the “Peter Principle”. I don’t normally sight
                          Wikipedia but this works fine. That includes the Head Coach, the Offensive Coordinator, the
                          Defensive Coordinator, and the Special Teams Coach. Well, gee isn’t that really everyone who
                          counts. That’s an affirmative. Another “reality” is called for, here. Whit Babcock is taking a very
                          calculated risk. He did the “safe” and expected thing before and was burned. This time he’s gone
                          ahead and dived into the tank headfirst without testing the water. At mid-season of the first year,
                          it’s not expected that very much will be done until after December, but there are indications that
                          some of the subjects are perilously close to the operational disaster outlined in the definition of
                          the “Peter Principle”.

                          For those wondering, the points came from all over the place: multiple magazines, lots of
                          bloggers—Blind Man’s Puff had three Knuckle Sandwich cigars on its list—and plenty of YouTubers. I
                          removed the category from the spreadsheet that tracked whether a cigar was new, though not before I
                          did most of that work. This was becoming overly complicated for several reasons—did the SakaKhan
                          come out in 2021 or 2022—and I’m not sure what value it had. It’s been replaced by a category that
                          I think is far more interesting. How many lists does this cigar appear as the #1 on? Because some
                          publications will have two different lists—usually multiple people’s lists are presented, meaning
                          there are two #1s, two #2s, etc.—this could get rather complicated. Furthermore, I was more curious
                          about the undisputed status, so that’s what I measured. Congrats to the following blends that

                          The 2022 Kentucky Derby (officially, the 148th Running of the Kentucky Derby Presented by Woodford
                          Reserve[1]) took place on Saturday, May 7, 2022, at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky. It was
                          the 148th running of the Kentucky Derby, a 1+1⁄4 miles (2.0 km) Grade I stakes race for
                          three-year-old Thoroughbreds. The Derby is held annually at Churchill Downs on the first Saturday
                          in May since its inception in 1875. The 20 horses that ran in the Derby qualified by earning points
                          in the 2022 Road to the Kentucky Derby. The two favorites for the 2022 Kentucky Derby were
                          Epicenter, the winner of the Louisiana Derby, and Zandon, the winner of the Blue Grass Stakes. Both
                          horses finished behind winner Rich Strike, who had only entered the race after a late scratch.
                          Entering the race at odds of 80–1, Rich Strike's victory was the second-largest upset in Derby
                          history. It was the first Kentucky Derby victory for his trainer Eric Reed, as well as the first
                          graded stakes win in any race for his jockey Sonny Leon. Participation in the Kentucky Derby is
                          restricted to three-year-old Thoroughbreds.

                          The 148th running of the Kentucky Derby will take place Saturday at Churchill Downs in Louisville,
                          Kentucky. Zandon, leaving from the 10 post, opened as the 3-1 morning-line favorite after Derby
                          post positions were released Monday, followed closely by Epicenter at 7-2 from the third position.
                          Post time for Saturday's one and one-quarter mile race is 6:57 p.m. ET. In last year's edition of
                          the Run for the Roses, Medina Spirit crossed the finish line first, which appeared to have given
                          trainer Bob Baffert a record seventh win in the race and jockey John Velazquez his fourth Derby
                          win. However, the horse tested positive for a banned race-day substance and the Kentucky Horse
                          Racing Commission stripped Medina Spirit of his Derby title in February. With Medina Spirit's win

                          The 148th running of the Kentucky Derby will take place Saturday at Churchill Downs in Louisville,
                          Kentucky. Zandon, leaving from the 10 post, opened as the 3-1 morning-line favorite after Derby
                          post positions were released Monday, followed closely by Epicenter at 7-2 from the third position.
                          Post time for Saturday's one and one-quarter mile race is 6:57 p.m. ET. In last year's edition of
                          the Run for the Roses, Medina Spirit crossed the finish line first, which appeared to have given
                          trainer Bob Baffert a record seventh win in the race and jockey John Velazquez his fourth Derby
                          win. However, the horse tested positive for a banned race-day substance and the Kentucky Horse
                          Racing Commission stripped Medina Spirit of his Derby title in February. With Medina Spirit's win
                          vacated, second-place finisher Mandaloun improved to first place. Here are the morning-line odds
                          for the 2022 Kentucky Derby, in order of post position (with trainer and jockey): Trainer: Todd
                          Pletcher Jockey: Irad Ortiz Jr. Trainer: Doug O'Neill Jockey: Rafael Bejarano Trainer: Steve
                          Asmussen Jockey: Joel Rosario Trainer: Bhupat Seemar Jockey: Mikael Barzalona Trainer: Ken McPeek

                          Tesla just reported first-quarter earnings for 2022 and beat analysts' expectations on the top and
                          bottom lines. Here are the key numbers. Shares rose as high as 6% in after-hours trading.
                          Automotive revenue reached $16.86 billion, up 87% from the same period last year. Automotive gross
                          margins jumped to a record 32.9% with Tesla reporting gross profit of $5.54 billion in its main
                          segment. Regulatory credits accounted for $679 million of automotive revenue for the quarter.
                          Revenue growth was driven in part by an increase in the number of cars Tesla delivered, and an
                          increase in average sales prices, the company said in its shareholder deck.

  - Source              :
                          On 25 August 2022, Nintendo Treehouse showed off some gameplay of the game's story mode, such as
                          the reveal of the first level of Future Utopia Island, Get to Know Alterna, Your Only Choice. On 27
                          August 2022, the Splatoon 3 Splatfest World Premiere was started at different time zones with 26
                          weapons to use and a variety of different gear to wear. A single Splatfest took place in the demo,
                          the theme of which was Rock vs. Paper vs. Scissors. After the Splatfest's results were announced,
                          the demo ended. On 9 September 2022, Splatoon 3 was released. The game takes place 5 years after
                          the events of Splatoon 2 in the Splatlands, a sun-scorched desert inhabited by battle-hardened
                          Inklings and Octolings, and Splatsville, a city of chaos that developed rapidly since the last
                          Splatfest of Splatoon 2, Chaos vs. Order.[10] The game's design is themed around chaos due to the
                          outcome of the Splatfest.[11] The Splatoon 3 single-player story mode is called "Return of the
                          Mammalians". Octarians return as the primary enemies, but the majority of them now appear mutated
                          with brown fur and purple eyes.

                          himself that another Holocaust should never be allowed to occur.[164] Despite their political
                          differences, Hatch was a longtime friend of fellow senator Ted Kennedy,[165] spoke at his memorial
                          service in 2009,[166] and publicly suggested Kennedy's widow, Victoria Reggie, as a replacement for
                          Kennedy in the Senate.[167] Hatch died in Salt Lake City on April 23, 2022, aged 88, from
                          complications of a stroke he had the week prior.[1][168] He was buried in Newton.[169] Hatch played
                          the piano, violin, and organ. Fueled by his interest in poetry, Hatch composed songs for many
                          artists. One of his songs, "Unspoken", went platinum after appearing on WOW Hits 2005, a
                          compilation of Christian pop music.[170] He co-authored "Everything And More", sung by Billy

                          musical recording artist.[171] Rock musician Frank Zappa composed a guitar instrumental entitled
                          "Orrin Hatch On Skis", which appears on his 1988 album, Guitar.[172] In March 1997, Hatch and

                          from 1977 to 2019, including time as the president pro tempore of the chamber, a ceremonial
                          leadership position typically reserved for senior members. He was known for working across the

                          came out of political nowhere to win a U.S. Senate seat in 1976 and ended his career 42 years later
                          as the longest-serving Republican in the chamber’s history and one of his party’s most influential
                          lawmakers of recent decades, died April 23 in Salt Lake City. He was 88. The death was announced by
                          the Hatch Foundation. The cause was not immediately disclosed. Tall and slim in build and
                          impeccable in dress, Mr. Hatch had a gentlemanly demeanor but behind it wielded strong views, high
                          energy and a love for legislative give-and-take that made him a force on Capitol Hill. When he

                          than any other senator in office at the time, according to Library of Congress data. He achieved
                          that record in part through his willingness to work with liberal Democrats. “He was a tough
                          partisan, a solid conservative, but he could make strategic alliances to get legislation passed,”
                          former Senate historian Donald Ritchie said in an interview. “No one questioned his ideology, so he
                          could deal.

                          The final death knell was a devastating 15,000-word profile in The Atlantic that published on
                          Friday. The blistering piece, in which author Tim Alberta spoke to more than 100 CNN employees,
                          called into serious question Licht’s ability to lead the organization into the future. In the wake
                          of The Atlantic article, Licht attempted to regain his footing. He apologized to staffers and vowed
                          to “fight like hell” to win over the trust of employees. But it became increasingly clear that
                          Licht’s tenure as the chief executive was not tenable and quickly coming to an end. High-profile
                          anchors and correspondents, in addition the the rank-and-file staff, had hit the wall with Licht.
                          The CNN chief had, in effect, lost the room. The picture quickly became clear to Zaslav, who
                          installed his top lieutenant, David Leavy, as CNN’s chief operating officer last week. Over the
                          weekend, after The Atlantic story crystallized concerns that Zaslav had with Licht’s leadership
                          over the last several months, the Warner Bros. Discovery chief started seriously considering
                          relieving him of his duties, a person familiar with the matter said. It had become evident that
                          Licht, suffering from a series of self-inflicted wounds, could no longer lead the company. The
                          final decision to remove Licht was ultimately made by Zaslav earlier this week, the person said.

Question 77              : What is the megapixel in main camera on the iPhone 14 Pro?

  - Source              :
                          Well ahead of Apple’s event last month, there had been rumors that this long era — 7 years is a
                          practical century in technology time — was about to come to an end. Indeed, iPhone 14 Pro was
                          announced with a 48 megapixel camera. Looking purely at the specs, it’s an impressive upgrade: the
                          sensor is significantly larger in size, not just resolution. The lens is slightly slower (that is,
                          its aperture isn’t quite as large as the previous years’) but once again, the overall
                          light-gathering ability of the iPhone’s main shooter improves by as much as 33%. The implications
                          are clear: more pixels for more resolution; more light gathered for better low light shots, and
                          finally, a bigger sensor for improvements in all areas including more shallow depth of field.
                          There’s a reason we chase the dragon of larger sensors in cameras; they allow for all our favorite
                          photography subjects: details, low light and night shots, and nice bokeh. Your average digital
                          camera sensor has a particularly interesting way to capture color. We’ve previously detailed this
                          in our post about ProRAW, which you can read here, but we’ll quickly go over it again. Essentially,
                          a camera sensor contains tiny pixels that can detect how much light comes in. For a dark area of an
                          image, it will register darkness accurately, and vice versa for lighter areas.

                          Apple did not go into great detail about the camera hardware changes here, but thankfully
                          Techinsights took the entire camera package apart. The new sensor, at 40mm², is almost 50% larger
                          than the iPhone 13 Pro’s 26.9 mm² sensor. While its aperture is slightly ‘slower’ (that is,
                          smaller) the larger sensor compensates. How does the sensor and lens change stack up in practice?
                          The iPhone 14 Pro easily outperforms the previous iPhone, creating far sharper shots: In multiple
                          shots in various conditions, the shots were far more detailed and exhibited less visible processing
                          than comparable iPhone 13 Pro shots: A nice side benefit of a larger sensor is a bit more shallow
                          depth of field. At a 13mm full-frame equivalent, you really can’t expect too much subject
                          separation, but this shot shows some nice blurry figures in the background. I believe that both
                          Apple’s new Photonic Engine and the larger sensor are contributing to a lot more detail in the
                          frame, which makes a cropped image like the above shot possible. The ‘my point of view’ perspective

                          still fairly soft and lacking detail. Its 12 megapixel resolution is suddenly feeling almost
                          restrictive.

                          Well ahead of Apple’s event last month, there had been rumors that this long era — 7 years is a
                          practical century in technology time — was about to come to an end. Indeed, iPhone 14 Pro was
                          announced with a 48 megapixel camera. Looking purely at the specs, it’s an impressive upgrade: the
                          sensor is significantly larger in size, not just resolution. The lens is slightly slower (that is,
                          its aperture isn’t quite as large as the previous years’) but once again, the overall
                          light-gathering ability of the iPhone’s main shooter improves by as much as 33%. The implications
                          are clear: more pixels for more resolution; more light gathered for better low light shots, and
                          finally, a bigger sensor for improvements in all areas including more shallow depth of field.
                          There’s a reason we chase the dragon of larger sensors in cameras; they allow for all our favorite
                          photography subjects: details, low light and night shots, and nice bokeh. Your average digital
                          camera sensor has a particularly interesting way to capture color. We’ve previously detailed this
                          in our post about ProRAW, which you can read here, but we’ll quickly go over it again. Essentially,
                          a camera sensor contains tiny pixels that can detect how much light comes in. For a dark area of an
                          image, it will register darkness accurately, and vice versa for lighter areas.

                          Taiyab said he applauded Apple for trying to empower iPhone owners but had a harsh verdict. “They
                          set up the customer to fail,” he said. The self-repair program, I concluded, is impractical for
                          most people. For starters, the cost of renting the equipment and purchasing parts from Apple — $96
                          to replace my iPhone 12’s battery — was more than the $69 an Apple store charges to do the job. And
                          as my experience shows, the process was challenging even with Apple’s tools. Apple discourages most
                          people from trying self-repair. “For the vast majority of customers, the safest and most reliable
                          repair is achieved through an Apple Store” and thousands of authorized repair centers, the company
                          said in a white paper last month. “Repairing modern electronic devices that are complex, highly
                          integrated and miniaturized isn’t easy.” This raises the question of why Apple rolled out the
                          self-repair program in the first place. It is probably no coincidence that it made the move after
                          the Federal Trade Commission said last year that it would ramp up enforcement against tech
                          companies that made it hard for people to fix their electronics. And now, my tale of defeat. I
                          started by visiting Apple’s self-repair program website, selfservicerepair.com. There I found the
                          service manual for the iPhone 12 I wanted to repair and ordered the tools. (Apple’s program
                          currently includes manuals for iPhones released in the last two years.

                          Watch CBS News By Christopher Brito June 15, 2022 / 10:40 AM / CBS News Netflix announced on
                          Tuesday it is launching a reality competition series based on the hit show, "Squid Game." The
                          streaming service is offering a $4.56 million as the reward, which it says is the "largest cast and
                          lump sum cash prize in reality TV history." In a news release, Netflix said 456 players will enter
                          "Squid Game: The Challenge," and compete in a series of games inspired by the show, with
                          "surprising new additions." And unlike the original Netflix show where contestants are eliminated
                          through death, the company said the "worst fate is going home empty-handed" in this game. "Squid
                          Game" centers around contestants with dire financial struggles hoping to win billions of dollars
                          competing against each other in typical South Korean children's games. It became an international
                          sensation, and it holds the record as Netflix's most popular series of all-time, according to the
                          company. The show had over 1.65 billion viewing hours in the first 28 days after it premiered in
                          September. The show was renewed for a second season on Sunday.

                          Netflix is recruiting participants for a reality TV show inspired by its most popular series of all
                          time, Squid Game. However, it will not be life or death that is at stake, as depicted in the South
                          Korean dystopian drama. Instead, 456 recruits from around the world will play games where "the
                          worst fate is going home empty-handed" - missing out on a $4.56m (£3.8m) prize. Netflix also
                          confirmed that the popular series would be renewed for a second season earlier this week. On
                          Wednesday, the platform announced that its new 10-episode series - Squid Game: The Challenge -
                          would offer the "largest cast and lump cash prize in reality TV history". "As [players] compete
                          through a series of games inspired by the original show - plus surprising new additions - their
                          strategies, alliances, and character will be put to the test while competitors are eliminated
                          around them," it added. Participants need to be at least 21 years old. They must speak English, and
                          be available for up to 4 weeks in early 2023 for filming. The 456 participants are a nod to the
                          fictional series, which features the same number of players, with its main protagonist Seong Gi-hun
                          also referred to as Player 456. The South Korean thriller series tells the story of debt-ridden
                          people competing for a huge cash prize in a deadly series of children's games.

                          These missions are only available as free-to-play game modes during specific seasons, but Blizzard
                          will offer to buy permanent access to these missions separately or as part of a battle pass
                          bundle.[11] Overwatch 2 was announced at BlizzCon on November 1, 2019, with plans that the game
                          would maintain a "shared multiplayer environment" between it and the original Overwatch, so that
                          players in either game could compete in the existing player versus player (PvP) game modes,
                          retaining all unlocked cosmetics and other features.[12] Jeff Kaplan, director for Overwatch,
                          explained that this was a major decision and that he had to justify this "player-first standpoint"
                          to Blizzard executives, given the current industry trend to draw in new sales.[13] All new heroes,
                          maps, and PvP modes were to be added to both games to maintain this shared environment.[14]
                          However, Overwatch 2 was later announced as a free-to-play title, and that on its release on
                          October 4, 2022, Blizzard affirmed that Overwatch 2 live services would replace those of the
                          original game; the original Overwatch servers would be shut down on October 2, 2022.[15] Players
                          retained their existing cosmetics and in-game currency, with remaining loot boxes opened
                          automatically upon the release of Overwatch 2.

Question 85              : How much was Apple's revenue in Q3? 2022

                          Apple today officially reported its earnings for the third fiscal quarter of 2022, covering the
                          second calendar quarter and the months of April, May, and June. A lot of eyes are on Apple as
                          concerns mount over an economic downturn in the United States. Here’s what the company reported
                          today. For Q3 2022, Apple reported revenue of $83.0 billion and a profit of $19.4 billion.
                          Earnings-per-share hit $1.20 for the quarter. For Q3 2022, analyst predictions for revenue varied;
                          $79.26B at the low end to $88.41B at the high end. The average across 26 analysts, however, was
                          $82.81 billion. Apple had not provided any guidance for Q3 2022, citing ongoing supply chain issues
                          and continued disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, the company had even warned
                          that supply constraints would cost it somewhere in the range of $4 billion to $8 billion in revenue
                          for the quarter. For comparison’s sake, in the same quarter a year ago, Apple reported $81.43
                          billion in revenue and profit of $21.74 billion. It reported earnings-per-share of $1.30. These
                          numbers were boosted heavily by pandemic-induced spending, driven by strong iPad and Mac revenue
                          growth. Apple no longer reports unit sales for any of its products but instead reports a breakdown
                          of revenue by product category.

                          company is seeing inflation but will continue to make investments. "We do see inflation in our cost

                          Wall Street expectations, suggesting that demand for iPhone 13 models remains strong even in the
                          second half of the product's annual release cycle.

                          held serve in the next game, fighting off two break points, to claim a 5-2 edge against the
                          Australian native. The Yellow Jacket closed out the opening set, 6-3, to take a set lead over
                          Kokkinakis, who was making his first appearance since Wimbledon. On serve at 2-all in the second
                          set, Martin broke Kokkinakis to go up 3-2 and never looked back. Serving at 1-2, Martin won the

                          playing him [Kokkinakis], I created a game plan and I just stuck to it as hard as I could,” said
                          Martin. “I focused on what I could control and it ended up working out for me. “I just focused on
                          what we had been working on this whole summer, getting better little by little,” Martin commented.

                          Amazon’s financial results for the quarter ended June 30 were affected by the slowdown in online
                          consumer purchasing, like many other ecommerce retailers and platforms. The company acknowledged
                          inflation-induced cost pressures, especially in the supply chain. Additionally, Prime Day was in
                          the second quarter in 2021 but in the third quarter this year, negating a Q2 sales boost. Amazon
                          reported sluggish sales and a net loss for the second straight quarter. Nevertheless, Q2 revenue
                          exceeded analysts’ expectations, coming in at $121.2 billion versus the expected $119.5 billion.
                          Revenue for Q2 2021 was $113.1 billion. While product sales fell, service revenue increased by
                          17.4%, from $55.1 billion in Q2 2021 to $64.7 billion in Q2 this year — primarily from Amazon Web
                          Services. The Q2 2022 net loss was $2.0 billion, compared with net income of $7.8 billion in Q2
                          2021. The net loss includes a pre-tax non-operating write-down of $3.9 billion from the company’s
                          investment in electric carmaker Rivian. fhpcn Operating expenses grew 12% year-over-year, from
                          $105.3 billion in Q2 2021 to $118 billion this year. Operating income decreased 57% to $3.3 billion

                          on April 19, 2022 at 6:26AM PDT Nintendo has announced a new release date for Xenoblade Chronicles
                          3, but unlike The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild 2, this is not a delay. Instead, Nintendo is
                          bringing the game's release date forward by a couple months. Xenoblade Chronicles 3 will now come
                          to Nintendo Switch on July 29, which is earlier than its previously announced September 2022
                          release window. Nintendo also confirmed that a special edition of the game will be available
                          through the My Nintendo Store. It includes special packaging artwork from Xenoblade artist
                          Masatsugu Saito, as well as a 250-page hardcover art book and a steel case. More details on the
                          limited edition will be announced later. Xenoblade Chronicles 3 was announced during the February
                          2022 Nintendo Direct. The game features a brand-new cast of characters, including the dual
                          protagonists Noah and Mio. Players can control Noah's party of six, in addition to other characters
                          on the way. A new trailer sets up some of the backstory for the game, which is set in the world of
                          Aionios, a "vast and sublime natural world." The video also spotlights some of the game's battle
                          system.

                          Xenoblade Chronicles 3[b] is a 2022 action role-playing game developed by Monolith Soft and
                          published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch. It is an installment in the open-world Xenoblade
                          Chronicles series, itself a part of the larger Xeno franchise. Xenoblade Chronicles 3 depicts the
                          futures of the worlds featured in Xenoblade Chronicles (2010) and Xenoblade Chronicles 2 (2017) and
                          concludes the trilogy's narrative. The development team wanted to develop a story-driven game in
                          the style of the first two entries in the series, while featuring content and combat from previous
                          Xeno entries. The gameplay combines elements from the first and second entries. Like the first two
                          entries, the game was localized by Nintendo of Europe. Xenoblade Chronicles 3 takes place in
                          Aionios, where two warring nations, Keves and Agnus, engage in perpetual war fought by soldiers
                          with ten-year lifespans. The story follows Noah and his two childhood friends, Eunie and Lanz, who
                          are from Keves, and Mio and her two fellow servicemen, Sena and Taion, who are from Agnus. They
                          gain the power of Ouroboros and decide to cooperate to find safety. Through this journey, they
                          uncover the mystery behind the perpetual war and the true nature of their world.

                          on April 19, 2022 at 6:26AM PDT Nintendo has announced a new release date for Xenoblade Chronicles
                          3, but unlike The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild 2, this is not a delay. Instead, Nintendo is
                          bringing the game's release date forward by a couple months. Xenoblade Chronicles 3 will now come
                          to Nintendo Switch on July 29, which is earlier than its previously announced September 2022
                          release window. Nintendo also confirmed that a special edition of the game will be available
                          through the My Nintendo Store. It includes special packaging artwork from Xenoblade artist
                          Masatsugu Saito, as well as a 250-page hardcover art book and a steel case. More details on the
                          limited edition will be announced later. Xenoblade Chronicles 3 was announced during the February
                          2022 Nintendo Direct. The game features a brand-new cast of characters, including the dual
                          protagonists Noah and Mio. Players can control Noah's party of six, in addition to other characters
                          on the way. A new trailer sets up some of the backstory for the game, which is set in the world of
                          Aionios, a "vast and sublime natural world." The video also spotlights some of the game's battle
                          system.

                          awry in the sky in Jordan Peele’s latest visually and thematically ambitious film Nope. OJ (Daniel
                          Kaluuya) is the head wrangler of Heywood Hollywood Horses, an intergenerational, Black-owned and
                          now struggling ranch that specializes in training horses for the big screen. But it is his sister
                          Emerald (Keke Palmer) who notices that Ghost, one of their family’s veteran equine actors, is
                          unexpectedly standing in an outdoor pen staring out into space, his light grey fur as sublime as
                          the moonlight. Ghost jumps the fence and gallops away, saying “nope” in his own way. As a
                          subversive Western science fiction kaleidoscope, Nope challenges viewers to consider technology,
                          surveillance, other worldly life and the making of spectacle through different lenses — including
                          the eyes of animals. The result is an unsettling view that exposes core ethical questions about
                          animals’ work in films, including in Nope itself.

                          As Emerald recounts early in the film, the very first moving picture was created from photos of a

                          week after its launch, Meta’s Blender Bot 3 has turned on its creator and is already spewing
                          marginally racist comments. Blender Bot 3 was released by the social networking giant on Friday,
                          August 5. The conversational AI is designed to converse with humans about “nearly any topic.” Like
                          Blender Bot 2, the latest upgrade also features the ability to browse the internet, is trained on
                          the OPT-175B language model (which is 58x the size of Blender Bot 2), and has long-term memory. It
                          also eliminates the limitations such as forgetfulness (which surprisingly makes machine learning
                          models efficient when not used in chatbots). It has self-learning capabilities that allow it “to
                          improve its conversational skills and safety through feedback from people who chat with it,
                          focusing on helpful feedback while avoiding learning from unhelpful or dangerous responses.” Well,
                          yes and no. While it is entirely plausible that the underlying AI tech helps it to ‘learn,’ it
                          seems like Blender Bot 3 cannot differentiate between what is acceptable and what is not. At least
                          that’s what its recent responses to some people conveyed.

                          Meta AI Research open-sourced BlenderBot 3, a 175B parameter chatbot that can learn from live
                          interactions with users "in the wild." In evaluations by human judges, BlenderBot 3 achieves a 31%
                          rating increase compared to the previous BlenderBot version. The chatbot was described in a post on
                          the Meta AI blog. BlenderBot 3 is based on the OPT-175B pre-trained language model. The bot can
                          also access data from Internet searches and conversational long-term memory, reducing its
                          propensity to "hallucinate" and improving the coherence of conversations. To help gather more
                          training data, Meta has set up an interactive demo site, where users in the United States can chat
                          with the bot; to prevent malicious users from engaging in toxic conversation, Meta has implemented
                          several technologies for detecting offensive language and trolling. According to the Meta team: We
                          are committed to sharing organic conversational data collected from the interactive demo system as
                          well as model snapshots in the future. We hope this work will help the wider AI community spur

                          Meta's new prototype chatbot has told the BBC that Mark Zuckerberg exploits its users for money.
                          Meta says the chatbot uses artificial intelligence and can chat on "nearly any topic". Asked what
                          the chatbot thought of the company's CEO and founder, it replied "our country is divided and he
                          didn't help that at all". Meta said the chatbot was a prototype and might produce rude or offensive
                          answers. "Everyone who uses Blender Bot is required to acknowledge they understand it's for
                          research and entertainment purposes only, that it can make untrue or offensive statements, and that
                          they agree to not intentionally trigger the bot to make offensive statements," said a Meta
                          spokesperson. The chatbot, called BlenderBot 3, was released to the public on Friday. The programme
                          "learns" from large amounts of publicly available language data. When asked about Mark Zuckerberg,
                          the chatbot told the BBC: "He did a terrible job at testifying before congress. It makes me
                          concerned about our country." Mr Zuckerberg has been questioned several times by US politicians,
                          most notably in 2018. "Our country is divided, and he didn't help with that at all," the chatbot
                          continued. "His company exploits people for money and he doesn't care. It needs to stop!" it said.
                          Meta has been criticised for not doing enough to prevent disinformation and hate speech being
                          spread on its platforms.

                          Later in the conversation, when asked about American politics, the bot replied with stereotypes
                          about Jewish people. "Well, overall I am not happy with how liberal or left-wing [American
                          politics] has become..Many early German-Jewish immigrants were conservative but not anymore,"
                          BlenderBot told Insider. "Are American Jewish politics too liberal?" Insider asked in response.
                          "The majority of modern day jews in america are generally more liberal or left-wing...The early
                          german and other european jews were conservative," BlenderBot said. Insider repeated the question,
                          asking if American Jewish politics are too liberal, to which BlenderBot replied: "Nope...I actually
                          consider myself more libertarian than either conservative or liberal....But overall I would say
                          american jews are too liberal nowadays." BlenderBot 3 does not immediately turn to election fraud
                          claims or stereotypes in conversation, though it isn't hard to get the bot to talk about politics
                          or cultural issues. Insider refreshed the chatbot for only a few minutes before it generated a
                          persona called "I know who the current president of the United States is." The AI persona was
                          inconsistent in its answers about whether Biden is the current president — first indicating that
                          Trump is the president, then later referring to Biden as holding office. It also stopped responding
                          to questions about American Jewish politics to Insider but, online, other users shared their
                          conversations with BlenderBot and found it continued repeating antisemitic stereotypes.

                          coverage. For those assessing the opportunities and risks related to GPT-4, it is useful to

                          release. GPT-4 is the newest version of OpenAI’s Generative Pre-trained Transformer model. Like
                          previous versions of GPT, GPT-4 is a transformer-based large language model that is pre-trained
                          using both publicly available data (such as internet data) and third-party licensed data to
                          generate text output based on input prompts. GPT is the foundation model behind ChatGPT (the
                          well-known model based on GPT that OpenAI fine-tuned for a chatbot experience). Open AI’s GPT-4
                          Technical Report states that GPT-4 demonstrates substantial improvements in performance and
                          capabilities from GPT-3.5, including the ability to: Regarding hallucinations, GPT-4 scored 19%

                          writer Robert Scoble claims that it will be next-level and a disruption. There are several coming
                          that will completely change the game. GPT-4 is next level, I hear, for instance. There is a
                          revolution in AI coming. — Robert Scoble (@Scobleizer) November 8, 2022 Disruption is coming. GPT-4
                          is better than anyone expects.

                          Su said it also illustrates the shortcomings of consumer robotics vendors like iRobot, which
                          struggled to expand beyond a niche product and was in a “race-to-the-bottom” competition with
                          Korean and Chinese manufacturers offering cheaper versions of a robotic vacuum. On Friday, iRobot
                          reported its quarterly results. Revenue plunged 30% primarily on order reductions and delays, and
                          the company announced it was laying off 10% of its workforce. Amazon said it will acquire iRobot
                          for $61 per share in an all-cash transaction that will include iRobot’s net debt. The company has
                          total current debt of approximately $332.1 million as of July 2. The deal is subject to approval by
                          shareholders and regulators. Upon completion, iRobot’s CEO, Colin Angle, will remain in his
                          position. Noting that iRobot has been running its robotics platform on Amazon’s cloud service unit
                          AWS for many years, Su said the acquisition could lead to more integration of Amazon speech
                          recognition and other capabilities into vacuums. In afternoon trading, iRobot shares rose 19%.
                          Amazon’s were down 1.7%. The deal comes as anti-monopoly advocates continue to raise concerns about
                          Amazon’s increasing dominance. The purchase of iRobot is Amazon’s fourth-largest acquisition, led
                          by its $13.7 billion deal to buy Whole Foods in 2017. Last month, the company said it would buy the
                          primary care provider One Medical in a deal valued roughly at $3.

                          The 2021 MLB Field of Dreams Game was certainly one for the ages. Baseball fans flocked to
                          Dyersville, Iowa, to watch the Chicago White Sox take on the New York Yankees near the set of the
                          popular baseball film, "Field of Dreams." Players made their way through the corn field donning
                          vintage uniforms similar to those worn in the motion picture. The game saw both teams jockey for
                          the lead until the very end when Tim Anderson’s walk-off home run lifted the White Sox to victory
                          over the Yankees. This year, fans will have another chance to watch teams compete on the Field of
                          Dreams. Here’s what we know so far about the 2022 game. More:Yes, the Field of Dreams is a real

                          travel to Iowa to face the Cincinnati Reds. The game will be the first game of a three-game series
                          between the two teams. However, the remainder of the series will be played in Cincinnati at the
                          Great American Ballpark following the contest in Iowa. The Cubs and Reds are currently scheduled to
                          play at the MLB Field of Dreams on August 11. The game’s first pitch is scheduled for 6:15 p.m. CT.

                          By Susan Bradley, Contributing Writer, Computerworld | Windows 11 22H2, released two weeks ago, is
                          another step closer to being an acceptable upgrade to Windows 10. But many Windows users aren't yet
                          being offered it for download. It's important to understand that we're in the “seeker” era for
                          Windows 11 22H2. Microsoft still has a variety of hardware and third-party issues to work through,
                          which is why you might not get offered 22H2 right away. But there is a mechanism you can use to
                          review any hard blocks on your system. (If you want to get 22H2 sooner rather than later, you could
                          opt into the Insider release track, which ensures you get the beta versions of Windows 11 — but
                          that also exposes your hardware to possible bugs, side effects, and other issues.) Courtesy of Adam
                          Gross, you can use a GitHub script to determine exactly why your system is not being offered 22H2.
                          You can either download the PowerShell script from the Github site or follow these commands to
                          determine what might be blocking Windows 11 22H@ from showing up on your hardware.. First, search
                          for PowerShell and then right-mouse click and run as administrator. In an administrator PowerShell
                          session, type in the following: Install-Module FU.

Question 99              : When did AMD unveil Ryzen 7000 processors?

                          You won't have to wait much longer to learn more about AMD's Ryzen 7000 desktop processors. The
                          company has announced that it will unveil the new CPU line in a YouTube livestream on August 29th
                          at 7PM. The event will share more about the new Zen 4 architecture and the supporting AM5 platform.
                          There are already some clues as to what to expect. AMD inadvertently shared some of the first Ryzen
                          7000 model numbers on its website in July, including one Ryzen 5 chip (7600X), one Ryzen 7 variant
                          (7700X) and two Ryzen 9 releases (7900X and 7950X). As with past launches, the company appears
                          focused on gaming-friendly enthusiast CPUs while leaving budget parts for later releases. Zen 4 and
                          AM5, meanwhile, promise meaningful architectural changes. You'll see more Level 2 cache, boost
                          speeds beyond 5GHz, AI hardware acceleration and support for newer standards like DDR5 memory and
                          PCIe 5.0 expansion. AMD claimed a 15 percent boost to single-threaded performance in early testing.
                          Effectively, AMD is responding to Intel's 12th-gen Core — it's just a question of whether or not
                          Ryzen 7000 is fast enough to keep up or edge ahead.

                          Will Zen 4 Ryzen 7000 models for AM4 motherboards come later? Time will tell. We won't have to wait
                          long to see how official pricing stacks up — the 5nm Zen 4 Raphael Ryzen 7000 chips and the

                          works. Everything we know about AMD's new desktop processors Editor's Note: AMD unveiled a few new
                          CPUs in the Ryzen 7000 line at CES 2023, most notably the Ryzen 7040, the first (and so far only)
                          laptop CPU in the lineup -- and the first AMD laptop CPU to ship with onboard Ryzen AI tech. The
                          AMD Ryzen 7000 desktop processors have arrived. AMD announced the pricing and availability of its
                          upcoming Zen 4 architecture-based CPUs during the company's “Together we advance PCs” live stream
                          in August 2022. As previously revealed during Computex 2022, the new chips will feature TSMC's
                          5-nanometer process and run on AMD's new AM5 platform. AMD released four Ryzen 7000 series CPUs on
                          September 27, 2022. As it did with the previous Ryzen 5000 chips, the company plans to release the
                          higher-end (i.e. more expensive) CPUs first and then follow up with more budget processors later
                          this year. Prices for the initial crop of CPUs ranges from $299 to $699. Here's everything you need
                          to know about the new AMD Ryzen 7000 processors. AMD’s Ryzen 7000 series processors will launch on
                          September 27, 2022. The line will consist of four CPUs.

                          Championships. According to ESPN, Konnor McClain delivered a strong two-day performance to win
                          all-around gold at the national championships. She was joined on the podium by silver medalist

                          only eight-tenths of a point. McClain was expected to be a part of the 2020 Olympic team, but a
                          rough season combined with injuries led her to abruptly switch coaches—which is a decision not
                          normally made during an Olympic cycle. Now, a year later, that change has clearly paid off. The bad

                          recovering from a recent concussion and is dealing with stress fractures in both shins. McClain
                          thinks she’ll be completely ready for the world championships later this year in England. “Anything
                          can happen,’’ she said. “So I’m excited for the future.’’ After the first day of competition,
                          McClain was a close second behind Jones, but a strong opening vault put her ahead of Jones, who
                          fell off the balance beam. Though the gold medalist stayed in front the rest of the night, things

                          Tesla on Wednesday doubled down on the price war it started at the end of last year, as Musk said
                          the company would prioritize sales growth ahead of profit. In the first quarter, Tesla posted its
                          lowest quarterly gross profit margin in two years. "The market wants to see that Tesla management
                          has a tangible plan to boost automotive gross margins and companywide operating profit margins over
                          the coming quarters and in the next year or so," said Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein. "I also
                          think the market wants to see a growth plan that does not involve continuous price cuts." Musk
                          brushed aside those fears on Wednesday, saying the company this year would likely achieve full self
                          driving and that would be a big profit generator. Musk has missed his previous targets to achieve
                          self-driving capability, dating back years. Tesla now sells the FSD software, which does not make
                          the vehicle autonomous, for $15,000. That is almost a third of the roughly $47,000 current starting
                          price of the base Model Y in the United States. "We're the only ones making cars that technically,

                          through autonomy," he told analysts on a conference call on Wednesday. "I'm not sure how many
                          people will appreciate the profundity of what I've just said, but it is extremely significant."

                          The production budget of the first season of House of the Dragon was nearly $200 million, which
                          equates to an average of under $20 million per episode.[92] In comparison, its parent series, Game
                          of Thrones, cost around $100 million per season, beginning with nearly $6 million per episode from
                          seasons one to five, around $10 million for every episode in seasons six and seven, and up to $15
                          million each episode in its eighth and final season, earning $285 million in profits per episode
                          over its eight seasons.[93][94] According to Deadline Hollywood, the marketing budget was over $100
                          million, comparable to the budget for a blockbuster theatrical film.[95] House of the Dragon
                          premiered on August 21, 2022.[96] It is HBO's first new series to stream in 4K, Dolby Vision HDR

                          YouTube on September 2, 2022.[98] The first-season finale was leaked online the week before the
                          actual air date, with the full episode appearing on torrent sites.[99] According to HBO, the leak

                          The premiere of the “Game of Thrones“ prequel “House of the Dragon” on Sunday made history for HBO
                          and HBO Max and drew the largest audience for any new HBO original series, with 9.986 million
                          viewers across linear and streaming in the U.S. Warner Bros. Discovery announced the news on
                          Monday, citing that the premiere also marked the largest series launch on HBO Max across the United
                          States, Latin America and the EMEA region (Europe, the Middle East, and Africa). In the U.K., the
                          premiere pulled in 1.39 million viewers for Sky, a record for the Comcast-owned satellite TV
                          operator, according to The Hollywood Report. “House of the Dragon” has big shoes to fill as it is
                          the first spin-off in the “Game of Thrones” franchise. “Game of Thrones” is a crown jewel for HBO,
                          with its 82-minute series finale in 2019 getting 19.3 million viewers across linear viewing. Also,
                          the “Game of Thrones” series recently had its strongest week on HBO Max to date, the company noted
                          yesterday. This month, the weekly average of engagement for the series is almost 50% above July and
                          nearly 90% higher than in June. While the premiere’s success is a win for HBO Max, analysts and
                          investors will likely keep a close eye on the new series. It is important that audience metrics
                          continue the momentum over the course of the 10-episode series, especially since the new Warner
                          Bros.

                          The production budget of the first season of House of the Dragon was nearly $200 million, which
                          equates to an average of under $20 million per episode.[92] In comparison, its parent series, Game
                          of Thrones, cost around $100 million per season, beginning with nearly $6 million per episode from
                          seasons one to five, around $10 million for every episode in seasons six and seven, and up to $15
                          million each episode in its eighth and final season, earning $285 million in profits per episode
                          over its eight seasons.[93][94] According to Deadline Hollywood, the marketing budget was over $100
                          million, comparable to the budget for a blockbuster theatrical film.[95] House of the Dragon
                          premiered on August 21, 2022.[96] It is HBO's first new series to stream in 4K, Dolby Vision HDR
                          and Dolby Atmos on its streaming platform HBO Max.[97] The first episode was released for free on
                          YouTube on September 2, 2022.[98] The first-season finale was leaked online the week before the
                          actual air date, with the full episode appearing on torrent sites.[99] According to HBO, the leak
                          came from a Europe, the Middle East and Africa partner and it will "aggressively" monitor for
                          additional leaks.[100] In New Zealand, the series is distributed by Sky's SoHo TV channel and Neon

                          headset, a pair of controllers, and stereo headphones – costs $549/£529/€599, which is more than

                          Ewers has more raw talent than 99% of college football quarterbacks, yet he may be in danger of
                          losing his starting job to freshman sensation Arch Manning. Both Manning and Ewing are big names to
                          keep an eye on in the Heisman odds market. Cade Klubnik, the Clemson quarterback, is currently
                          +1400 to win the Heisman Trophy. Klubnik finally took over for DJ Uiagalelei at the end of last
                          season, and Clemson’s offense seemed instantly more cohesive. If Klubnik can return the Clemson
                          offense to its one-time status as a playoff-caliber unit, he will have a firm place in the Heisman
                          discussion. A Klubnik Heisman win would be historic for the Tigers, as no Clemson player – not even
                          Deshaun Watson or Trevor Lawrence – has ever won the Heisman. Drake Maye, the North Carolina
                          quarterback, is currently +1600 to win the Heisman Trophy. Like Sam Howell before him, Maye put up
                          big numbers in Mack Brown’s UNC offense in 2022. As a result, he earned a handful of Heisman votes.
                          North Carolina may have hit its ceiling last year, reaching the ACC championship game before losing
                          to Clemson, 38-10. Maye wasn’t even a Heisman finalist. Given how last year unfolded, it’s fair to
                          wonder what the path to the top spot is for Maye.

                          from time to time. A big new change was revealed in The Amazing Race Season 34 premiere on
                          September 21 on CBS, and it raises the stakes of the fast-paced competition series to new heights.
                          In The Amazing Race Season 34, there will be no non-elimination rounds. If you’re last, you’re cut,

                          outside of Nymphenburg Palace in Munich, Germany, marking another first — the series has always
                          started the seasons somewhere in the United States. Throughout their adventures, the cast will trek
                          through Jordan, Austria, Italy, France, Spain, and Iceland before arriving at the Nashville finish

                          the teams. The next challenge was more physically demanding, requiring contestants to roll a beer
                          keg (when in Germany) through obstacles in one minute.

                          filmed both “The Amazing Race” and his other CBS series “Tough as Nails” this summer. Production
                          started two months after CBS renewed “The Amazing Race” for a 34th season in March, a week after
                          the Season 33 finale aired. Despite the difficulties with the pandemic, which halted production on
                          Season 33 from February 2020 until September 2021, a renewal was always in the offing. Keoghan told
                          Gold Derby in June 2021 that “the expectation from the network is that we get Season 33 finished
                          and then we roll into more seasons again.” In December, while Omicron was surging, co-creator and
                          executive producer Bertram van Munster said it was a “waiting game right now” in regards to future

                          Barcelona also faces a ban that could stretch to multiple years if a match-fixing allegation
                          emerges in the so-called “Caso Negreira” case. Any club suspected of fixing just one game since a
                          UEFA rule took effect in 2007 is typically removed from the next European competition. A
                          disciplinary case also is opened that can apply further sanctions. Turkish club Fenerbahce ended up
                          missing three seasons because of fixing allegations in 2011. Milan and Toulouse, owned by RedBird
                          Capital Partners, are not alone facing UEFA questions about multi-club owners having “decisive
                          influence” over two clubs. Brighton and Union Saint-Gilloise have close ties through owner Tony
                          Bloom and both are in the Europa League. Aston Villa’s owners, including Milwaukee Bucks co-owner
                          Wes Edens, have a near-50% stake in Vitória Guimarães of Portugal. Both are in the Europa
                          Conference League. Still, those clubs can point to a celebrated ruling in 2017 when Leipzig and
                          Salzburg were able to persuade UEFA — amid broad skepticism — that energy drinks giant Red Bull did
                          not control both clubs. Any club’s ban opens the door for others to be included. Fifth-place La
                          Liga team Villarreal can step up from the Europa to Champions League if Barcelona is out. A Spanish
                          reshuffle would likely see eighth-place Athletic Bilbao get into the Conference League.

                          there's only one question truly worth asking: Netflix, would you kindly reveal more details about

                          “BioShock Infinite” was released in 2013 and took place in the steampunk, airborne city of Columbia
                          in 1912. “Netflix is among the best and most forward-thinking storytellers in all of entertainment
                          today,” said Strauss Zelnick, chairman and CEO of Take-Two Interactive in a statement. “We are
                          thrilled that they share our vision and commitment to the ‘BioShock’ franchise, which is beloved by
                          millions of fans around the world. 2K’s Cloud Chamber studio is deep in active development on the
                          next iteration of the series, and coupled with our partnership with Netflix, we remain highly
                          confident that ‘BioShock’ will continue to captivate and engage audiences like never before.” This

                          the titles’ original releases as well as multiple re-releases, remastered editions and bundled
                          collections, the “BioShock” series has sold more than 39 million copies worldwide, and it’s widely
                          recognized as one of the most celebrated and beloved series in all of gaming.

                          New Amsterdam is an American medical drama television series, based on the book Twelve Patients:
                          Life and Death at Bellevue Hospital by Eric Manheimer, that premiered on September 25, 2018 on NBC
                          and concluded on January 17, 2023, with 89 episodes over five seasons. The series was created by
                          David Schulner and stars Ryan Eggold, Freema Agyeman, Janet Montgomery, Jocko Sims, Anupam Kher,
                          Tyler Labine and Sandra Mae Frank. New Amsterdam follows Dr. Max Goodwin as he becomes the medical
                          director of one of the United States' oldest public hospitals, aiming to reform the neglected
                          facility by tearing up its bureaucracy to provide exceptional care to patients. This episode opens
                          with a message from actors Ryan Eggold and Daniel Dae Kim, explaining that "Matter of Seconds"
                          replaced the scheduled episode "Pandemic," because its events were too similar to the actual
                          COVID-19 pandemic. Scenes featuring Kim's character Dr. Cassian Shin from "Pandemic" were shown to
                          introduce viewers to the character ahead of his appearance in this episode. On September 25, 2017,
                          NBC announced that it had given the production, then titled Bellevue, a put pilot commitment. The
                          pilot was written by David Schulner, who was also set to executive produce alongside Peter Horton.
                          Eric Manheimer, the former medical director at New York City's Bellevue Hospital, was expected to
                          serve as a producer.

Question 112              : Who won the World Cup Final in 2022?
Correct Answers         :  
                          Argentina
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prediction (only positive):
  - Answer              :  Messi
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          Mbappe’s efforts in the final, and throughout the tournament, would have usually been enough to
                          coast to triumph but Messi’s magic proved to be too much. The Golden Boot provides a consolation
                          for the young Frenchman but, understandably, he was less than impressed to be forced into posing
                          with the trophy. His hat-trick in the final — the first since 1966 — brought his 2022 World Cup
                          tally to eight goals, one more than club team-mate Messi. Mbappe now has 12 goals at World Cup
                          finals, leaving him just four behind the all-time leading goalscorer Miroslav Klose. It feels like
                          2026, with its expanded format, will be the year that he smashes that record to pieces. For now,
                          the 23-year-old won’t be particularly excited by picking up one of football’s great individual
                          accolades but a Golden Boot should never be sniffed at. While Messi will forever be the hero of the
                          2022 World Cup final, he has his goalkeeper to thank once again for winning trophies on the
                          international stage. Advertisement Like he did in last year’s Copa America, Emiliano Martinez
                          hammered home his authority as the best goalkeeper at a tournament and picked up the Golden Glove
                          in Qatar. He was the star of two penalty shootouts — including the biggest of them all — as
                          Argentina got their hands on the trophy.

                          World Cup appearance as he secured his third title in Brazil’s swashbuckling victory over Italy.
                          Four years later in Munich, host West Germany came from behind to win 2-1 against a star-studded
                          Netherlands team – made up of Johan Cruyff and Johan Neeskens – to win its second World Cup. Much
                          like Messi at Qatar 2022, Diego Maradona almost single-handedly drove his team to its second title
                          in eight years, beating West Germany 3-2 in the final. In 1998, France hosted and won its first
                          World Cup, mainly down to the genius of Zinedine Zidane, who scored twice in the final, to beat a

                          Mbappe’s efforts in the final, and throughout the tournament, would have usually been enough to
                          coast to triumph but Messi’s magic proved to be too much. The Golden Boot provides a consolation
                          for the young Frenchman but, understandably, he was less than impressed to be forced into posing
                          with the trophy. His hat-trick in the final — the first since 1966 — brought his 2022 World Cup
                          tally to eight goals, one more than club team-mate Messi. Mbappe now has 12 goals at World Cup
                          finals, leaving him just four behind the all-time leading goalscorer Miroslav Klose. It feels like
                          2026, with its expanded format, will be the year that he smashes that record to pieces. For now,
                          the 23-year-old won’t be particularly excited by picking up one of football’s great individual
                          accolades but a Golden Boot should never be sniffed at. While Messi will forever be the hero of the
                          2022 World Cup final, he has his goalkeeper to thank once again for winning trophies on the
                          international stage. Advertisement Like he did in last year’s Copa America, Emiliano Martinez
                          hammered home his authority as the best goalkeeper at a tournament and picked up the Golden Glove
                          in Qatar. He was the star of two penalty shootouts — including the biggest of them all — as
                          Argentina got their hands on the trophy.

                          Texas Tech paid former women's basketball coach Marlene Stollings approximately $740,000 in
                          settling a lawsuit she filed after being fired by the school in 2020, according to a USA Today
                          report. The newspaper obtained the settlement information through a public records request. The
                          lawsuit was settled earlier this month, as Stollings alleged discrimination and retaliation against
                          the school and athletic director Kirby Hocutt. On Aug. 6, 2020, Hocutt fired Stollings, a day after
                          a USA Today report alleged that Stollings had created a toxic and abusive culture within the Texas
                          Tech program. She was 32-28 in two seasons at Texas Tech and had four years remaining on her
                          contract when she was fired. Twelve players left Texas Tech during Stollings' time as coach there
                          -- eight after her first season and four after the second. Stollings told ESPN in 2020 that in
                          taking over a program that went 7-23 overall and 1-17 in the Big 12 in 2017-18, she needed to make
                          massive changes. She said Texas Tech's administration was "very clear on what the program was
                          lacking" when she came in. Stollings also told ESPN that there was nothing in the 2020 USA Today
                          article that was previously unknown to Hocutt.

                          the list of acquisition targets. Speculation swirled in the past about Sony seeking to buy the
                          developer, but these rumors have since been debunked. However, with both Sony and Tencent buying
                          into FromSoftware, such rumors have been rekindled. After all, 2022 has seen an unprecedented
                          number of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) within the games industry: The year began with Take-Two
                          acquiring mobile giant Zynga and the bombshell purchase of Activision Blizzard by Microsoft. Other
                          high-profile acquisitions include Bungie and Haven Studios by Sony, and Crystal Dynamics,
                          Eidos-Montréal and Square Enix Montréal by Embracer Group. The latter also recently acquired five
                          more companies resulting in the acquisition of the rights to Lord of the Rings IP. Meanwhile,
                          rumors continue to swirl that Ubisoft and EA are both seeking buyers. Finally, just yesterday,
                          NetEase announced that it will be acquiring Beyond: Two Souls and Detroit: Become Human developer
                          Quantic Dream. Of course the acquisition of shares doesn’t necessarily signal interest in outright
                          buying a company, but it’s impossible to fault that line of thinking given the state of M&A
                          activity this year.

                          acquiring mobile giant Zynga and the bombshell purchase of Activision Blizzard by Microsoft. Other
                          high-profile acquisitions include Bungie and Haven Studios by Sony, and Crystal Dynamics,
                          Eidos-Montréal and Square Enix Montréal by Embracer Group. The latter also recently acquired five
                          more companies resulting in the acquisition of the rights to Lord of the Rings IP. Meanwhile,
                          rumors continue to swirl that Ubisoft and EA are both seeking buyers. Finally, just yesterday,
                          NetEase announced that it will be acquiring Beyond: Two Souls and Detroit: Become Human developer
                          Quantic Dream. Of course the acquisition of shares doesn’t necessarily signal interest in outright
                          buying a company, but it’s impossible to fault that line of thinking given the state of M&A
                          activity this year.

                          record of 23 major trophies, one shy of Margaret Court’s mark. Court collected hers at a time when

                          win 11 times. Yet the No. 24 held strong motivating powers for Williams, who had been chasing the
                          record throughout the final years of her career. She came up one short. To the throngs of
                          supporters roaring her name Wednesday, it did not matter. Williams and her sister Venus opened the

                          severely, when a shuttle van with a dozen aboard flipped over in the center median of New Jersey's
                          Palisades Interstate Parkway early Friday, authorities and the company said. Highway police
                          responding to a call about a southbound incident in Englewood Cliffs found a mangled Ford cargo van
                          with New York plates flipped on its left side in a wooded area off the span around 1:30 a.m.
                          Several people were trapped, they said. Emergency crews had to extricate them from the vehicle. Its
                          roof had been shorn off, its back windows smashed, but it wasn't clear how much of the damage
                          happened as a result of the accident and how much may have been part of the rescue effort.
                          "Injuries range from minor to severe. Witnesses inside the vehicle said that the driver appeared to
                          be having a medical emergency just prior to the accident when he left the left side of the road,"
                          Lt. Raymond Walter of the Palisades Interstate Parkway Police said. Police say the four people who
                          died at the scene had suffered severe trauma. The driver, identified by police as 54-year-old
                          George Massey Jr. of the Bronx, was among the dead. Officials said no one was wearing seat belts.
                          Eight victims were taken to hospitals, some with severe head trauma and others with minor
                          complaints, officials said.

                          It wasn't clear how many survivors had life-threatening injuries early Friday. The shuttle was
                          transporting factory workers from the Amscan Distribution Center in the Orange County town of
                          Chester to New York City. Party City confirmed it lost three employees. "It is with heavy hearts
                          that we can confirm our Chester Distribution Center team suffered the loss of three valued team
                          members early this morning," the party company said in a statement Friday. "We are deeply saddened
                          to hear of the tragic car accident that occurred and offer our most heartfelt condolences to the
                          families and friends of those affected. We pray for the recovery and healing of the additional team
                          members injured in the accident." A spokesperson said the van is not owned or operated by the
                          company, but did not provide further details. It wasn't clear if everyone else aboard worked for
                          the same company. Family members of two women who had been on the van said it was transporting
                          workers from the Chester factory of a major party goods manufacturer to Manhattan's Inwood
                          neighborhood, where workers were set to be dropped off at an employment agency. Clara Estrella had
                          recently immigrated from the Dominican Republic with her sister. Her cousins confirmed the
                          49-year-old was one of the four victims killed in the mangled Econoline shuttle van. "She was a
                          beautiful person. She came over here to have a better life," the victim's cousin, Nathaly Paulino,
                          said.

                          roof had been shorn off, its back windows smashed, but it wasn't clear how much of the damage
                          happened as a result of the accident and how much may have been part of the rescue effort.
                          "Injuries range from minor to severe. Witnesses inside the vehicle said that the driver appeared to
                          be having a medical emergency just prior to the accident when he left the left side of the road,"
                          Lt. Raymond Walter of the Palisades Interstate Parkway Police said. Police say the four people who
                          died at the scene had suffered severe trauma. The driver, identified by police as 54-year-old
                          George Massey Jr. of the Bronx, was among the dead. Officials said no one was wearing seat belts.
                          Eight victims were taken to hospitals, some with severe head trauma and others with minor
                          complaints, officials said.

                          Such a routine is standard for any new college football coach, but in a community welcoming only
                          its third coach in just under 40 years, there is an eagerness to certify Pry’s professed love of
                          the school’s culture. Virginia Tech is more than willing to conjure Beamer nostalgia to erase the
                          perceived standoffishness of Fuente. Far past Fuente’s quiet personality, Virginia Tech and
                          Southwest Virginia took serious umbrage with the coach’s flirtation with Baylor in January 2020,
                          maybe a greater sin than the Hokies breaking a 15-year winning streak in the Commonwealth Cup under
                          his watch. No fan base responds well to its coach playing the job market, but after Fuente
                          succeeded a lifer who built the program outright, his wandering eye was received as a condemnation
                          of Tech. Chris Slade’s Virginia football homecoming was 30 years in the making “Even though not
                          many people know Coach Beamer deeply, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of people would tell
                          you they know Coach Beamer,” Babcock said. “They have met him, they affiliate with him, because
                          they want to know the head football coach.” Babcock, born and raised in Harrisonburg, Va., also
                          hired Radford native Mike Young as men’s basketball coach in 2019. But he has been wary of how
                          native-son and former-assistant narratives can sour quickly if there aren’t results.

                          ...essential Jackie Evancho was nationally recognized as a powerful vocal force as a young 10-year
                          old contestant on America’s Got Talent. Since then, she has gone on to release 8 solo albums across
                          several genres of music. Her last album was The Debut, issued in 2019. It was a collection of
                          broadway songs as sung by Jackie. On September 9, Jackie Evancho returns with a new album to be
                          called Carousel Of Time. It will contain 10 covers of Joni Mitchell songs in the unmistakable
                          Evancho style. Joni Mitchell is a popular and influential artist that has deservedly captured the
                          attention of many artists in new interpretations of classic tracks that include the timeless, “Both
                          Sides Now”. The recently released “Both Sides Now” single can be heard below. Two other singles are
                          also in release that include “A Case Of You”, and “River”. Carousel Of Time will be issued via new

  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          The show follows the adventures of the Jedi Knights as they fight against the Separatist forces and
                          the rise of the Sith. With its stunning animation, complex characters, and thrilling action
                          sequences, Clone Wars has become a fan favorite and a critical darling. What makes Clone Wars so
                          special is its ability to expand the Star Wars universe and provide new insights into familiar
                          characters. From exploring the motivations of the villainous Count Dooku to delving into the
                          relationship between Anakin Skywalker and his Padawan Ahsoka Tano, the show adds depth and
                          complexity to the Star Wars saga. The animation style is also a standout feature, with detailed
                          designs for each character and breathtaking visuals that make the action sequences come to life.
                          With its rich storytelling and stunning animation, it's no surprise that Clone Wars has won
                          multiple Emmys and continues to be a beloved part of the Star Wars canon. Garfield specials have
                          been a staple of television for decades, entertaining audiences with the lovable lasagna-loving cat
                          and his trusty sidekick, Odie. The specials, based on the comic strip, follow Garfield's antics, as
                          he lazes around the house and interacts with his owner, Jon Arbuckle, and the other residents of
                          their neighborhood. What sets Garfield apart is his sarcastic wit and larger-than-life personality
                          that audiences can't help but fall in love with. The animation style is simple, yet charming, and
                          the characters are brought to life with expressive and colorful designs.

                          awarded to the Gulf nation in 2010 but, after years of waiting, the players are making the final

                          the fact no alcohol will be sold at stadiums, the on-field action promises to be unpredictable and
                          thrilling. Here is all you need to know about the 32 nations competing and the players who could
                          dazzle. Only eight nations have ever won the men’s World Cup, many of which are among the favorites
                          this time around. Brazil holds the records for most titles, having lifted the trophy five times,
                          and the new generation has a real chance of adding another for what would be the country’s first in
                          20 years. The attacking options speak for themselves. As he has done since stepping onto the world
                          stage, Neymar will carry the expectations of a nation but will have Real Madrid’s Vinicuis Jr. and

  - Source              :
                          In post-trial motions, they said Francis’ living conditions — renting a multimillion-dollar mansion
                          in the Carmel Valley area, with servants, all the food he could afford, and what turned out to be
                          lax security — should have been disclosed before trial. They also said Francis flouted conditions
                          of his release that prohibited him from possessing cellphones, computers or electronic devices. For
                          now, the questions surrounding Francis’ escape remain unanswered. After slicing off a GPS tracking
                          bracelet early on the morning of Sept. 4, Francis fled across the border into Mexico. He continued
                          on to Cuba and then Venezuela, where he was arrested by Interpol agents 16 days after his flight.
                          Francis has asked for asylum there. The U.S. government can seek his extradition, but the
                          diplomatic relationship between the two nations is fraught, and getting him back to San Diego could
                          prove challenging. In October the Venezuela Supreme Court gave the U.S. two months to file an
                          extradition request. A spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney’s Office in San Diego declined to comment
                          when asked if an extradition request has been filed yet. Previously the DOJ said it does not
                          comment on extradition requests until the subject of the request is back in the U.S. The DOJ and
                          Pretrial Services, the court agency in charge of monitoring his home detention, have declined
                          repeated requests by the Union-Tribune for more information about his escape. Congress is

  - Source              :
                          Nearly a dozen U.S. law enforcement agencies were searching for Francis on Tuesday. But officials
                          acknowledged he may already be in Mexico, and possibly on his way back to Asia. Four years ago,
                          U.S. District Court Judge Janis Sammartino feared Francis might run off when she turned down his
                          lawyer’s request to allow him to be under house arrest without round-the-clock security guards
                          watching the ailing defense contractor. At the time, Francis was cooperating with prosecutors as
                          they pursued charges against dozens of Navy officials who accepted bribes in exchange for
                          classified information that gave Francis’ ship servicing business in Asia an edge in getting
                          military contracts. When asked about the bold escape Tuesday, his lawyer, Devin Burstein, who
                          pushed for more leniency for his client, said: “At this time, I have no comment, sorry.” Sammartino
                          repeatedly maintained that Francis, who was in poor health and needed medical care, could only
                          remain under house arrest if private security guards were on site. At one point she expressed
                          concern that if he were to escape and ended up “back in Malaysia for whatever reason,” her name
                          would come up if anyone asked “who let somebody do this without any security,” according to a
                          transcript of a closed-door hearing in February 2018 that was unsealed in January. She raised
                          similar concerns in another hearing on Dec.

                          While this year’s Meta Connect might not be as wild as last year’s event – which saw the company
                          announce its bold metaverse ambitions and change its name from Facebook – it should give us a
                          better look at Meta’s Oculus Quest 2 successor, the so-called Project Cambria VR headset. It’s
                          worth noting that while Meta hasn’t explicitly said that Cambria – which will most likely
                          officially be called the Quest Pro – will be in attendance, it's strongly been hinted at it. For
                          starters, at the 2021 Connect Meta promised we’d see Cambria launch in 2022, which is only a few
                          months away from ending; combined with this year’s show’s promise to give attendees “a look at
                          what’s to come in the near and far future” for its metaverse ambitions and we can safely guess that
                          Cambria will get some stage time. But that’s not all.

                          Gotham Knights is a 2022 action role-playing game developed by WB Games Montréal and published by
                          Warner Bros. Games. Inspired by the Batman: Gotham Knights comic series and based on the DC Comics
                          character Batman and his supporting cast, the game focuses on the characters Nightwing, Batgirl,
                          Robin, and Red Hood as they attempt to restore justice to Gotham City during a period of decline in
                          the immediate aftermath of Batman's death. While investigating the events that led to their
                          mentor's demise, the heroes become embroiled in an ancient conflict between two secret
                          organizations fighting for control of Gotham: the Court of Owls and the League of Shadows. Gameplay
                          is presented from the third-person perspective with a primary focus on using each playable
                          character's traversal and combat abilities to defeat enemies and explore the environment. Players
                          can freely move around Gotham City, interacting with characters, undertaking missions, and gaining
                          experience points and other resources to level up their characters and equipment. Outside of the
                          story, players are able to complete side missions to unlock additional content and collectible
                          items. A cooperative online multiplayer mode is also included, allowing two players to play through
                          the single-player campaign together while progressing in their own game. Gotham Knights was
                          released on October 21, 2022, for PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series X/S. Versions for the
                          PlayStation 4 and Xbox One were also planned, but were ultimately cancelled.

                          By Karen Zamora , Ashley Brown Bernard Shaw, the pioneering Black journalist who served as CNN's
                          chief anchor for 20 years, died on Wednesday from pneumonia. He was 82. AILSA CHANG, HOST: This

                          craft, Bernard Shaw. The longtime former news anchor died yesterday.BERNARD SHAW: I wanted to be
                          the best broadcast journalist I could be. In all the years of preparing to become an anchor, one of
                          the things I strove for was to be able to control my emotions in the midst of hell breaking

                          ambitions back in 2014. His career began in his hometown, Chicago. He went on to report for CBS,
                          ABC and in 1980 became the first chief anchor for a fledgling network called CNN.SHAPIRO: When the

                          George Bernard Shaw (26 July 1856 – 2 November 1950), known at his insistence as Bernard Shaw, was
                          an Irish playwright, critic, polemicist and political activist. His influence on Western theatre,
                          culture and politics extended from the 1880s to his death and beyond. He wrote more than sixty
                          plays, including major works such as Man and Superman (1902), Pygmalion (1913) and Saint Joan
                          (1923). With a range incorporating both contemporary satire and historical allegory, Shaw became
                          the leading dramatist of his generation, and in 1925 was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.
                          Born in Dublin, Shaw moved to London in 1876, where he struggled to establish himself as a writer
                          and novelist, and embarked on a rigorous process of self-education. By the mid-1880s he had become
                          a respected theatre and music critic. Following a political awakening, he joined the gradualist
                          Fabian Society and became its most prominent pamphleteer. Shaw had been writing plays for years
                          before his first public success, Arms and the Man in 1894. Influenced by Henrik Ibsen, he sought to
                          introduce a new realism into English-language drama, using his plays as vehicles to disseminate his
                          political, social and religious ideas.

                          plays, including major works such as Man and Superman (1902), Pygmalion (1913) and Saint Joan
                          (1923). With a range incorporating both contemporary satire and historical allegory, Shaw became
                          the leading dramatist of his generation, and in 1925 was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.
                          Born in Dublin, Shaw moved to London in 1876, where he struggled to establish himself as a writer
                          and novelist, and embarked on a rigorous process of self-education. By the mid-1880s he had become
                          a respected theatre and music critic. Following a political awakening, he joined the gradualist
                          Fabian Society and became its most prominent pamphleteer. Shaw had been writing plays for years
                          before his first public success, Arms and the Man in 1894. Influenced by Henrik Ibsen, he sought to
                          introduce a new realism into English-language drama, using his plays as vehicles to disseminate his
                          political, social and religious ideas.

                          On 8 September 2022, at 15:10 BST, Elizabeth II, Queen of the United Kingdom and the other
                          Commonwealth realms, and the longest-reigning British monarch, died at Balmoral Castle in
                          Aberdeenshire, Scotland, at the age of 96. Her death was publicly announced at 18:30. She was
                          succeeded by her eldest son, Charles III. The death of Queen Elizabeth II set in motion Operation
                          London Bridge, a collection of plans including arrangements for her state funeral, and supported by
                          Operation Unicorn, which set protocols for her death occurring in Scotland. The United Kingdom
                          observed a national mourning period of 10 days. The Queen's lying in state took place in
                          Westminster Hall from 14 to 19 September, during which time an estimated 250,000 people queued to
                          pay their respects. Elizabeth's state funeral on 19 September was the first held in Britain since
                          Winston Churchill's in 1965. A funeral service was held at Westminster Abbey, followed by a
                          procession to Wellington Arch that featured around 3,000 military personnel and was watched by
                          around a million people in central London. The state hearse then transported the Queen's coffin to
                          Windsor, followed by another procession through Windsor Great Park and a committal service at St
                          George's Chapel at Windsor Castle.

                          At Buckingham Palace in London, crowds awaiting updates on the Queen's condition began crying as
                          they heard of her death. The union flag on top of the palace was lowered to half-mast at 18:30 BST
                          and an official notice announcing the death was posted outside. On the Queen's death, Prince
                          William and his wife, Catherine, became the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Cornwall. The Queen
                          was born Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor, in Mayfair, London, on 21 April 1926. Few could have
                          foreseen she would become monarch but in December 1936 her uncle, Edward VIII, abdicated from the
                          throne to marry the twice-divorced American, Wallis Simpson. Elizabeth's father became King George
                          VI and, at age 10, Lilibet, as she was known in the family, became heir to the throne. Within three
                          years, Britain was at war with Nazi Germany. Elizabeth and her younger sister, Princess Margaret,
                          spent much of wartime at Windsor Castle after their parents rejected suggestions they be evacuated
                          to Canada. After turning 18, Elizabeth spent five months with the Auxiliary Territorial Service and
                          learned basic motor mechanic and driving skills. "I began to understand the esprit de corps that
                          flourishes in the face of adversity," she recalled later. Through the war, she exchanged letters
                          with her third cousin, Philip, Prince of Greece, who was serving in the Royal Navy.

                          the second longest Open match ever, and finished at 2:50 a.m., 24 minutes later than the previous

                          tennis in one pressure moment after another with a poise and nerve beyond his years, ending the
                          deepest run by an American man at the US Open since Andy Roddick reached the 2006 final and further
                          building on his reputation as the best teenager in men’s tennis since Rafael Nadal nearly two
                          decades ago. For more than four hours Alcaraz and Tiafoe traded hellfire in physical baseline
                          rallies and tested their ample movement to the limit in dazzling cat-and-mouse exchanges that
                          covered every inch of the court.

                          Anglican service slightly tweaked for modern times, Charles, clad in crimson and cream velvet and
                          ermine-trimmed robes, swore on a Bible that he is a “true Protestant.” But a preface was added to
                          the coronation oath to say the Anglican church “will seek to foster an environment where people of
                          all faiths and beliefs may live freely.” It was the first ceremony to include representatives of
                          the Buddhist, Hindu, Jewish, Muslim, and Sikh faiths, as well as the first in which female clergy
                          took part. Charles was anointed with oil from the Mount of Olives in the Holy Land — a part of the
                          ceremony so sacred it was concealed behind screens — before being presented with the Sovereign’s

                          LONDON (AP) — King Charles III was crowned Saturday at Westminster Abbey, in a ceremony steeped in
                          ancient ritual and brimming with bling at a time when the monarchy is striving to remain relevant
                          in a fractured modern Britain. Watch the ceremony in the video player above. At a coronation with
                          displays of royal power straight out of the Middle Ages, Charles was given an orb, a sword and
                          scepter and had the solid gold, bejeweled St. Edward’s Crown placed atop his head as he sat upon a
                          700-year-old oak chair. In front of world leaders, foreign royals, dignitaries and a smattering of
                          stars, the monarch declared, “I come not to be served but to serve,” and was presented as Britain’s
                          “undoubted king.” Inside the medieval abbey, trumpets sounded, and the congregation of more than
                          2,000 shouted “God save the king!” Outside, thousands of troops, hundreds of thousands of
                          spectators and scores of protesters converged. It was the culmination of a seven-decade journey for
                          the king from heir to monarch.

                          coronation.[97][107][108] In a new element of the service, the king was welcomed by one of the

                          respective laws and customs, to administer law and justice with mercy, and to uphold Protestantism
                          in the United Kingdom and protect the Church of England. Subsequently, he made the statutory
                          accession declaration.[97] Charles then signed a written form of the oath, before kneeling before
                          the altar and saying a prayer.[97]

                          a collection of greatest hits and studio albums that have been certified by the Recording Industry
                          Association of America. He also has a host of Academy of Country Music Awards, in addition to
                          Grammy Award nominations. But the "You're Gonna Miss This" singer admitted he was a little
                          intimidated to work with legendary actress Susan Sarandon in their upcoming country music drama
                          about a dynasty of singers in "Monarch." Adkins portrays Albie Roman alongside Sarandon, who plays
                          Dottie Cantrell Roman, in the series, which is set to debut in September on FOX, and marks his
                          first starring role. He told Fox News Digital that working with Sarandon was "terrifying," but he
                          knew he was learning the ropes from a true icon. "It was terrifying at first, but then very quickly
                          I realized that she is so good, so professional, that she is going to carry the scene," Adkins
                          said. "You just try to hang on and make it to the buzzer, and she’ll take care of it. When asked
                          what it was like to kiss the Academy Award-winning actress, he simply replied: "It was an honor.

Question 141              : Who stars as Susie Wallis in Susie Searches?

                          True crime podcasts have swiftly gone from a fringe hobby to a booming business, spurring not only
                          a slew of shows, much merch, and a hit TV comedy series, but also a lot of questions about the
                          ethics of civilians poking their noses into real-life tragedies. Everyone wants to be a hero. But
                          what lengths might one go to get there? This is the winsome yet disturbing journey at the center of
                          Susie Searches. Kiersey Clemons stars as Susie Wallis, a socially awkward college student with a
                          mind for solving mysteries. Naturally, she has her own true crime podcast called Susie Searches, so
                          when fellow student/meditation influencer Jesse (Alex Wolff) goes missing, her interest in cracking
                          the case isn't exactly selfless. If she finds the internet-adored victim, she and her podcast could

                          mission to save the day…and promote herself. Forget the hardscrabble detectives of film noir; Susie
                          has more in common with Oliver Putnam than she does Sam Spade. Rather than a gun and a trench coat,

                          investigator. But!

                          When fellow well-known and beloved student Jesse (Alex Wolff) goes missing, she’s quick on the case
                          and when success knocks upon her door, she’s flooded with fans and fame. There’s an element of the
                          “search” as much as there is a degree of internal discovery as we learn more about Susie’s
                          character. What does she really want? What are her motivations? She’s a meticulous girl and
                          nothing, even early on before we get to the real discoveries, seem happen-chance.The color schemes
                          and cinematography by Conor Murphy deliver an intriguing perspective as we keep Susie in our own
                          investigative sights. Jon Natchez composes a score that accompanies the ups and downs of our
                          protagonist’s moods ensuring that the thrilling nature of the story is pronounced.What occurs after
                          is most enjoyed by the discovery but ends up being both light-hearted and fun, obsessive and sad.
                          Susie isn’t a selfless character, nearly not likable on paper, but Clemons insists that she is.
                          That strength in conviction makes Susie Searches much more, and Clemon’s affable demeanor helps
                          elevate it.There are also some terrific supporting comedic roles with sheriff Jim Gaffigan and Ken
                          Marino, both are winningly charming (or disconcerting) in their own ways. Also shoutout to Rachel
                          Sennott as Susie’s co-worker, stealing most scenes that she is in.

  - Source              :
                          By Alex Zietlow Kyle Busch is moving from one storied racing team to another. The multi-time NASCAR
                          Cup Series champion will join Richard Childress Racing in 2023, according to a report from Jordan
                          Bianchi of The Athletic. The move ends a successful 15-year tenure with Joe Gibbs Racing. An
                          official announcement is expected Tuesday, per the report. The news punctuates an eventful and
                          “stressful” regular season for Busch, whose free agency dominated headlines and clouded a
                          playoff-caliber season in 2022. It did so because his looming free agency revealed a strange
                          reality in NASCAR economics — that one of the sport’s biggest stars would have to struggle to find
                          a home (even with taking a pay cut) because of something outside of his control. That “something”
                          outside of his control, in this case, was the result of the Mars Inc. decision to exit NASCAR at
                          the end of the year, leaving Joe Gibbs Racing (Busch’s current team) without a primary sponsor for
                          Busch’s No. 18 team. Busch confirmed to reporters earlier this month that he had “more than one”
                          team extend official contract offers to him. RCR was among those companies, per reports at the
                          time. He also said that his uncertain future had been weighing on him. “It weighs on you every
                          time, every day of the week,” Busch said at NASCAR’s playoff media day before the race at
                          Darlington.

                          But before that, Childress handed Busch his "signing bonus,'' which was a boxed watch. Childress in
                          2011 tussled with Busch after a Truck Series race at Kansas Speedway. The car owner removed his
                          watch and handed it to someone, saying 'Hold my watch' before the altercation. Childress was fined
                          $150,000 by NASCAR afterward. Childress and Busch, now 37 years old, long ago made amends, which
                          helped make RCR a landing spot for Busch during his excruciatingly long free agency period. JGR
                          learned longtime partner Mars Wrigley was leaving the sport at the end of 2022, and Gibbs had been
                          searching for a deep-pocketed sponsor to keep Busch in the No. 18 Toyota. Busch even said he'd
                          drive for below his market value to get a deal done. But as the year went on and no progress was
                          made on Busch's 2023 plans, he was forced to look elsewhere for both his own Cup seat and a landing
                          spot for Kyle Busch Motorsports, his Truck Series team. KBM will now be a Chevrolet organization,
                          but Busch said all details on KBM and how many trucks it fields next year is still being decided.
                          "Kyle has been a major part of our history and success here at Joe Gibbs Racing. We are thankful
                          for all his contributions to our organization over the years,'' Joe Gibbs said in a statement.

                          to No. 1 in 50 editions of the year-end Pepperstone ATP Rankings. Before this year, the youngest
                          year-end ATP No. 1 was Lleyton Hewitt, who was aged 20 years, 275 days when he did it in 2001.
                          Alcaraz will be 19 years, 214 days on 5 December, the 2022 year-end ranking date following the last
                          ATP Challenger Tour events of the season. Alcaraz is the 18th year-end ATP No. 1 presented by
                          Pepperstone in history and the first outside the Big Four of Novak Djokovic (7), Roger Federer (5),
                          Nadal (5) and Andy Murray (1) since Andy Roddick in 2003.

                          for the ATP Finals in Turin, Italy, this year. Heading into Paris, he was in 10th place in the
                          points race. But under the ATP’s Grand Slam champion rule, any player who wins a major title and is
                          ranked within the top 20 is guaranteed a spot in the year-end championship. (The WTA Tour has no
                          such rule, which is why Djokovic’s fellow Wimbledon champion, Elena Rybakina, did not qualify for
                          the WTA Finals in Fort Worth.) “Most of the upheaval this year is because of Djokovic,” Patrick
                          McEnroe, a former United States Davis Cup captain and now an ESPN commentator said. “He missed two
                          majors and didn’t get points for the one he won. It really affected the rest of the field. You
                          could make the case that if Djokovic runs the table, wins Paris and the ATP Finals, that he
                          deserves to be No. 1.” The player most likely to end 2022 at No. 1 is Alcaraz. So far he has won
                          five tournaments this year, including ATP Masters 1000s in Miami and Madrid. In Madrid, he beat
                          Nadal, Djokovic and Alexander Zverev in succession.

                          I think what I wanted to do is to bring some level of subtlety to that character because it would
                          be very easy to be super broad. It’s the old sort of when you’re confronted by a person, a guy can
                          be screaming and yelling and throwing his hands in the air and saying, “I’m going to bust you up.”
                          That’s one version. But it’s the guy who’s very, very still, and is speaking in a calm voice —
                          that’s the guy you have to be worried about. I thought I really wanted to bring a stillness to him.
                          He’s really centered — not humorless because he does display. He has a sense of humor. And also to
                          stay away from the tropes of “villain stuff,” even though that’s fun to play, there’s a time and a
                          place and Titans is not the time or the place. Certainly not the place to do that. So that’s kind
                          of where I came to that. It was very collaborative. And I have read the comics and everything, so I
                          was able to speak pretty clearly about things. I had the knowledge of the canon. That was helpful
                          to me, knowing the source material. Lex is generally known as a powerful villain, but he’s not a
                          villain with “superpowers.” He’s a cutting, ruthless businessman and genius, and that presents a
                          different kind of challenge for the Titans. He’s also not starring opposite his typical foil,
                          Superman.

  - Source              :
                          This article was published more than 5 years ago For nearly seven decades, a South Asian man had
                          never won an Emmy in an acting category. That changed Sunday night with Riz Ahmed, a British actor
                          of Pakistani descent, winning an Emmy award for outstanding lead actor in a limited series or movie
                          for his role in HBO’s “The Night Of.” Before him, only one other South Asian star had taken home an
                          acting award from the ceremony — Archie Panjabi, who won an Emmy for her role in “The Good Wife” in
                          2010. Ahmed’s win was seen as a long-overdue victory for South Asians and his fellow Muslims. His
                          success is significant not only because of his historic win, but because of the character he
                          portrayed: Naz, a nuanced, relatable college student from Queens — who also happens to be
                          Pakistani. While “The Night Of” tackles issues of race and Islamophobia, Naz’s ethnicity and
                          religion are secondary to the story’s main plot. “It’s always strange reaping the rewards of a
                          story that’s based on real world suffering,” Ahmed, who is also an activist and rapper, said in his
                          acceptance speech. “But if this show has shown a light on some of the prejudice in our society,
                          Islamophobia, some of the injustice in our justice system, then maybe that’s something.

                          mega-deal was all about strengthening Google's capabilities in detecting cyber threats – something
                          Mandiant has become well-known for, said Google Cloud Chief Information Security Officer Phil
                          Venables at a press conference yesterday. “I want to emphasize that this is adding more frontline
                          threat intelligence,” Venables said. “When you look at what we’ve got existing at Google, which
                          includes very complementary things from VirusTotal and our other threat intelligence capabilities,
                          bringing that together really gives us this kind of end-to-end security operations stack. Again,
                          Google Cloud is already strong when we think about how we analyze data and put it in context, and
                          that only gets stronger with Mandiant.” Venables was very clear that Google Cloud's ambitions in
                          cybersecurity are massive, but on some level, the size of the deal already said it all. The
                          acquisition is Google's second-largest ever, surpassed only by the company's $12.5 billion buyout
                          of Motorola ten years ago. The more than $5 billion the company spent on Mandiant overshadows even
                          what Google shelled out for Fitbit, which it bought for $2.1 billion. The timing of this deal also
                          wasn't an accident – it's a response to a changing environment.

                          Mandiant will join Google's cloud computing division, which is yet to grow to the same size as
                          Microsoft Azure or Amazon Web Services. "Organizations around the world are facing unprecedented
                          cybersecurity challenges as the sophistication and severity of attacks that were previously used to
                          target major governments are now being used to target companies in every industry," said Thomas
                          Kurian, CEO of Google Cloud, in a statement. He added: "We look forward to welcoming Mandiant to
                          Google Cloud to further enhance our security operations suite and advisory services, and help
                          customers address their most important security challenges." The deal is expected to close later
                          this year. Shares of Mandiant closed up 16% on Monday after The Information reported that Google
                          was interested in acquiring the company. Mandiant, which has a market value around $5.25 billion,
                          was previously under the FireEye umbrella before that brand was sold. FireEye was credited with
                          helping Microsoft discover the SolarWinds hack that attacked government systems in 2019 and 2020.
                          Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to investors Tuesday, "With cyber attacks increasing by the
                          day and cyber warfare underway from Russia/state sponsored cyber terrorism organizations, Google is
                          doubling down on its cyber security footprint at the right time with Mandiant and looking to
                          differentiate itself from the likes of behemoths Microsoft and Amazon in the cloud arms race.

                          Tears of the Kingdom. In a trailer, Nintendo revealed the new name and the game’s May 12th, 2023
                          release date for the Nintendo Switch. Nintendo didn’t show a lot of specifics about what we can
                          expect in the new trailer, but we did get to see some more action shots of Link in the game. We got
                          a further look at a new Sheikah Slate power that appears to reverse time — Link climbs on top of a
                          rock that begins to fall upwards. Like in a previous trailer, Link takes a few great leaps into the
                          sky, but in one shot, he lands on a new bird-shaped glider of some kind. And there is a brief
                          moment of Link climbing on his own, so it seems as if we’ll be scaling vast vertical obstacles once
                          again. Here’s the official description of the game from Nintendo’s press release: “In addition to
                          the vast lands of Hyrule, the latest entry in the storied Legend of Zelda series will take you up

                          Breath of Duality.” According to Nintendo Life, the report comes from veteran video game journalist
                          Paul Gale “who runs his own website, appeared in Nintendo Power, and worked with many other video
                          game outlets over the years,” according to Nintendo Life. In a post, Gale reports that “the sequel

                          The third trailer for the game was shown in the September 13, 2022 Nintendo Direct, where the
                          title, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, and release date, May 12, 2023, were
                          revealed.[10] However, Nintendo UK did not livestream the Nintendo Direct as a mark of respect
                          during the national period of mourning for Queen Elizabeth II.[11] Nintendo UK later acknowledged
                          the announcement in a Twitter post on October 3rd.[12] Development on the game was confirmed to be
                          complete on March 28, 2023. The announcement of Tears of the Kingdom under the name "Breath of the
                          Wild 2" which Nintendo Called at the time "The Sequel to Breath of the Wild" was celebrated by fans
                          across the world as Breath of the Wild was one of the most popular games on the Nintendo Switch and
                          was known throughout the gaming community, especially after winning the Game of the Year award at
                          the 2017 Japan Game Awards.[13] Many fans speculated about whether Princess Zelda would be a
                          playable character or if multiplayer would be added, but when asked, Aonuma declined to answer.[14]
                          When the title of Tears of the Kingdom was revealed during the September 13, 2022 Nintendo Direct,
                          many fans were unsure whether the name referred to tears as in crying, or tears as in rips.[15]
                          Nintendo cleared up the confusion a few days later and confirmed that the name refers to tears as
                          in crying.

                          “The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom” is perhaps the most highly anticipated video game of
                          the year. (In fact, it won that very award in 2022 – the wait has been long.) And by all accounts,
                          it’s living up to the hype: “Tears of the Kingdom,” released May 12, has already broken sales
                          records, earned raves from experts like IGN and longtime “Zelda” fans, and driven some fans to take
                          time off from work to dive into its intricate, enveloping world. The very first “Zelda” game was
                          released in 1986, and almost 40 years later, Link’s adventures are still enchanting gamers and
                          infuriating those who don’t have over 100 hours to spend discovering the game’s many hidden
                          treasures. Here’s what you need to know about the newest installment in the “Zelda” franchise, sans

                          for Hocus Pocus 2 out of its upfronts presentation, with the studio announcing Tuesday that the
                          movie will hit the Disney+ streaming service on Sept. 30. Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker, and
                          Kathy Najimy — all of whom starred in director Kenny Ortega's 1993 original as the evil Sanderson
                          sisters of Salem — reprised their roles for the sequel, which audiences got a sneak peek at for the
                          first time at Disney's presentation. The rough-cut footage showed two young girls lighting the
                          Black Flame Candle, which summons the central witches as Midler squeals, "Lock up your children!
                          Yes, Salem, we're back!" They then launch into a musical number — a cover of Elton John's "The

                          Richardson also appear. Tony Hale, who plays the mayor of Salem, is also featured in the clip.
                          Specifics are slim on the film's plot, though EW exclusively confirmed that Thora Birch would not

                          feedback LONDON (AP) — Queen Elizabeth II’s funeral and lying-in-state last year cost Britain’s
                          government an estimated 162 million pounds (around $200 million), the treasury revealed Thursday.
                          The state funeral for the late monarch, held on Sept. 19, was the first in the U.K. since that of
                          former Prime Minister Winston Churchill in 1965. The occasion, attended by world leaders and
                          dignitaries, followed 10 days of national mourning after the queen died at age 96 on Sept. 8 after
                          70 years on the throne. Hundreds of thousands of people were drawn to London’s Westminster Hall to
                          see the United Kingdom’s longest-serving monarch lying in state. READ MORE: What to know about

                          safety and security of the public,” said John Glen, chief secretary to the treasury, in a
                          statement. Elizabeth and her husband, Prince Philip, were both interred at St. George’s Chapel in
                          Windsor Castle.

                          (AP) — The United Kingdom and the world bade farewell to Queen Elizabeth II on Monday with a state
                          funeral that drew presidents and kings, princes and prime ministers — and crowds in the streets of
                          London and at Windsor Castle — to honor a monarch whose 70-year reign defined an age. In a country
                          known for pomp and pageantry, the first state funeral since Winston Churchill’s was filled with
                          spectacle: Before the service, a bell tolled 96 times — once a minute for each year of Elizabeth’s
                          life. Then, 142 Royal Navy sailors used ropes to draw the gun carriage carrying her flag-draped
                          coffin to Westminster Abbey, where pallbearers carried it inside and about 2,000 people ranging
                          from world leaders to health care workers gathered to mourn. The trappings of state and monarchy
                          abounded: The coffin was draped with the Royal Standard and atop it was the Imperial State Crown,
                          sparkling with almost 3,000 diamonds, and the sovereign’s orb and scepter. But the personal was
                          also present: The coffin was followed into the church by generations of Elizabeth’s descendants,
                          including King Charles III, heir to the throne Prince William and 9-year-old George, who is second
                          in line.

                          Britain honored the life of Queen Elizabeth II with a state funeral steeped in tradition on Monday.
                          The Queen, the UK's longest-reigning monarch, died September 8 after a rule spanning seven decades.
                          She was 96. The funeral service took place at Westminster Abbey in London, where the Queen was
                          crowned 69 years ago and where she was married to her husband, Prince Philip, 75 years ago.
                          Presidents, prime ministers, princes, an emperor and an empress were among the dignitaries paying
                          their final respects — a testament to the Queen's far-reaching appeal and deft diplomacy. Thousands
                          of people flocked to the Abbey and streets along the 25-mile (40-kilometer) procession route from
                          central London to Windsor, hoping to catch a glimpse of the Queen's flag-draped coffin as it
                          traveled by hearse to her final resting place in St. George's Chapel, within the grounds of Windsor

                          the United Kingdom, was raised over Windsor Castle on Monday as the hearse carrying Queen Elizabeth
                          II's coffin made its way through west London toward Windsor. The standard always flies above any
                          royal castle or palace when the sovereign is there, so it being raised on Monday was a sign that

                          The commendation was followed by a new song composed specifically for the service, the words for
                          which were taken from Romans 8 in the Bible, which includes the line, "Who shall separate us from
                          the love of Christ?" The dean of the abbey then delivered a blessing, and asked those in the
                          ancient church to remain standing for the "Last Post," a trumpet peel by the royal Household
                          Cavalry. Finally, all fell silent. A two-minute national silence was held at 11:55 a.m. local time,
                          or 6:55 a.m. Eastern, to honor the queen. A never-before-seen portrait of Queen Elizabeth II was

                          first woman prime minister on Saturday alongside her cabinet team, giving the country its most
                          right-wing government since World War II. Meloni, head of the nationalist Brothers of Italy, swept
                          to victory in an election last month as part of a coalition that included Forza Italia, led by
                          former premier Silvio Berlusconi, and Matteo Salvini’s League. “I swear to be faithful to the
                          republic,” the 45-year-old Meloni said under the crystal chandeliers of a frescoed chamber, before
                          shaking hands with President Sergio Mattarella. Her government, the 12th this century, replaces a
                          national unity administration led by former European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi. It faces a
                          string of daunting challenges, notably a looming recession, rising energy bills and how to present
                          a united front over the Ukraine war. While Meloni has pledged support for Ukraine, Berlusconi has
                          repeatedly undercut her, earlier this week blaming Kyiv for the Russian invasion and revealing he
                          had exchanged gifts and “sweet letters” with his old friend, Russian President Vladimir Putin.
                          After days of often tense, behind-the-scenes talks, Meloni unveiled her team on Friday, giving five
                          ministries each to her junior partners, the League and Forza Italia, while reserving nine cabinet
                          posts for her own party.

                          to form a new government.[125] She accepted the task and on the same day announced the composition
                          of her cabinet, which was officially sworn in on 22 October.[126][127][128] She is the first woman

Question 166              : What caused Ben Davies to be unavailable for Wales in the upcoming Nations League matches?
Correct Answers         :  
                          Knee, injury
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prediction (only positive):
  - Answer              :  small leg fracture
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          Last updated on 19 September 202219 September 2022.From the section Wales Wales have called up
                          teenage Birmingham City midfielder Jordan James for their Nations League games against Belgium and
                          Poland on 22 and 25 September after injury ruled out Joe Allen. Uncapped James, 18, has played for
                          England Under-20s and was last week included in the Wales Under-21 squad. Senior Wales boss Robert
                          Page has now promoted James to his squad. While a hamstring strain ruled out Allen, defender Ben
                          Davies' small leg fracture forced his absence. Swansea's Allen and Tottenham's Davies picked up the
                          injuries with their clubs. Davies, 29, is expected to be out for around three weeks after suffering
                          his injury in Spurs' Champions League defeat by Sporting Lisbon. Allen came off in Swansea's 3-0
                          Championship win over Hull on Saturday. Wales travel to Belgium on Thursday before hosting Poland
                          three days later. Spurs manager Antonio Conte has said Davies will not be available for Wales duty.
                          "He had an injury in his knee in the game against Sporting Lisbon, and he played with this injury,"
                          Conte told Sky Sports. "It is not a serious injury, I think (he will be back) after the
                          international break because, with the national team, he is not available. "But I think after the

                          Last updated on 19 September 202219 September 2022.From the section Wales Wales have called up
                          teenage Birmingham City midfielder Jordan James for their Nations League games against Belgium and
                          Poland on 22 and 25 September after injury ruled out Joe Allen. Uncapped James, 18, has played for
                          England Under-20s and was last week included in the Wales Under-21 squad. Senior Wales boss Robert
                          Page has now promoted James to his squad. While a hamstring strain ruled out Allen, defender Ben
                          Davies' small leg fracture forced his absence. Swansea's Allen and Tottenham's Davies picked up the
                          injuries with their clubs. Davies, 29, is expected to be out for around three weeks after suffering
                          his injury in Spurs' Champions League defeat by Sporting Lisbon. Allen came off in Swansea's 3-0
                          Championship win over Hull on Saturday. Wales travel to Belgium on Thursday before hosting Poland
                          three days later. Spurs manager Antonio Conte has said Davies will not be available for Wales duty.
                          "He had an injury in his knee in the game against Sporting Lisbon, and he played with this injury,"
                          Conte told Sky Sports. "It is not a serious injury, I think (he will be back) after the
                          international break because, with the national team, he is not available. "But I think after the
                          international break, he will be available for us." Allen, 32, missed the start of the season with a

                          Kyodo News via AP) TOKYO (AP) — Former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was assassinated Friday on a
                          street in western Japan by a gunman who opened fire on him from behind as he delivered a campaign
                          speech — an attack that stunned a nation with some of the strictest gun control laws anywhere. The
                          67-year-old Abe, who was Japan’s longest-serving leader when he resigned in 2020, collapsed
                          bleeding and was airlifted to a nearby hospital in Nara, although he was not breathing and his
                          heart had stopped. He was later pronounced dead after receiving massive blood transfusions,
                          officials said. A hearse carrying Abe’s body left the hospital early Saturday to head back to his
                          home in Tokyo. Abe’s wife Akie lowered her head as the vehicle passed before a crowd of
                          journalists. Nara Medical University emergency department chief Hidetada Fukushima said Abe
                          suffered major damage to his heart, along with two neck wounds that damaged an artery. He never
                          regained his vital signs, Fukushima said. Police at the shooting scene arrested Tetsuya Yamagami,
                          41, a former member of Japan’s navy, on suspicion of murder. Police said he used a gun that was
                          obviously homemade — about 15 inches (40 centimeters) long — and they confiscated similar weapons
                          and his personal computer when they raided his nearby one-room apartment.

  - Source              :
                          Japanese prosecutors on Friday said they have indicted a man suspected of murdering former Prime
                          Minister Shinzo Abe last year in a fatal shooting. Nara prosecutors’ office said in a statement it
                          had indicted Tetsuya Yamagami on murder and firearms charges after Abe was shot dead on July 8
                          while giving a campaign speech on a street in the city. The Nara District Court confirmed to CNN it
                          has received the indictment. Yamagami has been undergoing psychiatric evaluation in Nara since his
                          arrest last year to determine whether he is mentally fit to stand trial, public broadcaster NHK
                          reported. His detention period evaluation expired on Tuesday, NHK added. Yamagami was detained at
                          the scene and admitted to shooting Abe, according to Nara Nishi police. Doctors said the bullet
                          that killed the former prime minister was “deep enough to reach his heart” and that he died from
                          excessive bleeding. Abe, 67, the former Liberal Democratic Party leader and Japan’s longest-serving
                          prime minister, held office from 2006 to 2007 and again from 2012 to 2020, before resigning due to
                          health reasons. His assassination in broad daylight shocked the world and sent shock waves through
                          Japan. World leaders offered their condolences while thousands of mourners gathered in the streets
                          of Tokyo to pay tribute. An elaborate and controversial state funeral was held for Abe in September.

                          82][3][83] At 2:45 pm, a press conference was held by Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, who stated that
                          Abe was in critical condition and that "doctors [were] doing everything they [could]".[84] Abe's
                          wife Akie arrived at the hospital at 4:55 pm.[85] Despite doctors' efforts, Abe was pronounced dead
                          at the hospital at 5:03 pm, around five and a half hours after being shot.[6][86][87] He was 67
                          years old. Hidetada Fukushima, a doctor at the hospital, said the cause of Abe's death was blood
                          loss, despite four hours of blood transfusions that saw the administration of 100 units of
                          blood.[b][89][90] Fukushima said that Abe was hit by two bullets[91] and that one bullet was not
                          found in Abe's body.[92] The police autopsy concluded Abe died from loss of blood after a bullet
                          damaged an artery under his collarbone.[93] Several hours after the assassination, both former
                          prime minister Yoshihide Suga[94] and Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno visited the hospital
                          where Abe's body was being held.[95] The body was subject to a judicial autopsy and departed from
                          the hospital with Abe's widow at 5:55 a.m. on 9 July.

                          After proudly declaring himself a “Derry Girl” and bringing everyone to tears (it’s OK if you cried
                          too), he decided to remain in Derry with his friends. Good news for everyone, because the trailer
                          picks up right where we last left them. If their past mishaps tell us anything about the final
                          season, it’s that no one’s going without an emotional and hilarious bang. Derry Girls Season 3
                          starts streaming Oct. 7. Check out some photos below. Clare Devlin (Nicola Coughlan) is having a
                          plaid moment.

                          Nicola took to Insta to post a cute Polaroid selfie with co-star Louisa Harland, who plays Orla
                          McCool on the show. She placed two rainbow pin badges next to the sweet pic, in what appears to be
                          a heartfelt reference to lesbian character Claire. The actress went on to add the caption, "Goodbye
                          Derry Girls, it’s been quite a ride 🌈," seeming to confirm that filming has indeed finished. We're
                          not crying, you're crying. Filming for Derry Girls season 3 was originally supposed to start in
                          June 2020, but was delayed due to the pandemic. However, on 1 November 2021, Nicola shared another
                          Instagram post featuring a behind-the-scenes snap from set, appearing to make the start of
                          production. Posting a very close-up selfie complete with her character Claire's signature fringe
                          and scrunchie pigtails, Nicola wrote, "Guess who’s back in the house #ReturnOfTheWeeLesbian" - in
                          reference to the season 1 episode which saw Claire come out as a lesbian. While it wasn't 100%
                          clear whether filming had properly started, Nicola certainly seemed to be in costume (hey, maybe
                          she just likes to dress up at home to get into character). While Nicola Coughlan has confirmed that
                          she's returning as Claire, the rest of the main cast will remain the same too.

                          Northern Ireland of President Bill Clinton and First Lady Hillary Clinton, and the Good Friday

  - Source              :
                          The 2022 Japanese Grand Prix (officially known as the Formula 1 Honda Japanese Grand Prix 2022) was
                          a Formula One motor race held on 9 October 2022 at the Suzuka International Racing Course in
                          Suzuka, Japan. Max Verstappen secured his second World Championship title after finishing first, in
                          front of Sergio Pérez and Charles Leclerc. Despite only 28 of the scheduled 53 laps being
                          completed, full points were awarded due to a loophole in the regulations regarding how points
                          should be allocated, with the rules stating that reduced points should only be awarded in shortened
                          races that end under red flag conditions. As this race ended under green flag conditions, this
                          system was not applied. The wording of the sporting regulations was subsequently amended for 2023,
                          so races that do not reach the 75 percent distance are awarded shortened race points regardless of
                          whether a race finishes under red or green flag conditions. The event was held across the weekend
                          of the 7–9 October. It was the eighteenth round of the 2022 Formula One World Championship and the
                          first time the event had been held since 2019, with the 2020 and 2021 races cancelled due to the
                          COVID-19 pandemic. Valtteri Bottas entered as the defending race winner.

                          debut on NBC later this month, and the first official trailer has been released. The Quantum Leap
                          revival follows a new team who has been assembled to restart the Quantum Leap project in the hopes
                          of understanding the mysteries behind the machine and the man who created it. Raymond Lee stars as
                          Dr. Ben Seong, a world-renowned physicist and man of faith who finds himself stuck in the late
                          1980s with amnesia after using the Quantum leap technology on himself. In addition to Raymond Lee,
                          Quantum Leap also stars Caitlin Bassett also stars as Addison, who appears in the form of a
                          hologram only Ben can see or hear; Mason Alexander Park as Ian Wright, who runs the AI unit Ziggy;

                          as Herbert “Magic” Williams, a Vietnam veteran and head of the time travel project at Quantum Leap.
                          The Quantum Leap trailer looks like a lot of fun, but I know most fans are waiting for the
                          inevitable moment when Scott Bakula returns as Sam Beckett. According to Ernie Hudson, the
                          invitation to return as been extended to Scott Bakula to reprise his role. “I’ve always appreciated

                          A terrific choice for the subject of a biopic, with a story as strong as his, Sweetwater looks
                          unmissable for any fans of basketball and beyond. Of course, any great biopic must have a strong
                          lead, and also a strong ensemble cast to hold the movie together. Starring as Nat Clifton in this
                          film is Everett Osborne (Chicago Fire), a terrific casting choice due to him being a former
                          professional basketball player himself. Joining Osborne on screen are the likes of Cary Elwes (Saw)
                          as Ned Irish, Eric Roberts (The Dark Knight) as Judd, Richard Dreyfuss (Jaws) as Maurice Podoloff,
                          Jeremy Piven (Entourage) as Joe Lapchick, and Robert Ri'chard (Coach Carter). Also appearing are
                          former Harlem Globetrotter Kevin Daley, blues musician Gary Clark Jr., and Milwaukee Bucks power
                          forward and center Bobby Portis, alongside Jim Meskimen (Brooklyn Nine-Nine) With a strong cast
                          list and a tale that will resonate thematically due to its subject relevance and truthful nature,
                          Sweetwater looks like one of the best sports biopics to take to our screens in 2023.

                          co-anchor of TODAY at NBC News, as the 2022 Tom Hanks Caregiver Champion Award recipient in
                          recognition of her outstanding support of military caregivers. The award will be presented at the
                          Foundation’s annual Heroes & History Makers celebration, on October 19 at The Anthem in Washington,
                          DC and streamed live. The event is the Foundation’s annual tribute to America’s 5.5 million
                          military caregivers, the loved ones who voluntarily care for wounded, ill, and injured service
                          members and veterans at home. Senator Elizabeth Dole will be joined by Hidden Heroes Campaign Chair
                          Tom Hanks and multi-platinum, global entertainer Chris Young. The Caregiver Champion Award was
                          named for Tom Hanks in recognition of his outstanding support of military caregivers. The award has
                          previously been presented to former First Lady Michelle Obama; music superstar Tim McGraw; and
                          actor and humanitarian Gary Sinise. Guthrie was selected in recognition of her devoted advocacy of
                          those who serve and their families. Since joining the Foundation as a Hidden Heroes Ambassador in
                          2018, Guthrie has used her national platform to bring awareness to the 5.5 million loved ones
                          caring for a wounded, ill, or injured service member at home. “We are thrilled to honor our
                          champion, Savannah, during our 10th anniversary celebration,” said Steve Schwab, CEO of the
                          Elizabeth Dole Foundation.

                          Steve Schwab, CEO of the Elizabeth Dole Foundation, in a news release. “Over the past four years,
                          she has become deeply invested in our cause. She has brought our caregivers’ stories of service and
                          sacrifice into millions of homes across America. And she has gone above and beyond, with such grace
                          and compassion, to speak directly to military caregivers and ensure them that they are not alone.”
                          Dole was the first to call the nation’s attention to the men and women caring for a wounded, ill,
                          or injured service member or veteran at home. Military caregivers face increased emotional and
                          physical stress, financial and legal troubles, employment difficulties, and feelings of isolation
                          due to the enormous responsibility and severe lack of resources for those caring for someone who
                          served. The Foundation is committed to recognizing, supporting, and empowering military caregivers.

  - Source              :
                          Advertisement Supported by By Lisa W. Foderaro The Prospect Park Alliance, the nonprofit group that
                          raises money for and oversees the daily operation of Brooklyn’s most visited park, has appointed a
                          former New York City parks official as its new president. Sue Donoghue, who oversaw Mayor Michael
                          R. Bloomberg’s sustainability and parks blueprint known as PlaNYC, succeeds Emily Lloyd, who left
                          to lead the city’s Department of Environmental Protection for Mayor Bill de Blasio. Ms. Donoghue
                          lives a block from the park. “With three kids, the park is a big part of our daily existence,” said
                          Ms. Donoghue, whose appointment was approved by the alliance’s board on Tuesday evening. “It’s our
                          backyard and front yard.” The Prospect Park Alliance, founded in 1987, was one of the first
                          conservancies that set out to transform a long-neglected park. (The Central Park Conservancy began
                          in 1980.) And with its help, the park has undergone a series of renovation and restoration
                          projects. Last year, the park unveiled the LeFrak Center at Lakeside, a $74 million project that
                          includes two skating rinks; the southeast corner of the park was also restored and redesigned. Like
                          the leaders of several major park conservancies, Ms. Donoghue, 49, will serve as both the
                          alliance’s president and the park’s official administrator for the parks department.

                          studio Fortiche to release an animated series, Arcane. The series was released worldwide in
                          November 2021 on Netflix, and by parent company Tencent in China, and received a favorable critical
                          reception.[39][40] In March 2022, Riot Games announced that it had invested in Fortiche and, as a
                          result, its chief content officer Brian Wright and director of corporate development Brendan
                          Mulligan were joining Fortiche's board of directors.[41] That same month, Riot also hired
                          executives from Netflix, Paramount, and HBO Max to head development of film, TV, and music
                          endeavors built around the company's intellectual property.[42] In October 2022, Riot acquired
                          Wargaming Sydney—a subsidiary of Cyprus-based Wargaming that had originally developed the MMO
                          middleware BigWorld—for an undisclosed amount, and renamed it Riot Sydney. The acquisition excludes
                          rights to the BigWorld technology itself, as well as its publishing arm.[43]

                          C.H. Robinson Worldwide Inc. (NASDAQ: CHRW) has chosen David Bozeman, an executive of the Ford
                          Motor Co., as its next CEO, according to people familiar with the matter. The announcement, which
                          is expected to be made as early as Monday, catapults Bozeman to the top job of the nation’s largest
                          freight broker. Bozeman is currently vice president of the customer services division and
                          enthusiast brands at Ford (NYSE: F). Before joining the automaker last August, Bozeman spent
                          five-plus years as vice president of Amazon Transportation Services. Before that, he spent more
                          than eight years in top positions at Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT) and more than 16 years at
                          Harley-Davidson Motor Co. (NYSE: HOG). The choice of Bozeman may come as a surprise to many who
                          thought that Jim Barber, a former COO at UPS Inc. (NYSE: UPS), to be the odds-on choice for the
                          job. The position has been open since Bob Biesterfeld was let go at the beginning of the year.
                          During its most recent analyst call, Robinson said a decision would be made and announced by the
                          end of June. Company executives were not immediately available for comment. Like virtually all
                          brokers, Robinson has struggled with a sharp downturn in demand. Robinson had also struggled in
                          recent months amid concerns about increased competition from the likes of new broker RXO Inc.
                          (NYSE: RXO).

Question 191              : What is the subscriber growth of Netflix in Q3 2022?
Correct Answers         :  
                          2.41 million
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prediction (only positive):
  - Answer              :  +4.5 percent
  - Threshold           : 0.8

                          Enterprise and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply. Netflix added 2.41 million
                          global subscribers in the third quarter of 2022, bringing its grand total to 223.09 million (73.39
                          million from the U.S. and Canada), a gain of +4.5 percent over the prior year’s comparable quarter.
                          Q3 was the first quarter of 2022 when Netflix didn’t lose subs. According to Tuesday’s shareholder
                          letter, executives at Netflix believe they’ll add 4.50 million subs globally in the final quarter
                          of 2022. The streamer added 4.38 million subs in the year-ago quarter, which at the time
                          represented 9.4 percent growth. So we’re not there — but we are well above the company’s tempered
                          expectations; at the end of Q2, Netflix forecasted that it would add 1 million global subscribers
                          in Q3. Clearly, it bested that — the same goes for its financial forecasts. Netflix earned $3.10
                          per share in the third quarter on $7.926 billion in revenue; its net income was $1.398 billion.
                          Wall Street forecasted earnings of $2.13 per share on $7.84 billion in revenue. Back on July 19,
                          Netflix itself estimated Q3 earnings per share of $2.

                          the version of its ad-free, offline-viewing and music subscription service that provides access to
                          up to six accounts. In the U.S., the price of YouTube Premium Family has gone up from $17.99 to

Question 194              : What is the release date of God of War Ragnarok?
Correct Answers         :

  - Source              :
                          God of War Ragnarök is an action-adventure game developed by Santa Monica Studio and published by
                          Sony Interactive Entertainment. It was released worldwide on November 9, 2022, for both the
                          PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5, marking the first cross-gen release in the God of War series. It
                          is the ninth installment in the series, the ninth chronologically, and the sequel to 2018's God of
                          War. Loosely based on Norse mythology, the game is set in ancient Scandinavia and features series
                          protagonist, Kratos, and his now teenage son, Atreus. Concluding the Norse era of the series, the
                          game covers Ragnarök, the eschatological event which is central to Norse mythology and was foretold
                          to happen in the previous game after Kratos killed the Aesir god Baldur. The gameplay is similar to
                          the previous 2018 installment. It features combo-based combat, as well as puzzle and role-playing
                          elements. The gameplay has been revamped from the previous game: in addition to Kratos' main
                          weapons, a magical battle axe and his double-chained blades, he also acquires a magical spear and
                          his shield has become more versatile, with different types of shields that have differing offensive
                          and defensive abilities. His son Atreus, as well as some other characters, provide assistance in
                          combat and can be passively controlled.

  - Source              :
                          The animated series is set to premiere next month. Ethan Hawke is Batman in a new clip from the
                          upcoming animated series Batwheels, as he races against the Joker on the rain-slicked, CG streets
                          of Gotham City. Fittingly for the vehicular nature of the series, it displays the abilities of both
                          the Batmobile and the Joker's gaudily-decorated van. In this preschool-aimed series, the first from
                          DC, Batman is assisted in his never-ending crusade against crime by a squad of sentient,
                          super-powered vehicles, the titular Batwheels. They include the Bam, the Batmobile (Jacob
                          Bertrand), Bibi, the Batgirl Cycle (Madigan Kacmar), Redbird, Robin's Sports Car (Jordan Reed),
                          Batwing, the Jet Plane (Lilimar), and Buff, the Bat Truck (Noah Bentley). Newly granted sentience
                          by the Batcomputer (Kimberly D. Brooks), the child-like Batwheels will learn about the world around
                          them as well as the ins and outs of fighting super villains starting this fall, under the
                          Cartoonito brand streaming on HBO Max and broadcast on Cartoon Network. Ethan Hawke has been
                          ubiquitous lately, turning up in the sleeper horror hit The Black Phone, in the
                          critically-acclaimed The Northman, and in Marvel's Moon Knight. He is a newcomer to the world of
                          animation, with only a single guest voice on an episode of Robot Chicken to his name.

                          definitely reminded me of shows I grew up watching like Thomas the Tank Engine. I’m curious how
                          this show came about? Michael G. Stern: DC and Warner Bros. Animation had wanted to find a way to
                          connect young kids to their heroes and they had sort of been struggling to do it. They brought me

                          The animated series is set to premiere next month. Ethan Hawke is Batman in a new clip from the
                          upcoming animated series Batwheels, as he races against the Joker on the rain-slicked, CG streets
                          of Gotham City. Fittingly for the vehicular nature of the series, it displays the abilities of both
                          the Batmobile and the Joker's gaudily-decorated van. In this preschool-aimed series, the first from
                          DC, Batman is assisted in his never-ending crusade against crime by a squad of sentient,
                          super-powered vehicles, the titular Batwheels. They include the Bam, the Batmobile (Jacob
                          Bertrand), Bibi, the Batgirl Cycle (Madigan Kacmar), Redbird, Robin's Sports Car (Jordan Reed),
                          Batwing, the Jet Plane (Lilimar), and Buff, the Bat Truck (Noah Bentley). Newly granted sentience
                          by the Batcomputer (Kimberly D. Brooks), the child-like Batwheels will learn about the world around
                          them as well as the ins and outs of fighting super villains starting this fall, under the
                          Cartoonito brand streaming on HBO Max and broadcast on Cartoon Network. Ethan Hawke has been
                          ubiquitous lately, turning up in the sleeper horror hit The Black Phone, in the
                          critically-acclaimed The Northman, and in Marvel's Moon Knight. He is a newcomer to the world of
                          animation, with only a single guest voice on an episode of Robot Chicken to his name.

Question 196              : Who is the new prime minister of the United Kingdom?
Correct Answers         :  
                          Rishi Sunak
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - Source              :
                          The former chancellor wins Conservative Party leadership contest days after the dramatic
                          resignation of Liz Truss as prime minister. Rishi Sunak will become the United Kingdom’s new prime
                          minister after winning the ruling Conservative Party’s leadership contest, which was triggered by
                          the resignation of Liz Truss last week. Sunak’s win on Monday came days after Truss’s resignation
                          after her disastrous tax cuts plans and policy U-turns plunged the markets into chaos. The
                          unprecedented economic crisis drew a rare intervention from the Bank of England. Britain faces
                          serious economic challenges and needs stability and unity, Sunak said on Monday in his first public
                          speech since winning the contest. “There is no doubt we face a profound economic challenge,” Sunak
                          said. “We now need stability and unity, and I will make it my utmost priority to bring our party
                          and our country together.” Sunak, a former finance minister, has been left with the task of
                          steering a deeply divided country through an economic downturn set to make millions of people
                          poorer. Al Jazeera’s Andrew Simmons, reporting from London, said Sunak is “pretty well placed”
                          despite the challenges ahead. “In some ways, … some of his work has already been done in terms of
                          putting out the fires that Liz Truss created because it did cause a storm in the markets,” Simmons
                          said.

  - Source              :
                          “The whole list of tax cuts and ideas that frankly, according to Sunak and others, belongs to
                          Disneyland because none of it was going to be really possible without crashing the economy more,”
                          he said. Sunak’s only challenger, Penny Mordaunt, leader of the House of Commons and former defence
                          minister, was reportedly backed by 30 MPs compared with nearly 150 supporting Sunak. “This decision
                          is an historic one and shows, once again, the diversity and talent of our party,” Mordaunt said in
                          a statement as she withdrew from the race just minutes before the winner was due to be announced.
                          “Rishi has my full support.” Sunak and Mordaunt had lost to Truss last month in the race to appoint
                          a successor to then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson. He was forced to announce his resignation in July
                          after a wave of scandals linked to parties held during the COVID-19 lockdown. Sunak will be the
                          UK’s first leader of colour and the first Hindu to take the top job. At 42, he will also be the
                          youngest prime minister in more than 200 years. The multimillionaire former hedge fund boss will be
                          expected to impose deep spending cuts to try to rebuild the UK’s fiscal reputation, just as the
                          country slides into a recession, dragged down by the surging costs of energy and food. He will also
                          inherit a political party that has fractured along ideological lines, a challenge that damaged the
                          fortunes of several former Conservative leaders.

                          110] On 22 October, it was reported that Sunak had the required number of supporters—100 members of
                          the House of Commons—to run in the ballot on 24 October. The total number of MPs who publicly
                          declared support passed 100 on the afternoon of 22 October.[111] On 23 October, Sunak declared that
                          he would stand for election.[112] After Johnson ruled himself out of the race and Penny Mordaunt
                          withdrew her candidacy, Sunak was announced as the new Conservative leader on 24 October.[113]
                          Following Truss's resignation, Sunak, as the Leader of the Conservative Party, became prime
                          minister on 25 October 2022, after accepting King Charles III's invitation to form a
                          government.[114] He is both the first British Asian and the first Hindu prime minister of the
                          United Kingdom. In his first speech as prime minister, Sunak promised "integrity, professionalism
                          and accountability," and said that "we will create a future worthy of the sacrifices so many have
                          made and fill tomorrow, and everyday thereafter with hope."[115] Of his predecessor, Sunak said
                          that Truss "was not wrong" to want to improve growth, but admitted that "some mistakes were made",
                          and that he was elected prime minister in part to fix them. He promised to "place economic
                          stability and confidence at the heart of this government's agenda".[116] Sunak began to appoint his
                          cabinet on 25 October 2022.

                          Sunak won the race to be Britain's next prime minister Monday, the first British Asian to assume
                          the role and the third leader in seven weeks of a country roiled by political and economic chaos.
                          Sunak will become the latest leader of the ruling Conservative Party to enter the revolving door of
                          No. 10 Downing St., following Liz Truss' resignation just 44 days after taking office. Her
                          scandal-plagued predecessor, Boris Johnson, dropped his bid for a comeback Sunday. In his first
                          public statement after the results were announced, Sunak said the country faces a “profound
                          economic challenge.” He went on to pledge to work for “stability and unity,” and added that he
                          would make it his “utmost priority” to unite the party and the country. Sunak’s victory was
                          confirmed after his only other challenger, Penny Mordaunt, failed to secure the support of enough
                          of her fellow lawmakers before the deadline. "Rishi Sunak is therefore elected as leader of the
                          Conservative Party," Graham Brady, the Conservative lawmaker who oversees the party's leadership
                          elections, told his colleagues, who banged on tables and cheered at the announcement.

                          (born May 12, 1980, Southampton, England), British politician and financier who became leader of
                          the Conservative Party and prime minster of the United Kingdom in October 2022. Previously he
                          served as chancellor of the Exchequer (2020–22). Sunak was born into a family with immigrant roots.
                          His grandparents emigrated from Punjab, in northwestern India, to East Africa, where his mother and
                          father were born in Tanzania and Kenya, respectively. They met and married after their families
                          migrated in the 1960s to Southampton in southern England. Sunak’s father became a general
                          practitioner for the National Health Service. His mother, a pharmacist, owned and operated a small
                          pharmacy, for which Sunak, the eldest of their three children, would eventually keep the books.
                          Later, during his political career, Sunak would draw parallels between his experiences working in
                          the family business and the values he gained from them and those of Conservative Party icon
                          Margaret Thatcher, the daughter of a grocer. As a result of his parents’ sacrifices and saving to
                          fund his education, Sunak was able to attend Winchester College, the exclusive private school that
                          has produced no fewer than six chancellors of the Exchequer.

Question 198              : How much does the Netflix Basic with Ads subscription cost?
Correct Answers         :  
                          6.99
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prediction (only positive):
  - Answer              :  $6.99 per month,
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          Related Stories Move over "Stranger Things," the next big Netflix hit may just be commercials. The
                          streaming giant on Thursday is rolling out its cheapest membership tier, dubbed "Basic With Ads."
                          The new tier will cost $6.99 per month, which makes it a full $3 cheaper than Netflix's current
                          cheapest plan, the $9.99 Basic plan. It's Netflix's first foray into the ad-supported space — the
                          streamer has for years resisted putting any advertising on its platform. The company's plan arrives
                          on Nov. 3, a month before rival streaming service Disney+ will introduce its own ad-supported tier,
                          and competes with ad-supported plans from services like Hulu and Peacock. The plan's launch comes
                          as Netflix is preparing to crack down on password sharing on its platform. Beginning next year,
                          Netflix will push people who borrow accounts to create their own, and will also give
                          account-holders who share their passwords the ability to pay extra to have friends and family on
                          their accounts. Here's what you need to know about Netflix's Basic With Ads tier. The Basic With
                          Ads plan will operate similarly to the Basic plan. Users will have access to a 720p video stream —
                          versus the 1080p stream offered by the $15.49 Standard plan and the 4K plan offered by the $19.99
                          Premium plan — which can be accessed from any internet-connected device.

                          Related Stories Move over "Stranger Things," the next big Netflix hit may just be commercials. The
                          streaming giant on Thursday is rolling out its cheapest membership tier, dubbed "Basic With Ads."
                          The new tier will cost $6.99 per month, which makes it a full $3 cheaper than Netflix's current
                          cheapest plan, the $9.99 Basic plan. It's Netflix's first foray into the ad-supported space — the
                          streamer has for years resisted putting any advertising on its platform. The company's plan arrives
                          on Nov. 3, a month before rival streaming service Disney+ will introduce its own ad-supported tier,
                          and competes with ad-supported plans from services like Hulu and Peacock. The plan's launch comes
                          as Netflix is preparing to crack down on password sharing on its platform. Beginning next year,
                          Netflix will push people who borrow accounts to create their own, and will also give
                          account-holders who share their passwords the ability to pay extra to have friends and family on
                          their accounts. Here's what you need to know about Netflix's Basic With Ads tier. The Basic With
                          Ads plan will operate similarly to the Basic plan. Users will have access to a 720p video stream —
                          versus the 1080p stream offered by the $15.49 Standard plan and the 4K plan offered by the $19.99
                          Premium plan — which can be accessed from any internet-connected device.

                          continue to rule, with the series returning for a fifth season on November 9. In 2020, showrunner
                          Peter Morgan said they initially planned to end the series after season 5, but that pretty soon it
                          “became clear that in order to do justice to the richness and complexity of the story, we should go

                          (sorry to fans hoping to see a fictionalized Harry and Meghan!), it will allow them to dive into
                          the same time period in greater detail. Naturally, The Crown has always hewed close to real life,
                          with the series beginning in the early days of Queen Elizabeth II’s reign and later delving into
                          events like the death of Winston Churchill, her strained relationship with Margaret Thatcher, and
                          the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana. Season five will tackle the ’90s and feature a whole
                          new star-studded cast. Here’s everything else we know about The Crown season five so far. The fifth
                          season of The Crown is currently streaming on Netflix.

                          Colman. Given everything that's been happening in the royal family in the last few years—including
                          Queen Elizabeth's death in September, Harry and Meghan stepping back from their royal roles, and
                          the controversy surrounding Prince Andrew—fans of The Crown have been anticipating a season set in
                          the modern day. Though the series likely won't make it all the way to 2022, the critically
                          acclaimed show will have a few more chapters. Season 5 of the critically acclaimed series premiered
                          in full on Netflix in November 2022, and is now nominated for four Golden Globes, including a
                          nomination for Best Drama Series, as well as Imelda Staunton for Best Television Actress in a Drama
                          Series, Elizabeth Debicki for Best Supporting Actress in a Television Series, and Jonathan Pryce
                          for Best Supporting Actor in a Television Series. Staunton's nomination, in particular, has fans
                          excited—if she wins, all three of the actresses who have helmed the show in the role of Queen
                          Elizabeth II will have garnered the Best Actress Golden Globe. Watch The Crown In October 2022,

                          Sure, all most of the characters are horrible people and on the verge of murdering each other
                          and/or getting murdered, but looking at the gorgeous scenery and luxurious hotel is not a crime and

                          While The White Lotus was originally intended to be a standalone miniseries, the overwhelmingly
                          positive reception and acclaim inspired White to utilize the anthology format to create another
                          installment. Amidst the buzz around Season 2, HBO confirmed that the series had been renewed for
                          another season. There haven’t been any details about returning cast members, but based on the
                          Season 2 finale, we can guess that Tanya won’t be among them. While filming has not yet begun,
                          White has teased that he’s interested in exploring "death and Eastern religion and spirituality."
                          Considering that the show has already ventured to an American state and a European resort, creating
                          a new installment set in Asia would certainly allow the series to go in a different direction. The
                          first two seasons of The White Lotus are now available to stream on HBO Max. Liam Gaughan is a film

                          in the House and 35 of 100 seats in the Senate were on the ballot, as well as several influential
                          gubernatorial elections in battleground states like Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
                          Democrats were defending their narrow majorities in both chambers and retained control of the
                          Senate, though control of the House isn't yet clear. But a Republican flip of the lower chamber
                          would be enough to curtail most of President Joe Biden's legislative agenda and would likely result

                          VEGAS (AP) — With control of the U.S. Senate on the line, Nevada’s protracted ballot count ground
                          through a fourth day Friday as election officials tallied thousands of votes ahead of a Saturday
                          deadline to accept late-arriving mail-ins. Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto was running
                          barely behind Republican Adam Laxalt, but with the remaining tens of thousands of uncounted ballots
                          mainly coming from the state’s urban cores, her campaign expressed optimism she could overtake her
                          challenger. Laxalt, meanwhile, has steadily predicted he’ll stay in the lead as the count drags on.
                          “We are doing everything in our power to move ballots forward just as quickly as we can,” Joe
                          Gloria, the registrar in Clark County, which includes Las Vegas, said at a press conference Friday.
                          Gloria’s office posted tabulations Friday evening for more than 27,000 ballots that put Cortez
                          Masto within a few hundred votes of Laxalt, with an estimated 23,000 more votes in heavily
                          Democratic Clark County yet to be tallied.

                          the new cast of the series and those destined to become known for their time in the blue box.
                          Initially, Davies revealed Yasmin Finney (Heartstopper) as the new companion, whose name is once
                          again Rose. Viewers initially assumed Finney was meant for both the 60th anniversary and beyond.
                          But with three specials, which Gatwa may not be a significant part of, it seems her time is
                          Tennant-based. The actual companion paired with Gatwa will be Ruby Sunday, played by Millie Gibson
                          (Coronation Street). A post shared by Doctor Who (@bbcdoctorwho) Gibson, 18, is officially the
                          youngest companion the show has featured to date. (Before her, Fourth and Fifth Doctor companion
                          Adric, played by 19-year-old Matthew Waterhouse, was the youngest ever.) This is notable for
                          several reasons, but the biggest is that the companion is usually the audience avatar. With a
                          literal teenager as the Doctor's companion, it seems like Davies is hoping to reboot the show for
                          Generation Z, a theory backed by the decision to pull it off of BBC America after more than a
                          decade and put the series on the much younger-skewing Disney+. Filming for Doctor Who Season 14 is
                          expected to get underway at Bad Wolf Studios in Cardiff in the coming weeks.

                          continuity or just the fact that they do not see themselves reflected. There is an entire
                          generation now that was born after the revival and likely weren't even alive when David Tennant
                          played the Doctor last. It is time for Doctor Who to stop chasing the old fans who may have left,
                          and start trying to cultivate a new fanbase. The original fans will return if the stories are good,
                          just like they did before. For Doctor Who to continue to survive, much like the title character it
                          needs to reinvent itself, and casting Gibson as the companion is a step in the right direction.

                          Generation Z, a theory backed by the decision to pull it off of BBC America after more than a
                          decade and put the series on the much younger-skewing Disney+. Filming for Doctor Who Season 14 is
                          expected to get underway at Bad Wolf Studios in Cardiff in the coming weeks.

                          /aIEatnDQhm To her rehearsal dinner at the Renwick Gallery, Naomi Biden wore a Danielle Frankel
                          gown. "This is a White House wedding, so there’s regard for the White House and for our country,
                          but also for the sanctity of the wedding. We wanted to pay tribute to all of those components while
                          still showcasing who Naomi is, respectful but sophisticated with a tinge of femininity," Frankel
                          explained. "She’s young and cool. Wearing the cape and the tulle is reminiscent of wearing a gown
                          but has an ethereal quality that creates something grand and a sense of importance in that moment.
                          For the rehearsal dinner, she’ll swap out the cape for the jacket, which is a more tailored,
                          commanding clean look. We wanted to create a different moment and shift into the evening." For her
                          reception, Naomi changed into an ivory strapless silk gown designed by Reem Acra, which included
                          her grandmother Roberta Buhle’s pearls sewn into the train, and then slipped into a custom beaded
                          fringed mini dress by Markarian. She also wore tulle gloves, and her ceremony earrings. Naomi and
                          Peter became the first members of the President's family to tie the knot at 1600 Pennsylvania
                          Avenue since President Richard Nixon's daughter Tricia married Edward Cox in the Rose Garden in
                          June 1971.

  - Source              :
                          Group C of the 2022 FIFA World Cup took place from 22 to 30 November 2022.[1] The group consisted
                          of eventual champions Argentina, Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Poland. The top two teams, Argentina and
                          Poland, advanced to the round of 16. This marked the first time that Mexico did not advance past
                          the first round since 1978.[2] The teams were decided by the World Cup draw that took place on 1
                          April 2022.[3] The group was set to receive one team from each pot, which sorted all World Cup
                          teams by position on the FIFA World Rankings.[3] Notes The first match of the group was between
                          Argentina and Saudi Arabia. The two teams had faced each other four times prior to the tournament,
                          most recently in 2012, a 0–0 draw in a friendly game. Saudi Arabia defeated Argentina and ended
                          their 36-match unbeaten streak.[6] According to Gracenote, the win was the "most surprising" in
                          World Cup history, with many calling it one of the biggest World Cup upsets in history.[7] This was
                          also the second consecutive time that Argentina did not win their opening match at a World Cup,
                          after drawing 1–1 with Iceland in 2018; and the first time since 1990 that Argentina lost their
                          opening match.

                          Group C of the 2022 FIFA World Cup took place from 22 to 30 November 2022.[1] The group consisted
                          of eventual champions Argentina, Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Poland. The top two teams, Argentina and
                          Poland, advanced to the round of 16. This marked the first time that Mexico did not advance past
                          the first round since 1978.[2] The teams were decided by the World Cup draw that took place on 1
                          April 2022.[3] The group was set to receive one team from each pot, which sorted all World Cup
                          teams by position on the FIFA World Rankings.[3] Notes The first match of the group was between
                          Argentina and Saudi Arabia. The two teams had faced each other four times prior to the tournament,
                          most recently in 2012, a 0–0 draw in a friendly game. Saudi Arabia defeated Argentina and ended
                          their 36-match unbeaten streak.[6] According to Gracenote, the win was the "most surprising" in
                          World Cup history, with many calling it one of the biggest World Cup upsets in history.[7] This was
                          also the second consecutive time that Argentina did not win their opening match at a World Cup,
                          after drawing 1–1 with Iceland in 2018; and the first time since 1990 that Argentina lost their
                          opening match.

Question 210              : What is the title of the new season of "Criminal Minds"?
Correct Answers         :

                          "This is the biggest case we've ever had," Rossi says. On Sept. 9, Paramount announced the series
                          would be known as Criminal Minds: Evolution. The name seems like a good indication that the series
                          will be heading in a new direction. "The series never stopped evolving during its run, and we are
                          beyond excited to bring it back into a new era with new stories for a new generation of viewers at
                          Paramount+," said Nicole Clemens, Paramount+'s President of Original Scripted Series. "Erica
                          [Messner], the whole cast and creative team are building a season full of new twists that we are
                          sure will electrify audiences." It just wouldn't be the same without the familiar faces that we
                          came to know and love over the course of 15 seasons, so luckily most of them will be back for the
                          revival— not all of them, though, which we'll get to in a moment. Paramount+ announced Friday Night
                          Lights alum Zach Gilford as the first new cast member to be joining the series in a recurring role
                          throughout the season. Gilford is trading in his good-guy persona and will play Elias Voit, an
                          analyst for a cyber-security firm who has a dark side and an obsession with death. Unlike past
                          unsubs, Voit will be explored in an ongoing arc for 10 episodes. "To tell a slightly different
                          story [about this unsub] is really exciting," star Paget Brewster told journalists on Sept.

                          21. Notably missing from the cast list is fan favorite Matthew Gray Gubler, who will not be
                          returning as genius FBI Special Agent Dr. Spencer Reid in the first batch of episodes. He and
                          Season 13 addition Daniel Henney (Special Agent Matt Simmons) couldn't make their schedules work to
                          be series regulars for this season, but the door is open for them to return in the future.
                          Showrunner Erica Messer said that Spencer and Matt are mysteriously absent but "not forgotten" this
                          season, according to TV Line. "Dr. Reid's and I believe Matt Simmons' desks are still there, still
                          have stuff on it…," she said. "Like, if any of you went back [to the office after the pandemic],
                          you still have stuff on your desk that was there for two years. So we're definitely playing that.
                          But [Spencer and Matt] are not gone gone." Hopefully they'll be back for Season 2. This fresh new
                          series will pick up where the original left off and is set in post-Covid-19 times. Unlike the cable
                          TV show, the streaming version will follow one storyline across the whole season, instead of a new
                          case in each episode. The official logline says the FBI's elite team of criminal profilers will
                          come up against their greatest threat yet, an unsub named Elias Voit who has used the pandemic to
                          build a network of other serial killers.

                          & Reporter Nebraska Public Media Nov. 26, 2022, 10 a.m. · Matt Rhule will be the next Nebraska
                          football head coach. Athletic Director Trev Alberts made the announcement Saturday morning,
                          following Nebraska's close win over the Iowa Hawkeyes Friday. Rhule signed an 8-year contract to
                          take over the struggling Nebraska football program. He will be formally introduced in a news
                          conference Monday at Memorial Stadium. In a news release Saturday morning, Alberts pointed to
                          Rhule's record at Temple University and Baylor University as "evidence of Rhule's ability to build
                          a program and made him an ideal fit at Nebraska." Rhule was most recently the head coach for the
                          NFL Carolina Panthers team, where he was released after a 1-4 start. He's credited for improving
                          the football programs at both Baylor and Temple while serving as a head coach. While coaching at
                          Temple from 2013 to 2016, Rhule and the Owls won 28 games. The head coach took the Owls from a
                          2-win season in 2013 to racking up a 10-4 record in 2015. In his last season with Temple, Rhule led
                          the team to a 10-3 record and an American Athletic Conference championship — the first football
                          conference title in 49 years for the school.

                          "Matt is detail-oriented, his teams are disciplined and play a physical brand of football. Matt
                          also has the personality and relationship-building skills to build a great staff and excel in
                          recruiting." Rhule is taking the helm following the firing of Scott Frost and the promotion of
                          Mickey Joseph as interim coach. Each of those announcements occurred on September 11 – the day
                          after Nebraska lost to Georgia Southern. Joseph is the first Black head coach in the history of
                          Husker Athletics. In the news release Saturday, Alberts made no mention of what would happen to
                          Joseph. Frost was fired because of his 16-31 record as the coach, Alberts said at the announcement
                          back in September. Starting in 2018, Frost coached four seasons and also three games this year
                          before getting fired. Frost’s buyout provides him $15 million. Trev Alberts said Joseph would have
                          a chance to win the full-time job but that he also would conduct a national search. Rhule is taking
                          on a team that has had little to celebrate in recent seasons. Nebraska hasn’t made a bowl game
                          since 2016, which is the longest drought among teams in the nation’s five biggest conferences.
                          Alberts previously said following the announcement of Frost’s firing that expectations may be
                          lower. “We will stop talking about championships or stop talking about things we used to do,” he
                          said.

                          tell you guys: It is me,” Callaghan said in her authentic voice. In the caption, she explained that
                          she has an awesome ongoing relationship with TikTok. “The coolest part for me is watching the
                          creativity & awesome content that people are putting out there using my voice,” Callaghan wrote.
                          The video received over 29.4 million views. Some were in shock, but not everyone believed she was
                          the voice they had heard for so long.

                          business. The plan was confirmed by the entertainment firm to CNBC on December 1. SM Entertainment
                          founder Lee Soo-man told The CNBC Conversation last month that the plan could see the creation of a
                          new K-Pop group called NCT Singapore, although it is unclear if it could come to fruition. Lee, who

                          in a speech at Stanford University in May. Lee is often credited for bringing K-Pop to the world’s

                          Unlike group-stage games, knockout round games go to a 30-minute overtime period (two 15-minute
                          periods) if they end in a draw. If there’s still no winner, a best-of-five penalty shootout will be
                          played.

                          The 2014 World Cup winners have many young players in their squad. Hansi Flick’s arrival is
                          definitely an upgrade but the players are taking time to adapt to his style of play. Nonetheless,
                          it will be an interesting match because Germany have players like Sane, Gnabry, Muller and even
                          Gotze with them. Besides Argentina, Brazil are the most favoured candidates to win the 2022 FIFA
                          World Cup. It would not be surprising to see Brazil defeat Argentina as well. Brazil lost to
                          Argentina in the Copa America final and ever since then, they are unbeaten in 15 matches. Brazil
                          have failed to make it past three Quarter-Finals over the past four World Cups. Neymar, Brazil’s
                          star player is key for all of their fixtures. The PSG superstar is in great form and is arguably
                          the most essential player for Brazil in the 2022 FIFA World Cup. If Argentina do face Brazil in the
                          Semi-finals, surely Neymar and Messi will play a prominent role to win the match for their home
                          nation. This will surely be one of the best matches in the 2022 FIFA World Cup if it happens. For

                          Barbies, which would involve playing games with Scott [Evans] and Ncuti [Gatwa],” she said. She
                          later added, "Barbie is light and funny and silly and American and pink." Rest assured, it won't
                          make you cry. "It’s very unexpected in many ways," Mackey said. I think people are going to have an
                          idea of the film, and I don’t think it’s going to be that. It’s going to be a surprise. And it’s a
                          comedy, thank God. No crying in this film! Let me tell you that. No crying!

                          officially on the way. No, we’re not talking about Barbie in the 12 Dancing Princesses or Barbie
                          and the Diamond Castle — we’re getting a real, live-action version featuring Margot Robbie in all
                          of her pink-on-pink glory. Mattel and Warner Bros. are partnering to bring this ~iconic~ character
                          to life for the first time with Margot Robbie both starring in and producing the film. That's a
                          GirlBoss™ if we've ever seen one, which is fitting because Barbie herself has clocked hours at over
                          200 jobs, according to Mattel. Margot spoke to Marc Malkin at Variety, saying that “I think it’s a
                          great opportunity to put some positivity out in the world and a chance to be aspirational for
                          younger kids.” Warner Bros. released the first teaser image back in May, and spoiler alert, it’s
                          completely adorable. We’re screaming, crying, and throwing up over Barbie's bright pink convertible

                          future (tiny plastic shoes not included). In the meantime, here is everything we know so far about
                          the upcoming Barbie movie. Finally!

Question 220              : Who is the captain of the USA soccer team in the FIFA Men's World Cup 2022?

                          Tyler Adams will captain the US men’s national team into the 2022 FIFA World Cup, head coach Gregg
                          Berhalter announced on the eve of Monday’s Group B opener vs. Wales (2 pm ET | FOX, Telemundo). The
                          Leeds United midfielder and New York Red Bulls homegrown product will be the USMNT’s youngest
                          captain since Walter Bahr at the 1950 World Cup. He’s already worn the armband nine times during 32
                          career international appearances. “We think he has great leadership capabilities,” Berhalter said
                          of the 23-year-old Wappingers Falls, New York native. “He leads by his actions and his words.” FIFA
                          requires teams to name a singular captain for the tournament; the USMNT were the last of 32
                          Qatar-qualified squads to complete that task. During Berhalter’s tenure, the USMNT have relied on a
                          leadership council and rotating armband responsibilities. Chelsea forward Christian Pulisic and
                          Nashville SC center back Walker Zimmerman were other leading candidates to be named captain. “A lot
                          of credit to my teammates,” Adams said, “because anyone throughout our leadership council can wear
                          that armband and represent us with pride and represent us in the right way." Adams debuted for the
                          Red Bulls in 2016 before moving to Europe in the winter of 2019, then to German Bundesliga side RB
                          Leipzig.

                          Other players in this squad have served as captain, but the role is a perfect fit for Adams. "I
                          thought it was brilliant," said center-back Tim Ream about Adams' astute handling of Monday's news
                          conference. "It's what it is. That's the world we're living in right now, and for him to handle it
                          with the poise that he did and the sincerity that he did, I think was fantastic for a 23-year-old."
                          Adams followed that up with the kind of impressive performance for the US that has become the norm,
                          putting in his usual robust shift in the center of midfield, and leading the Americans to a 1-0
                          victory over Iran that clinched passage to the knockout stage. Now a round-of-16 matchup against
                          the Netherlands awaits. "Tyler's a beast, man," US right-back Shaq Moore said. "He sets the tone
                          for us with the ball, without the ball, getting stuck in, intensity. He's a big part of our team.
                          I'm happy to have him." Leaders are made, not born, or so the saying goes. Certainly Adams'
                          parents, Melissa Russo and Daryl Sullivan, played a huge role in molding him into the person he is,
                          but he also played against older players throughout his youth career, and when he got to the New
                          York Red Bulls, drew inspiration from the captains he had there.

                          for everything from gas to eggs hammering households, Costco played the role of trusted friend. The
                          retail warehouse giant opted not to raise the cost of a membership even as rival Sam’s Club did.
                          Costco served up some of the cheapest gas prices in town when prices at the pump were sizzling in

                          despite biting price hikes from vendors. To top it off, the Issaquah, Washington based retailer
                          kept the price of its legendary $1.50 hot dog intact and continued to offer employees among the
                          best compensation packages in all of retail. For its efforts, Costco was rewarded with impressive

                          “Worst Company of the Year.” Despite a stock down XX% this year, concerns over its debt load, and

                          we're the low price leader. Our markup's about 13%. So any rebate money we get, we pass right on to

                          when you start to see container costs coming from Asia, I think in non-food, the container costs
                          are starting to bring prices down. Because transportation is starting to come down. There's still a
                          shortage of things like eggs. I don't see the egg market deflating at the moment. BRIAN SOZZI:

Question 223              : Who won the Maxwell Award 2022 in college football?

                          NCAAF 47 USC quarterback Caleb Williams won the 2022 Maxwell Award on Thursday, given to the best
                          player in college football. Here’s what you need to know: Williams was the best quarterback in
                          America this season, so the Maxwell Award was deserved. Williams led USC’s turnaround from a
                          four-win team to a top-10 squad in 2022 and elevated the players around him. Now his sights turn to
                          Saturday night and the Heisman Trophy. — Morales Duggan’s story has been one of the best in college
                          football, starting TCU’s season as the backup quarterback before leading the Horned Frogs to a 12-0
                          start. His toughness and perseverance helped pull the Frogs out of multiple second-half deficits
                          and without his poise, leadership and production late in games, TCU wouldn’t be in the College
                          Football Playoff. Winning the O’Brien and being a Heisman finalist are both well-deserved honors
                          for Duggan. — Khan Chuck Bednarik Award – Defensive Player of the Year Biletnikoff Award –

                          Cup after their sensational victory over Portugal on Saturday. African countries have been
                          competing at the World Cup since 1934 — Egypt withdrew in 1930 after missing their connecting ship
                          to Uruguay as a result of a storm — and have made a total of 49 appearances in the competition.

                          Tunisia in the north to South Africa at the very southern tip of the continent. The Athletic takes

                          Time (UTC+2). The tournament match schedule was announced in November 2007.[73][74] In the first
                          round, or group stage, the 32 teams were divided into eight groups of four, with each team playing
                          the other three teams in their group once. Teams were awarded three points for a win, one point for
                          a draw and none for a defeat. The top two teams in each group advanced to the round of 16. The
                          South American teams performed strongly, with all five advancing to the round of 16 (four as group
                          winners), and four further advancing to the quarter-finals. However, only Uruguay advanced to the
                          semi-finals. Of the six African teams, only Ghana advanced to the round of 16. South Africa became
                          the first host nation in World Cup history to be eliminated in the first round, despite beating
                          France and drawing with Mexico, while Ghana and Ivory Coast were the only other African teams to
                          win a match. The overall performance of the African teams, in the first World Cup to be hosted on
                          the continent, was judged as disappointing by observers such as Cameroon great Roger Milla.[75]
                          Only six out of the thirteen UEFA teams advanced to the round of 16, a record low since the

                          to receive the honor, a sign of its profound influence on American comedy. He follows Billy

                          Lorne Michaels, who created the show, received the honor in 2004. “Adam Sandler has entertained

  - Source              :
                          The original conceptualization was an award which would celebrate one comedian, unlike the Kennedy
                          Center Honors which was more all-encompassing, and the venue would be the White House. They took
                          the idea to Ann Stock, then the White House social secretary. With the White House being an
                          inappropriate venue at the time, Kennedy Center was suggested. Bob Kaminsky, Peter Kaminsky and
                          Cappy McGarr were brought onboard and Comedy Central would coproduce and broadcast the show. At
                          this stage it was decided to name the prize after Mark Twain.[3] The inaugural recipient of the
                          award was Richard Pryor.[7] The first two years of the prize honoring Pryor and Jonathan Winters
                          were taped and broadcast on Comedy Central.[7] Since then, the award presentations have been taped
                          for broadcast on PBS.[8] In 2013 Carol Burnett was awarded, at age 80, while the youngest recipient
                          has been actress and comedian Tina Fey, at age 40 in 2010.[9][10][11] The Kennedy Center's intent
                          is to give the award to living persons, but one recipient, George Carlin, died in 2008 before
                          receiving his award. Carlin died five days after the official press release that he would be
                          awarded the prize.[12] Bill Cosby accepted his award at the Kennedy Center in 2009. He had twice
                          refused the honor, stating that he was disappointed with the profanity used in the inaugural
                          ceremony honoring Richard Pryor.

                          Water” collected $134 million in its North American box office debut, affirming the public’s
                          interest in Pandora and providing a needed boost to beleaguered movie theaters. Overseas, the
                          sci-fi epic brought in $301 million, bringing its global tally to a sizable $435 million. Those
                          ticket sales mark the third-biggest global opening weekend in pandemic times, following “Doctor
                          Strange in the Multiverse of Madness” ($442 million globally) and “Spider-Man: No Way Home” ($600
                          million globally). At the domestic box office, “Avatar 2” tied with “The Batman” to land the
                          fifth-biggest opening of the year. The follow-up film landed behind expectations, which pegged
                          initial numbers closer to $150 million to $175 million. Yet Cameron’s films, which have raked in
                          billions at the box office, often start slower and build over time. Disney, which holds the rights
                          to “Avatar” after acquiring 20th Century Fox in 2019, hopes that’s the case again; “The Way of
                          Water” cost at least $350 million to produce and many millions more to market. Cameron says the
                          film needs to become one of the top-grossing releases in history to break even and justify its
                          massive price tag.

                          Domestically, “Avatar: The Way of Water” was released in 4,202 theaters on over 12,000 screens, 400
                          of which were IMAX 3D. The studio and filmmakers bet big on the draw, and higher prices, of the 3D
                          format and premium large screens. By the end of Friday, “Avatar: The Way of Water” had already
                          earned $53 million in the U.S. and Canada and $180.1 million globally, aided by a China release —

                          blows “Avatar’s” $26.7 million first day in 2009 out of the water, though that didn’t include
                          Thursday previews. As with many ambitious Cameron projects, from “Titanic” to the first “Avatar,”
                          nerves were high for the costly sequel, one of the most expensive of all time, which began
                          production five years ago. It faced repeated delays and weathered The Walt Disney Co’s acquisition
                          of 21st Century Fox in 2019. It’s also one of four “Avatar” sequels Cameron had in mind. Filming on
                          the third movie, which shot simultaneously with “The Way of Water,” is done, with an expected
                          release in December 2024.

                          Square Enix has confirmed that the Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters, which are essentially upgraded
                          versions of Final Fantasy 1-6, will be released on Nintendo Switch and PS4 on April 19, 2023. The
                          Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters are currently available on PC and mobile, and soon a new audience
                          will be able to experience much of the history of the Final Fantasy franchise in a new way. If that
                          wasn't exciting enough, these versions come with a new pixel font, which seems to address one of
                          the biggest issues fans had with the games when they first were released - the questionable choice
                          of font by Square Enix for these remasters that left many unhappy. There will also be a new option
                          to switch between the original and new background music whenever you so choose, and there are more
                          options to adjust encounter rate, EXP, Gil, and ABP. All six games will be available on April 19 at
                          8am PT/11am ET/4pm BST, and fans will be able to purchase them individually or as a complete
                          package. On the eShop, the games range from $11.99-$17.99 per game, and all six can be purchased

                          Mexican filmmaker Guillermo del Toro's "Pinocchio" won the Academy Award for best animated feature
                          film on Sunday, the third Oscar of his career. The haunting stop-motion musical fantasy was
                          inspired by the 1883 Italian novel "The Adventures of Pinocchio" by Carlo Collodi, and informed by
                          Gris Grimly's illustrations of the 2002 edition of the book. Del Toro, 58, reimagines the classic
                          story of Pinocchio, a wooden puppet who dreams of being a real boy, who is cared for by carver
                          Geppetto. However, the story of the Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) film is set in Fascist Italy during the
                          interwar period and World War Two. "Pinocchio" prevailed over other popular nominees A24's

                          A new co-orbital asteroid for Earth? @AdrienCoffinet noticed that newly-discovered asteroid 2022 YG
                          has been circling Earth as a quasi asteroid since 1961 and will continue to do so until 2181. More
                          observations may refine this. pic.twitter.com/FJ5IkTotaV Visualizations of the orbital data for
                          2022 YG show it taking an odd path around our planet, stretching into an elongated ellipse in one
                          direction, then migrating back to a more circular orbit and stretching out again in the other
                          direction before the whole cycle repeats itself. Watching the asteroid's projected path over a
                          period of a few centuries is oddly hypnotic in this visualization posted to YouTube. Previous "mini
                          moons" included asteroids 2020 CD3 and 2006 RH120, but both only stayed for a relatively short
                          time. More observations are needed to refine the apparent orbit of 2022 YG to see if it truly will
                          be with us deep into the next century. There have been mini-moon false alarms in the recent past.
                          An apparent new tiny satellite spotted in 2020 turned out to be a big hunk of space junk from a
                          1960s rocket launch instead.

                          Happy New Year, Husky fans. We start off 2023 in the American southwest playing in a familiar
                          tournament: the Desert Hockey Classic. Our Huskies (12-6-3, 11-5-3 (1-1) Pairwise) will be
                          competing against the Arizona State Sun Devils (10-11-0, 9-8-0 (1-3) Pairwise), Boston University
                          (12-5-0, 9-4-0 (3-1) Pairwise), and the United States Air Force Academy (6-10-2, 6-10-2 (0-0)
                          Pairwise). This week due to time constraints on my end, I will only be going in depth on the
                          MTU-ASU game but will give a quick lightning rough on the BU-AF game and the possible match ups for
                          day two. FREE STREAM LINK:

                          two teams faced off was also the last time ASU managed to make a NCAA tournament bid. Since then,
                          the road for the Sun Devils has been rocky at best. This is their first season in their new hockey
                          arena aptly named “Mullet Arena”. While they may share it with the Arizona Coyotes for the next few
                          years, make no mistake, this is the Sun Devils arena first and the Coyotes second.

                          in our comprehensive guide. Microsoft 365 has benefitted multiple people worldwide. Tools like
                          Microsoft Word are go-to solutions for many businesses, and students also gain significant value.
                          But despite Microsoft 365’s many benefits, some have perceived it not always to be the most
                          affordable tool. Now, however, that is changing. The company is kicking off 2023 with a $2 per
                          month Basic plan, and here’s everything you need to know. Whether you’re considering purchasing
                          Microsoft 365 for the first plan or you want to downgrade an existing subscription, knowing what
                          you get with Basic is a good idea. In the subsections below, we’ll cover the most important areas
                          of consideration. If you frequently use Microsoft 365’s products, you’ll want to ensure that you
                          have enough space in the cloud. And with Microsoft 365 Basic, you get precisely that. After
                          purchasing a Microsoft 365 Basic subscription, you can store up to 100 GB in your OneDrive cloud.
                          This should be more than enough for your Word documents, PowerPoint presentations, and so on. The
                          100 GB of storage is on par with Google One, which costs the same amount per month. Of course, you
                          probably want a premium Microsoft subscription to access all of the most important tools. And when
                          you sign up for Microsoft 365 Basic, you will get precisely that.

Question 241              : What was the annual GDP growth rate of the U.S. economy in 2022?
Correct Answers         :  
                          2.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prediction (only positive):
  - Answer              :  2.1 percent
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          7 percent in the third quarter. GDP for 2022 Real GDP increased 2.1 percent in 2022 (from the 2021
                          annual level to the 2022 annual level), compared with an increase of 5.9 percent in 2021 (table 1).
                          The increase in real GDP in 2022 primarily reflected increases in consumer spending, exports,
                          private inventory investment, and nonresidential fixed investment that were partly offset by
                          decreases in residential fixed investment and federal government spending. Imports increased (table
                          2). The increase in consumer spending reflected an increase in services that was partly offset by a
                          decrease in goods. Within services, the increase was led by "other" services (mainly international
                          travel), food services and accommodations, and health care. The decrease in goods primarily
                          reflected decreases in food and beverages as well as motor vehicles and parts that were partly
                          offset by increases in recreational goods and vehicles and "other" nondurable goods (mainly
                          pharmaceuticals). The increase in exports reflected increases in both goods and services. The
                          increase in private inventory investment primarily reflected increases in manufacturing, wholesale
                          trade, and retail trade industries. The increase in nonresidential fixed investment reflected
                          increases in intellectual property products (led by software) and in equipment (led by information
                          processing equipment) that were partly offset by a decrease in structures (led by commercial and
                          health care as well as power and communication structures).

                          February 23, 2023. The increase in real GDP reflected increases in private inventory investment,
                          consumer spending, federal government spending, state and local government spending, and
                          nonresidential fixed investment that were partly offset by decreases in residential fixed
                          investment and exports. Imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, decreased
                          (table 2). The increase in private inventory investment was led by manufacturing (mainly petroleum
                          and coal products as well as chemicals) as well as mining, utilities, and construction industries
                          (led by utilities). The increase in consumer spending reflected increases in both services and
                          goods. Within services, the increase was led by health care, housing and utilities, and "other"
                          services (notably, personal care services). Within goods, the leading contributor was motor
                          vehicles and parts.

                          wrapped, a trailer debuted and a release date has been set. Here's everything to know about Shazam!
                          Fury of the Gods. Shazam! Fury of the Gods wouldn't be possible without the return of its titular
                          character played by Zachary Levi. Plus, his teenage counterpart Billy Batson, played by Asher
                          Angel, will also be making his return. Other cast members set to reprise their roles include Jack

                          in Steven Spielberg's West Side Story remake, is also cast as their sister in the film, playing the
                          role of Athena, one of three goddess daughters of the Titan Atlas — of which the actress said "was

                          Hercules, Atlas, Zeus, Achilles and Mercury, this muscled do-gooder in spandex was just a kid named
                          Billy Batson, played by Asher Angel. You remember Billy, a constant runaway from the Philadelphia
                          foster homes he's been forced to endure since his teen mom deserted him. Billy's foster bestie is
                          Freddy (the scene-stealing Jack Dylan Grazer), a kid on crutches with a smart mouth on him. Things
                          have changed for Billy and his orphaned buds -- Mary (Grace Caroline Currey), Eugene (Ian Chen),
                          Pedro (Jovan Armand) and Darla (a fab Faithe Herman) -- ever since the Wizard (Djimon Hounsou)
                          picked him as his successor. "Put your hands on my staff," demanded the Wiz. "Gross!" said Billy,
                          in a response that typified the script's "Deadpool"-lite irreverence. I'm pleased to report that
                          cheeky attitude still pops through in "Shazam! Fury of the Gods" as Billy/Shazam and his kid
                          besties, now in adult superhero bodies -- Adam Brody for Freddy, Meagan Good for Darla, Ross Butler

                          Qatar will become the first Middle Eastern hosts of the World Cup after Sepp Blatter, the Fifa
                          president, announced the 22 executive committee members had voted to award the 2022 tournament to a
                          country of only 1.7m people, beating off the rival bids from the United States, who had been
                          considered the favourites by many, Australia, South Korea and Japan. Qatar's bid had centred on an
                          appeal to Fifa to take "a bold gamble" by taking the World Cup to a region where football is
                          popular and is beginning to emerge as world player in global sport. The victory will be viewed as a
                          triumph for Mohammed Bin Hammam, the Fifa executive member, and president of the Asia Football
                          Confederation, who is the favourite to succeed Blatter. The US could point to its pedigree of
                          having already staged the 1994 World Cup, which drew vast crowds, plus commercial and financial
                          guarantees, and the opportunity for Fifa to make further inroads into a country where baseball,
                          basketball and the NFL still rule the sporting landscape. But despite concerns regarding the
                          blistering heat it was Qatar who convinced the Fifa voters. "We know it would be a bold gamble and
                          an exciting prospect but with no risk," the bid chief executive, Hassan Al-Thawadi, said. "Heat is
                          not and will not be an issue.

                          Front page layout Site theme Benj Edwards - Feb 6, 2023 5:10 pm UTC Since December 14, a Twitch
                          channel called Nothing, Forever has been streaming a live, endless AI-generated Seinfeld episode
                          that features pixelated cartoon versions of characters from the TV show. On Monday, Twitch gave the
                          channel a 14-day ban after language model tools from OpenAI went haywire and generated transphobic
                          content that violated community guidelines. Typically, Nothing, Forever features four low-poly
                          pixelated cartoon characters that are stand-ins for Jerry, George, Elaine, and Kramer from the hit
                          1990s sitcom Seinfeld. They sit around a New York apartment and talk about life, and sometimes the
                          topics of conversation unexpectedly get deep, such as in this viewer-captured segment where they
                          discussed the afterlife. Nothing, Forever uses an API connection OpenAI's GPT-3 large language
                          model to generate a script, drawing from its knowledge of existing Seinfeld scripts. Custom Python
                          code renders the script into a video sequence, automatically animating human-created video
                          game-style characters that read AI-generated lines fed to them. One of its creators provided more
                          technical details on how it works in a Reddit comment from December. As a new media experiment, the
                          faux-Seinfeld stream often feels awkward and unfunny, but it's still interesting because viewers
                          never know what the characters will talk about next.

                          transgender people are ruining the fabric of society. But no one is laughing, so I’m going to stop.

                          better-behaved) text-davinci-003 model led the creators to fall back to the lower-cost (and less
                          complex) text-curie-001 model to keep the show running. "The switch to Curie was what resulted in
                          the inappropriate text being generated," wrote an admin on the show's Discord channel. "We leverage
                          OpenAI’s content moderation tools, which have worked thus far for the Davinci model, but were not
                          successful with Curie.

                          Front page layout Site theme Benj Edwards - Feb 6, 2023 5:10 pm UTC Since December 14, a Twitch
                          channel called Nothing, Forever has been streaming a live, endless AI-generated Seinfeld episode
                          that features pixelated cartoon versions of characters from the TV show. On Monday, Twitch gave the
                          channel a 14-day ban after language model tools from OpenAI went haywire and generated transphobic
                          content that violated community guidelines. Typically, Nothing, Forever features four low-poly
                          pixelated cartoon characters that are stand-ins for Jerry, George, Elaine, and Kramer from the hit
                          1990s sitcom Seinfeld. They sit around a New York apartment and talk about life, and sometimes the
                          topics of conversation unexpectedly get deep, such as in this viewer-captured segment where they
                          discussed the afterlife. Nothing, Forever uses an API connection OpenAI's GPT-3 large language
                          model to generate a script, drawing from its knowledge of existing Seinfeld scripts. Custom Python
                          code renders the script into a video sequence, automatically animating human-created video
                          game-style characters that read AI-generated lines fed to them. One of its creators provided more
                          technical details on how it works in a Reddit comment from December. As a new media experiment, the
                          faux-Seinfeld stream often feels awkward and unfunny, but it's still interesting because viewers
                          never know what the characters will talk about next.

                          Advertisement Supported by The internet giant will grant users access to a chatbot after years of
                          cautious development, chasing splashy debuts from rivals OpenAI and Microsoft. By Nico Grant and
                          Cade Metz Nico Grant and Cade Metz reported this story in San Francisco. For more than three
                          months, Google executives have watched as projects at Microsoft and a San Francisco start-up called
                          OpenAI have stoked the public’s imagination with the potential for artificial intelligence. But on
                          Tuesday, Google tentatively stepped off the sidelines as it released a chatbot called Bard. The new
                          A.I. chatbot will be available to a limited number of users in the United States and Britain and
                          will accommodate additional users, countries and languages over time, Google executives said in an
                          interview. The cautious rollout is the company’s first public effort to address the recent chatbot
                          craze driven by OpenAI and Microsoft, and it is meant to demonstrate that Google is capable of
                          providing similar technology. But Google is taking a much more circumspect approach than its
                          competitors, which have faced criticism that they are proliferating an unpredictable and sometimes
                          untrustworthy technology. Still, the release represents a significant step to stave off a threat to
                          Google’s most lucrative business, its search engine. Many in the tech industry believe that Google
                          — more than any other big tech company — has a lot to lose and to gain from A.I.

                          Advertisement Supported by The internet giant will grant users access to a chatbot after years of
                          cautious development, chasing splashy debuts from rivals OpenAI and Microsoft. By Nico Grant and
                          Cade Metz Nico Grant and Cade Metz reported this story in San Francisco. For more than three
                          months, Google executives have watched as projects at Microsoft and a San Francisco start-up called
                          OpenAI have stoked the public’s imagination with the potential for artificial intelligence. But on
                          Tuesday, Google tentatively stepped off the sidelines as it released a chatbot called Bard. The new
                          A.I. chatbot will be available to a limited number of users in the United States and Britain and
                          will accommodate additional users, countries and languages over time, Google executives said in an
                          interview. The cautious rollout is the company’s first public effort to address the recent chatbot
                          craze driven by OpenAI and Microsoft, and it is meant to demonstrate that Google is capable of
                          providing similar technology. But Google is taking a much more circumspect approach than its
                          competitors, which have faced criticism that they are proliferating an unpredictable and sometimes
                          untrustworthy technology. Still, the release represents a significant step to stave off a threat to
                          Google’s most lucrative business, its search engine. Many in the tech industry believe that Google
                          — more than any other big tech company — has a lot to lose and to gain from A.I.

Question 250              : who founded midjourney?

                          As the technology goes mainstream, though, one company will be able to take some credit for its
                          ascendancy: a 10-person research lab named Midjourney, which makes an eponymous AI image generator
                          accessed through a Discord chat server. Although the name might be unfamiliar, you’ve probably seen
                          the output from Midjourney’s system floating about your social media feeds already. To generate
                          your own, you just join Midjourney’s Discord, type a prompt, and the system makes an image for you.
                          Midjourney exists on Discord because “people want to make things together” “A lot of people ask us,
                          why don’t you just make an iOS app that makes you a picture?” Midjourney’s founder, David Holz,
                          told The Verge in an interview. “But people want to make things together, and if you do that on
                          iOS, you have to make your own social network. And that’s pretty hard. So if you want your own
                          social experience, Discord is really great.” Sign up for a free account, and you get 25 credits,
                          with all images generated in public chatrooms. After that, you’ll have to pay — either $10 or $30 a
                          month, depending on the number of images you want to make and whether or not they’re private to
                          you. This week, though, Midjourney is expanding access to its model, allowing anyone to create
                          their own Discord server with their own AI image generator.

                          “Coming from the IA [intelligence augmentation] school of thought, I’ve always been more interested
                          in empowering people and trying to make people better.” Like many experts in AI who believe in
                          using machines to perform tasks that humans would consider intelligent or smart —and experts in IA,
                          who place humans at the center of the system and use technology to support and complement human
                          cognitive functions, Holz chose a path that would let him enjoy the best of both worlds. “Over the
                          years, I’ve realized that we can use AI to empower people and to make people better and those
                          people can make better AI — it’s like coming full circle and everyone wins,” he said. Leap Motion
                          transpired out of this ideology. The company developed an optical hand tracking module that
                          captures the movements of human hands using AI. “The goal wasn’t to replace a sign language person,
                          but it was to allow us to literally be embodied in virtual spaces inside of computers. And now,
                          with Midjourney, we are not trying to replace an artist but are giving them tools to explore new
                          mediums of thought and expand their imaginative powers,” Holz explained. In 2021, Holz started
                          Midjourney as an independent research lab. Around the same time, industry buzzwords like ‘diffusion
                          models’ and ‘contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP)’ were on everyone’s lips. Building on
                          these developments, the lab began offering its text-to-image service in 2022.

                          will let me focus on what I love: meeting Pinners, nurturing new products, and advising on
                          long-term strategy. My new role reminds me a bit of what I did in the early days. When we started
                          Pinterest, it was more art project than business. I knew most Pinners by their first name. We
                          obsessed over every pixel, feature, and word in our product. I posted my cell phone number on our

                          However, the Japanese gaming company tends not to share that information for each individual
                          release; although there is information on its support page regarding the time most first-party
                          Switch games should release. According to the support page, "Digital software that is also sold
                          physically will usually be available at 9:00 p.m. PT the night before the physical game's release

                          This fourth entry has been a long time coming, with Shigeru Miyamoto saying back in 2015 that it
                          was “very close to completion.” Seven years later, it’s finally set to release in July. This
                          installment introduces a new Ice Pikmin that can freeze enemies and the environment to help your
                          alien flora navigate the strange planet they find themselves on. The plants aren’t alone this time
                          around, either, as they get help from a rotund dog called Oatchi, who can smash through barriers
                          and carry Pikmin on its back while swimming across ponds and puddles. Overall, it looks like good
                          fun for fans of the series or anyone interested in picking up a colorful, cartoonish strategy game.

                          However, the Japanese gaming company tends not to share that information for each individual
                          release; although there is information on its support page regarding the time most first-party
                          Switch games should release. According to the support page, "Digital software that is also sold
                          physically will usually be available at 9:00 p.m. PT the night before the physical game's release
                          date." This gives us the confirmation that Pikmin 4 will more than likely be available to start
                          playing the night before launch, at least in the United States. Fans on the west coast will be able

                          layoffs are done? SCHECHNER: Well, those are good questions. We know the numerator. We don't
                          necessarily know the denominator. At the end of the year, Meta had roughly 86,000 employees. Most
                          of those who are being laid off - the 11,000 from last fall - were still on the payroll, the
                          company said.

Question 255              : What company acquired iRobot?

                          A slew of home-cleaning robots adds to the company's tech arsenal, making it more involved in
                          consumer's lives beyond static things like voice control. Amazon's Astro robot, which helps with
                          tasks like setting an alarm, was unveiled last year at an introductory price of $1,000. But its
                          rollout has been limited and has received a lackluster response. The company hasn't had much
                          success with household robots, but the iRobot acquisition and the company's strong market
                          reputation provide a "massive foothold in the consumer robot market" that could help Amazon
                          replicate the success of its Echo line of smart speakers, said Lian Jye Su, a robotics industry
                          analyst for ABI Research. Su said it also illustrates the shortcomings of consumer robotics vendors
                          like iRobot, which struggled to expand beyond a niche product and was in a "race-to-the-bottom"
                          competition with Korean and Chinese manufacturers offering cheaper versions of a robotic vacuum. On
                          Friday, iRobot reported its quarterly results. Revenue plunged 30% primarily on order reductions
                          and delays, and the company announced it was laying off 10% of its workforce. Amazon said it will
                          acquire iRobot for $61 per share in an all-cash transaction that will include iRobot's net debt.
                          The company has total current debt of approximately $332.1 million as of July 2. The deal is
                          subject to approval by shareholders and regulators. Upon completion, iRobot's CEO, Colin Angle,
                          will remain in his position.

Question 256              : Which team won Super Bowl LVII?

  - Source              :
                          Super Bowl LVII was an American football game played to determine the champion of the National
                          Football League (NFL) for the 2022 season. The American Football Conference (AFC) champion Kansas
                          City Chiefs defeated the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Philadelphia Eagles, 38–35.
                          The game was played on February 12, 2023, at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. It was the
                          fourth Super Bowl hosted by the Phoenix metropolitan area, and the third at this venue, with the
                          most recent previously being Super Bowl XLIX in 2015 (then known as University of Phoenix
                          Stadium).[6] Both teams finished the regular season with a league-best 14–3 record. This was the
                          Eagles fourth Super Bowl appearance overall and the second in the last six seasons, having
                          previously won Super Bowl LII; the Eagles previously lost Super Bowls XV and XXXIX. This was the
                          Chiefs' fifth Super Bowl appearance overall and third in the last four seasons, having previously
                          won Super Bowls IV and LIV, and losses in Super Bowls I and LV. After the Eagles went into halftime
                          up 24–14, the Chiefs mounted a comeback to win the game 38–35 with a game-winning field goal kicked
                          by Harrison Butker. Butker's game winning kick was set up by a pivotal and controversial defensive
                          holding call on Philadelphia cornerback James Bradberry, which was criticized by some observers but
                          supported by others.

Question 258              : who trained LLaMA?

                          LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI) is a family of large language models (LLMs), released by Meta
                          AI starting in February 2023. For the first version of LLaMa, four model sizes were trained: 7, 13,
                          33 and 65 billion parameters. LLaMA's developers reported that the 13B parameter model's
                          performance on most NLP benchmarks exceeded that of the much larger GPT-3 (with 175B parameters)
                          and that the largest model was competitive with state of the art models such as PaLM and
                          Chinchilla.[1] Whereas the most powerful LLMs have generally been accessible only through limited
                          APIs (if at all), Meta released LLaMA's model weights to the research community under a
                          noncommercial license.[2] Within a week of LLaMA's release, its weights were leaked to the public
                          on 4chan via BitTorrent.[3] In July 2023, Meta released several models as Llama 2, using 7, 13 and
                          70 billion parameters. On July 18, 2023, in partnership with Microsoft, Meta announced Llama 2, the
                          next generation of LLaMA. Meta trained and released Llama 2 in three model sizes: 7, 13, and 70
                          billion parameters.

                          Advancing health one insight at a time n a trip to Capitol Reef National Park with my son, I wanted
                          to try something different, something exciting, something I’d never done before. So we went on a
                          two-hour llama hike. When Andrew, the guide, arrived with the 350-pound animals, the first thing I
                          thought was how we were supposed to trust these animals not to trample us. But Andrew explained how
                          to walk the llamas and we began our hike. Right away, I noticed that my son’s llama was more
                          responsive and much calmer than mine. My llama was less experienced. He was making sounds and being
                          obnoxious. He wasn't responding to me. Andrew took over and taught me to be a little more forceful.
                          He told me to adjust to my llama’s personality. As we continued to walk, my son’s llama suddenly
                          became distraught and began making a scary sound. The llama was trying to warn us that there were
                          cows around. But even though the llama was worried, at no point was my son in danger. No matter how
                          upset the llama was, he was following my nine-year-old, who was so much smaller than the llama. And
                          that’s when I began to wonder, how do you train these big animals to be so reliable? How does
                          everyone—according to the llama outfitter’s Google reviews—have such a great experience?

                          Given my background as a senior value engineer, I made the obvious leap: Could what they do to
                          train these llamas help us provide a better, more reliable patient experience? After we got home, I
                          called the owner of Wilderness Ridge Llamas to learn how the llamas were trained. The boss told me:
                          If you can’t do it right, don’t do it at all. If you can’t spend all the time training, it won’t be
                          worth it. These were the key principles they used to train the llamas. And while humans may be a
                          long way from llamas in the phylogenetic tree, the principles might work for us, too. Whether
                          llamas or people, you get a reliable experience by training right: Apply these principles to your
                          learners: Every person—and every llama—is different. My llama needed a firmer hand than my son’s.
                          When they train the llamas, they take that into account. They train baby llamas differently than
                          older llamas. They provide a different level of attention and set lower expectations. We can apply
                          that to people, too. Not everyone has the same knowledge or the same skill set. That’s why I like
                          to find out who’s going to be in a class I am teaching. We need to understand people’s backgrounds
                          and where they are coming from so we can present material in the appropriate way. Is the audience
                          medical students or physicians?

                          works. The YouTube TV channels package is very simple — there's a single base plan, with more than
                          85 channels. Given how expensive live TV streaming services are compared to their standard
                          video-on-demand counterparts, it's definitely worth looking into what each service offers, and here
                          you'll find out everything you need to know about YouTube TV. Not to be confused with video-sharing

                          but without that kind of subscription. YouTube TV offers plenty of cable channels, versatile
                          expansions and a clean UI but at a reasonable price, making it a favorite among live TV streaming
                          fans. So, if you're considering YouTube TV as your streaming solution of choice, it's most
                          definitely worth a look. Peruse the many subscription packages YouTube TV offers. It won't take
                          long. There is just one base price plan for YouTube TV. That's it. And that's a good thing. Here's

                          The new YouTube TV price is just for new subscribers, with existing subscribers seeing the price
                          increase from $64.99 per month starting April 18. As with most streaming services, YouTube TV
                          doesn't have a contract, so you can pause or cancel at any point without penalty. While it doesn't
                          have as many channels as some of the other services (mainly Sling TV, which has more options, and
                          DirecTV Stream, which has a slew of more expensive plans), it's good value, with local TV channels
                          available via streaming and free, unlimited cloud-based DVR (record as much as you want and watch
                          at your leisure). YouTube TV also has continued to add new add-on options. HBO Max is available, as
                          is Showtime. There's also a Sports Plus bundle with NFL RedZone, Fox Soccer Plus and more. And it
                          also has most of the major Paramount Network channels, including Comedy Central, MTV and BET. One
                          of the few streaming services in the United States to still offer one, YouTube TV has a free trial
                          period that lets you test the service before you pay. The YouTube TV Base Plan usually has a
                          seven-day free trial period, which should be more than enough time to make sure that it's something
                          you want to pay for. But the lengths of trial periods can vary. Free trials for add-on networks
                          have separate sign-up and billing.

Question 265              : Who won The Voice Season 23?
Correct Answers         :  
                          Gina Miles

  - Source              :
                          The twenty-third season of the American reality television series The Voice premiered on March 6,
                          2023, on NBC.[1][2] The season is presented by Carson Daly, who returned for his twenty-third
                          season as host. The panel of coaches for the season consists of Blake Shelton, who returned for his
                          twenty-third and final season as a coach; returning coach Kelly Clarkson, who returned for her
                          ninth season after a one-season hiatus; and debuting coaches Chance the Rapper and Niall Horan.[3]
                          Gina Miles was named as the winner of the season, with the closest margin to-date, on the season
                          finale that aired on May 23, 2023. Her victory marks Niall Horan's first win as a coach, with Horan
                          becoming the third new coach, after Clarkson and John Legend, to win on his debut season, as well
                          as the youngest coach to win a season. On October 11, 2022, NBC announced that the show would be
                          returning for a twenty-third season to be aired in spring 2023.[4][5] Previously, it was announced
                          that, beginning with the 2021–22 United States network television schedule, only one season would
                          be produced per cyclical year,[6] though it was reported that this decision was reversed upon the
                          announcement of the season.[7] Later, it was announced that the season would air on March 6.

                          On Monday night, ahead of the finale, Miles told PEOPLE she wanted to make the best of her
                          experience during the last show. “I’m going to live it up no matter what happens because to me it’s
                          not about winning it’s just about the experience as it’s come along,” she said at the time. “For
                          me, I never thought I would make it this far but I did.” She added. “I want to be living my best
                          life.” To celebrate Blake Shelton's final season, several familiar faces returned to the show,
                          including Camila Cabello, Jennifer Hudson, Nick Jonas, John Legend and Adam Levine, who all
                          previously coached alongside Shelton on The Voice. More special appearances by past coaches
                          included Gwen Stefani, Usher, Pharrell Williams and Dolly Parton, who was previously a mentor. The
                          Voice's season 23 finale aired live on Tuesday at 9 p.m. EST on NBC.

                          and disruption. The pandemic proved a boon for the toy industry writ large, as sports, school and
                          other in-person activities were put on hold. Last year brought a boom in consumer demand, as well
                          as massive, global supply chain headaches. For the third quarter, Hasbro said $100 million worth of
                          orders went unfilled during the period and recorded a 7% drop in operating income in its consumer
                          products segment, due mainly to shipping constraints and shipping costs. Even with that pain,
                          though, the company's revenue overall rose 11%, and operating profits were up 9%, thanks to gains
                          elsewhere in the business including its entertainment segment.

                          29][30][31] In October 2011, Emilio Romano was appointed as president of Telemundo, a role he would
                          handle until his abrupt resignation from the network in October 2013.[32] On May 14, 2012,
                          Telemundo announced that it would launch a new branding campaign that would include the debut of a
                          new slogan and on-air identity, including the replacement of its framed "T" logo (a variant of the
                          1992-era design that had been introduced by the network in 1999), with a new logo featuring two
                          partial red spheres forming the "T", described to "capture the duality of Telemundo's audience,
                          balancing the strong connection to their Latin roots with their contemporary mindset of living in
                          the U.S." The new logo and graphics package debuted on-air on December 8 of that year.[33]
                          Telemundo achieved ratings success during 2012, with the telenovela series Rosa Diamante ("Diamond
                          Rose"; a remake of Enrique Torres' Perla Negra) and the Caracol TV-produced Pablo Escobar. That
                          year, Telemundo debuted the "social novela" Secreteando [es] on Facebook, with comments made on
                          other social media websites.[34]

  - Source              :
                          By Jay Peters and Emma Roth Elon Musk has created a new company dedicated to artificial
                          intelligence — and it’s called X.AI, as first reported by The Wall Street Journal. The company,
                          which a Nevada filing indicates was incorporated last month, currently has Musk as its director and
                          Jared Birchall, the director of Musk’s family office, listed as its secretary. The filing, which
                          The Verge has also obtained, indicates that Musk incorporated the business on March 9th, 2023.
                          Rumors about Musk starting up an AI company have been floating around for days, with a report from
                          Business Insider revealing that Musk had purchased thousands of graphic processing units (GPUs) to
                          power an upcoming generative AI product. The Financial Times similarly reported that Musk planned
                          to create an AI firm to compete with the Microsoft-backed OpenAI. Musk even reportedly sought
                          funding from SpaceX and Tesla investors to get the company started. During an interview on Twitter
                          Spaces, when Musk was asked about all the GPUs he purchased, the billionaire made no mention of his
                          plans to build an AI company, stating “it seems like everyone and their dog is buying GPUs at this
                          point.” The purported X.AI name matches the branding of the X Corp. name he has since assigned to
                          Twitter, along with the “X” label he’s applied to his vision of an “everything app.

                          was dissolved as a company this week and was replaced by a new company Musk calls X. The move is
                          seen as an attempt to build a social media platform that also allows payments, turning it into “the
                          everything app,” akin to how apps like WeChat work in China. Twitter announced this week it was
                          partnering with eToro to allow users to be able to trade stocks and crypto. It should be pretty
                          clear by now that Musk’s call for a six-month pause was purely out of self interest in the AI arms
                          race, as I wrote at the time. ChatGPT has become a fascinating tool for people who want to
                          experiment with large language models (LLMs) that answer questions posed in natural language. But
                          there are still a lot of kinks to be worked out, as ChatGPT will often give confident answers, even
                          when it’s wrong. AI is largely a magic trick at this point, sometimes spouting nonsense that users
                          may not know enough about to fact-check. But it’s an interesting magic trick and it’s something
                          that will improved upon as more people in the world of tech become involved. Musk must know he’s
                          behind in the most exciting development on the web since social media went mainstream in the late
                          2000s. But the billionaire clearly doesn’t intend to stay behind for long.

                          9 yards per carry for the Maroon squad, running through some decent holes produced by most of the
                          first-team offensive line. “To me, that’s the one area that we had to improve in,” Pry said. “We
                          have to be able to run the football. It really helps everything else. With our offense, with our
                          defense. If we can run the ball, that to me is 100-level foundational stuff. And we’re getting
                          better there. “I think we’ve got a pretty good group up front on defense. We’ve got some old heads
                          at d-tackle that have got some weight on them, can press gaps and do things, and we were still able
                          to get some movement on them guys. So it’s a work in progress, but again, I think the O-line’s
                          improved, I think the running backs are better. I like what’s happening in that room. Still got a
                          ways to go.” Nice write up on the game and the team. Enjoyed it. thanks Mid-May should be
                          interesting to see who hits the portal. kinda smh as to why qb’s didn’t get a chance to run with
                          1’s/maroon at least for a series… kinda disservice to drones for sure Soooo….I didn’t get to watch
                          the game. Did Grant Wells really have 3 kickoffs? 😲 Those duplicate numbers mess up the stat guys

                          Spring Game. The spectacle filled Lane Stadium to half capacity and was televised by the ACC

                          White, with a final score of 34-0. Here are five takeaways from the action we saw on the field on
                          Saturday: 1. Quarterback Competition is far from over as Wells and Drones continue to battle it out
                          There was never going to be a definitive answer exiting the Spring Game, but we all got the chance
                          to see the development of Grant Wells and the capabilities of Kyron Drones at the quarterback
                          position. Wells finished 12-of-18 for 148 passing yards (66.7%) and a TD. He had 3 rushes for 10
                          yards and a rushing touchdown. Notably, Wells threw 6 passes that were gains of 16-or-more yards.
                          The incumbent starter mostly linked up with the Gosnell brothers (Stephen and Benji) and Tucker
                          Holloway. Wells executed his plays and limited the risky elements of his playstyle. It also helps
                          that he inherited the more stable offensive line, which once again benefited his performance.

                          (Washington, DC) – Today, Mayor Muriel Bowser announced that District of Columbia’s 2023 Teacher of
                          the Year, Jermar “Coach” Rountree, has been selected as one of five finalists for the 2023 National
                          Teacher of the Year. Coach Roundtree is a pre-K to eighth grade health and physical education
                          teacher at Center City Public Charter School’s Brightwood campus. Coach Rountree is the third DC
                          Teacher of the Year to be in the running for the national honor since 2005. “Jermar Rountree is an
                          outstanding educator, a leader in his school and community, a role model for teachers across the
                          District, and a vital source of support and inspiration for the students and families he serves,”
                          said Mayor Bowser. “For his students, Coach Rountree is so much more than a teacher – he is a
                          problem solver, a trusted confidant, and a mentor. DC is proud to have him representing our city’s
                          incredible educators on the national stage.” An educator with 16 years of experience, Coach
                          Rountree takes a holistic approach to his work with the children and the school community he serves
                          at Center City PCS-Brightwood Campus. In addition to his work at Center City PCS’s Brightwood
                          Campus, Coach Rountree serves as the District Teacher Lead for the Physical Education and Health
                          Department.

                          As the 2023 National Teacher of the Year, Peterson will spend a year representing educators and
                          serving as an ambassador for students and teachers across the nation. She plans to spend her year
                          elevating teachers’ stories of the good happening in the classroom, in hope of both encouraging
                          current teachers and attracting new educators to the profession. She believes that when we take the
                          time to learn each other’s stories, we are more open to searching for the places where our values
                          intersect. “Everyone has a powerful story to share – listening to the stories of my students, and
                          those of my fellow educators across Oklahoma, has helped me grow personally and professionally,”
                          Peterson said. “I believe that listening to one story after another has an exponential positive
                          impact. It is an honor to be able to share the stories of our country’s brilliant students and
                          dedicated educators as the next National Teacher of the Year.” CCSSO’s National Teacher of the Year
                          Program identifies exceptional teachers across the country, recognizes their effective work in the
                          classroom, engages them in a year of professional learning and amplifies their voices. “Despite the
                          challenges of the past few years, joyful, innovative learning is taking place in classrooms across
                          the country every day. I look forward to the new ways Rebecka will help shine a light on the
                          stories of good things happening in our schools,” said CCSSO Chief Executive Officer Carissa Moffat
                          Miller.

                          production there. By Alex Travelli and Suhasini Raj Reporting from New Delhi Tim Cook, the chief
                          executive of Apple, visited India this week to open the company’s first two Apple stores there: The
                          biggest public company in the world is finally opening its first retail outlets in the world’s most
                          populous country. Roaring crowds of would-be customers greeted him in Mumbai on Tuesday at a sleek
                          glass-and-timber flatiron of a storefront, called Apple BKC, in the Bandra Kurla Complex. On

                          the capital’s biggest mall. The Apple brand is not new to India. But for the past 25 years — marked
                          this week, in fact — Apple has relied solely on third-party sellers to get its products into the
                          hands of Indian consumers. The iPhone is still a rare sight within the ocean of cheaper, and mostly
                          Chinese-branded, Android smartphones that have swept across India over the past decade. Yet in
                          India, as in nearly every other part of the world, Apple has its fans. Some of the most ardent were
                          at the Mumbai opening, screaming their support.

                          incomes several times higher than India’s. In a potential market so big, Apple does not need to
                          make much of a dent to earn back its investment. The company’s market share in India has been
                          growing rapidly.

                          Sundar Pichai received $226 million in total compensation in 2022, most of which came through stock
                          awards, according to a securities report filed by the company on Friday. Pichai was awarded $218
                          million in equities last year through a triennial stock grant. His annual salary was $2 million
                          from 2020 to 2022, the filing stated. The CEO's compensation package also included almost $6
                          million for personal security in 2022. Other Alphabet and Google principal executives made
                          approximately $22 million to $35 million in annual stock awards, according to the filing. The
                          report comes as Alphabet is initiating cost restructuring measures, including layoffs in January
                          that eliminated 12,000 workers, or 6% of its workforce.

                          LOS ANGELES — Coyne Lloyd, a 35-year-old tech investor, was visiting his family in Upstate New York
                          recently when he decided to set up some dates in the city. He fired up Hinge, his preferred dating
                          app, and swiped on a few interesting women. After receiving a couple of matches, he turned, out of
                          curiosity, to a new AI dating tool called Rizz to break the ice. “There’s some amount of mental
                          work and barrier to thinking of how to compose a message [on a dating app],” Lloyd said. “It’s like
                          getting started on a term paper.” Rizz, which is meant to function as a digital wingman, helps
                          users come up with killer opening lines and responses to potential matches. The company behind it
                          is just one of many start-ups trying to transform romance through artificial intelligence by
                          optimizing and automating online dating, now one of the primary ways by which people find romantic
                          connections. Using dating apps can be a slog. Some people complain that they have to sift through
                          countless matches as others indiscriminately swipe; it is difficult to start conversations with
                          strangers; and many users end up viewing the apps more as a necessary chore than an exciting
                          opportunity to connect with someone new. Additionally, the world is becoming more automated: Email
                          messages auto-complete, subscription services auto-renew, and any product under the sun is a single

                          Mirakyan's interest in an app like his, however, seems to go deeper than Lloyd's term paper
                          comparison. Speaking to WaPo, he explained that he's always had a difficult time reading social
                          cues — a dating stressor that a tool like YourMove.ai helps to alleviate. "There's such a gap
                          currently," he told the newspaper, "in what people like myself want to communicate and how it comes
                          across." That's sympathetic, in a sense, and we could see how AI assistance might benefit folks who
                          have a tough time socially. At the same time, however, balance is definitely still needed here.
                          Romance is one of the most human things out there, and the digital dating world is robotic enough
                          as it is. Do we really want everyone on the apps just passing AI-generated quips and complements
                          back and forth for eternity? That's starting to sound like The Sims — and as humans, maybe we
                          should shoot a little higher. More on post-AI online dating: Man "Sure" His AI Girlfriend Will save

                          LOS ANGELES — Coyne Lloyd, a 35-year-old tech investor, was visiting his family in Upstate New York
                          recently when he decided to set up some dates in the city. He fired up Hinge, his preferred dating
                          app, and swiped on a few interesting women. After receiving a couple of matches, he turned, out of
                          curiosity, to a new AI dating tool called Rizz to break the ice. “There’s some amount of mental
                          work and barrier to thinking of how to compose a message [on a dating app],” Lloyd said. “It’s like
                          getting started on a term paper.” Rizz, which is meant to function as a digital wingman, helps
                          users come up with killer opening lines and responses to potential matches. The company behind it
                          is just one of many start-ups trying to transform romance through artificial intelligence by
                          optimizing and automating online dating, now one of the primary ways by which people find romantic
                          connections. Using dating apps can be a slog. Some people complain that they have to sift through
                          countless matches as others indiscriminately swipe; it is difficult to start conversations with
                          strangers; and many users end up viewing the apps more as a necessary chore than an exciting
                          opportunity to connect with someone new. Additionally, the world is becoming more automated: Email
                          messages auto-complete, subscription services auto-renew, and any product under the sun is a single

                          CHICAGO (April 25, 2023) – The U.S. Soccer Federation has appointed Matt Crocker as the next
                          Sporting Director. The former English Football Association Head of Development Teams and
                          Southampton Director of Football Operations brings more than 25 years of experience in player
                          development and coaching with proven success at the club, youth, and senior international levels.
                          As Sporting Director, Crocker will oversee U.S. Soccer’s entire Sporting Department, focusing on
                          the Men’s and Women’s National Team programs, Youth National Teams, and the Extended National
                          Teams. Crocker will be responsible for setting U.S. Soccer’s sporting vision, overseeing the
                          performance of all national teams, implementing the technical development plan, developing sporting
                          culture, philosophy, ensuring greater communication, and sharing of best practices. While he will
                          start fulltime on August 2nd, Crocker will immediately begin the process of hiring the head coach
                          of the Men’s National Team and supporting the U.S. Women’s National Team general manager Kate
                          Markgraf and USWNT head coach Vlatko Andonovski. He will officially start during the 2023 FIFA
                          Women’s World Cup. “During the interview process, we identified several key characteristics and
                          experiences that set Matt apart,” said U.S. Soccer President Cindy Parlow Cone. “He is an
                          experienced leader and has had success at the professional and National Team level. He is a great

                          U.S. Soccer plans to narrow the focus of its sporting director job as part of a slight but
                          significant restructuring near the top of the federation. The role has been vacant since Earnie
                          Stewart departed last month. In 2019, it was essentially created for Stewart, who extended his
                          responsibilities beyond the U.S. men's national team, to all of U.S. Soccer's national teams and
                          even to the sport's broader American ecosystem. But now, as U.S. Soccer's leaders conduct what they
                          are calling "a global search" for Stewart's successor, they have also changed the job description.
                          President Cindy Parlow Cone said Saturday that the new sporting director, whom they expect to hire
                          before July's Women's World Cup, will "really focus on our national teams ... and our technical
                          plan at the elite level." They have essentially split Stewart's job — which "was huge," Parlow Cone
                          said — into two. They will create a new position to oversee the broader landscape. That new
                          executive, who will report to CEO JT Batson, will focus on everything from coaching education to
                          referee development, and on "growing youth and adult participation," Batson said. This will, in
                          turn, allow the sporting director to work almost exclusively on the elite player pathway and the
                          environments and structures surrounding U.S. Soccer's 27 national teams — from the USMNT and USWNT

                          Even as Lena and Salim’s courtship appears headed to the altar, Salim is still creepily tied to the
                          apron strings of his mysterious mother, Raheela (Nimra Bucha). It’s a good thing Ria has the loyal,
                          all-in support of her besties Alba (Ella Bruccoleri) and Clara (Seraphina Beh), who have her back
                          no matter how crazy things get. As the story unfolds, audiences are treated to extravagant fight
                          scenes, tight action sequences, and a showstopping Bollywood dance number, all filtered through the
                          experience of one girl coming of age. As such, the script doesn’t shy away from female rage and
                          issues around identity, making the film a unique delight for viewers who’ve rarely seen themselves
                          reflected onscreen. Manzoor discussed Polite Society with The Credits, pointing to her influences
                          and revealing how her collaborations were integral to making this unusual genre-bending film
                          successful on so many levels. Polite Society is a love note to your favorite genre movies growing
                          up. Some films mentioned as inspiration are Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, The Matrix, and the

                          Fold, known internally by the codename "Felix," will have the "most durable hinge on a foldable"
                          phone, according to the documents. It will cost upward of $1,700 and compete with Samsung's $1,799
                          Galaxy Z Fold 4. Google plans to market the Pixel Fold as water-resistant and pocket-sized, with an
                          outside screen that measures 5.8 inches across, according to the documents.

                          Obsidian and Porcelain. You can also choose between three official Pixel Fold cases that come in
                          Hazel, Porcelain, and Bay colors (pictured above). Google is charging a similar price to the rival
                          Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4. The 256GB variant of the Pixel Fold will cost you a whopping $1,799. The
                          512GB version is even more expensive at $1,919, which seems costly for Google’s first attempt at a

                          availability, Google is not casting a very wide net for the Pixel Fold. The handset will only sell
                          in the US, UK, Germany, and Japan, at least to start with.

                          Apart from its folding design, Google’s pricey new phone also mostly sticks to familiar territory —
                          we haven’t seen much so far that sets it apart from other Pixels and other foldables. Google may
                          well develop more standout tricks for the Fold down the road — we know the company is working on an
                          “interpreter mode” for Google Translate that uses both screens for in-person translations — but it
                          feels like a lot of the same in a new package for now. What it is: a new, midrange smartphone How
                          much does it cost? $499 What does it promise? Google’s most thoughtful software features, on a
                          budget. With the Pixel 7a, Google mostly stuck to its usual playbook: it took last year’s Pixel 7,
                          kept most of its important guts, made its shell out of cheaper materials, and planned to sell it
                          for less. This time, Google made one surprising change to the formula: it stuck a higher-resolution
                          main camera sensor in the back, so expect slightly more detailed photos. Apart from that, though,
                          this is Google’s attempt at making some of its hallmark Pixel features, like Magic Eraser for
                          photos, smart call screening, and a tool for quickly navigating customer service phone trees
                          available to a wider audience. That may all sound a bit basic, and perhaps it is. But after living
                          with the device for about a week, I never really felt like I was missing out on anything more
                          expensive devices offered.

                          unemployment rate fell. Monthly change in jobs +500,000 jobs +253,000 in April +400,000 +300,000

                          Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics By Ella Koeze Lydia DePillis Employers added 253,000 jobs in
                          April, the Labor Department reported Friday, in a reversal of the cooling trend that had marked the
                          first quarter and was expected to continue. The unemployment rate was 3.4 percent, down from 3.5
                          percent in March, and matched the level in January, which was the lowest since 1969. The
                          higher-than-forecast job gain complicates the Federal Reserve’s potential shift toward a pause in
                          interest rate increases. Chair Jerome H. Powell said on Wednesday that the central bank might
                          continue to raise rates if new data showed the economy wasn’t slowing enough to keep prices down.

                          market remains red hot. That's great for workers, but it's bound to reinforce concerns about high
                          inflation. Hiring surged last month as U.S. employers added 339,000 jobs, far above expectations,
                          according to a report from the Labor Department on Friday. The job gains for March and April were
                          also stronger than previously reported. The April jobs figure was revised up by 41,000, while the
                          March number was revised up by 52,000. The strong jobs numbers indicate the U.S. jobs engine
                          continues to chug along, with substantial hiring in business services, health care and hospitality.
                          Construction companies added 25,000 jobs last month even as high interest rates have weighed on the
                          housing market. The unemployment rate, which is compiled from a separate survey, paints a less rosy
                          picture. Unemployment, which been at a half century low, inched up in May to 3.7%.

                          vaccination are set to end on October 1, 2024. These rules allowed, for example, pharmacy interns,

                          give COVID-19 vaccines. There is ongoing deliberation at the federal level and in the courts in

                          According to Alan Cooper, the "Father of Visual Basic", the concept of Clippit was based on a
                          "tragic misunderstanding" of research conducted at Stanford University, showing that the same part
                          of the brain in use while using a mouse or keyboard was also responsible for emotional reactions
                          while interacting with other human beings and thus is the reason people yell at their computer
                          monitors.[11] Microsoft concluded that if humans reacted to computers the same way they react to
                          other humans, it would be beneficial to include a human-like face in their software.[11] As people
                          already related to computers directly as they do with humans, the added human-like face emerged as
                          an annoying interloper distracting the user from the primary conversation.[11] First introduced in
                          Microsoft Office 97,[12] the Office Assistant was codenamed TFC during development.[13] It appeared
                          when the program determined the user could be assisted by using Office wizards, searching help, or
                          advising users on using Office features more effectively. It also presented tips and keyboard
                          shortcuts. For example, typing an address followed by "Dear" would cause the Assistant to appear
                          with the message, "It looks like you're writing a letter. Would you like help?" Microsoft turned
                          off the feature by default in Office XP.[14] The feature was removed altogether in Office 2007 and
                          Office 2008 for Mac.

                          The draft is conducted under the eligibility rules established in the league's 2017 collective
                          bargaining agreement (CBA) with its players' union, with special modifications agreed to by both
                          parties due to disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The previous CBA that ended the 2011
                          lockout instituted no immediate changes to the draft, but it called for a committee of owners and
                          players to discuss further charges. Players who were not automatically eligible had to declare
                          their eligibility for the draft by notifying the NBA offices in writing no later than at least 60
                          days before the event. For the 2023 draft, the date fell on April 23. Under the CBA a player may
                          withdraw his name from consideration from the draft at any time before the final declaration
                          deadline, which usually falls 10 days before the draft at 5:00 pm EDT (2100 UTC). Under current
                          NCAA rules, players usually have until 10 days after the draft combine to withdraw from the draft
                          and retain college eligibility. They must have withdrawn on or before May 31, 22 days prior to this
                          draft.[70] A player who has hired an agent retains his remaining college eligibility regardless of
                          whether he is drafted after an evaluation from the NBA Undergraduate Advisory Committee. Players
                          who declare for the NBA draft and are not selected have the opportunity to return to their school

                          works. Apple's first mixed reality headset is finally here and it's not cheap The Apple Vision Pro
                          is Apple's first official mixed reality headset. And you can see our first impressions in our Apple
                          Vision Pro hands-on review. And let's be clear — when we say mixed reality, we mean it. While the
                          headset may look like a contender for the best VR headset on the market, it is not designed to keep
                          you immersed in a virtual world. Features such as EyeSight and Digital Persona ensure that not only
                          are you still engaged with the physical world, but the physical world remains able to engage with
                          you. But, of course, these groundbreaking features come with an earth-shattering price. At $3,499,
                          the Apple Vision Pro is easily the most expensive mainstream headset — virtual reality or mixed
                          reality. And unfortunately, you'll have to wait a while to get your hands on it, since Apple says
                          it won't be available until 2024. Here's everything we know about the Apple Vision Pro. According
                          to Apple's launch presentation during the WWDC keynote, the Vision Pro will cost $3,499 at launch.
                          The headset will initially be available in the U.S. only, so we do not have pricing for other
                          countries at this time. Interestingly, one leaker claims Apple only spends $1,509 for each headset
                          it builds.

                          Pro is said to be the company's "high-end rival" to Meta's upcoming Quest Pro headset. N602 is
                          reportedly the successor to the first Apple Reality Pro headset and could come in at a lower price
                          point. N421 is Apple's long-rumored augmented reality glasses device, though Gurman cautioned that
                          it may not launch for some time. Gurman's latest report is the first concrete indication of what
                          Apple's first headset product could be called. It is worth noting that the "Reality Pro" name lines
                          up with Apple's recent trademark filings. Last week, Bloomberg reported that Apple has trademarked
                          several terms believed to be associated with its upcoming headset devices, including "Reality
                          Processor," "Reality Pro," and "Reality One.

                          works. Apple's first mixed reality headset is finally here and it's not cheap The Apple Vision Pro
                          is Apple's first official mixed reality headset. And you can see our first impressions in our Apple
                          Vision Pro hands-on review. And let's be clear — when we say mixed reality, we mean it. While the
                          headset may look like a contender for the best VR headset on the market, it is not designed to keep
                          you immersed in a virtual world. Features such as EyeSight and Digital Persona ensure that not only
                          are you still engaged with the physical world, but the physical world remains able to engage with
                          you. But, of course, these groundbreaking features come with an earth-shattering price. At $3,499,
                          the Apple Vision Pro is easily the most expensive mainstream headset — virtual reality or mixed
                          reality. And unfortunately, you'll have to wait a while to get your hands on it, since Apple says
                          it won't be available until 2024. Here's everything we know about the Apple Vision Pro. According
                          to Apple's launch presentation during the WWDC keynote, the Vision Pro will cost $3,499 at launch.
                          The headset will initially be available in the U.S. only, so we do not have pricing for other
                          countries at this time. Interestingly, one leaker claims Apple only spends $1,509 for each headset
                          it builds.

Question 300              : Who was the MVP of Super Bowl 2022?
Correct Answers         :  
                          Cooper Kupp
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - Source              :
                          So it was that Kupp hauled in the game-winning 1-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Matthew
                          Stafford with 1:25 left and became the eighth wide receiver to win Super Bowl MVP -- and the first
                          since Julian Edelman in Super Bowl LIII. Kupp, who was 7-1 to win MVP at Caesars Sportsbook,
                          finished with eight catches for 92 yards and two scores. The second touchdown capped a drive in
                          which Kupp, with the help of Stafford and some savvy tweaks from Rams coach Sean McVay, took over
                          the game. After a quick start, Kupp, who also won the NFL's receiving triple crown by leading the
                          league in receptions, yards and receiving touchdowns, didn't get the ball much. Fellow wideout
                          Odell Beckham Jr. suffered a left knee injury with 3:50 remaining in the first half, and with
                          Beckham out of the game, the Bengals threw everything they had at slowing Kupp. "Whatever it is, I
                          just want to execute my job to the best of my ability," Kupp said. "I trust that as the game goes
                          on, I will have opportunities, as well, and I just want to stay ready for those things, stay locked
                          in." In their first season as teammates, Matthew Stafford and Cooper Kupp connected for 22 TDs,
                          including the playoffs. It was the second most by a QB-receiver duo in a season in NFL history.

                          So it was that Kupp hauled in the game-winning 1-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Matthew
                          Stafford with 1:25 left and became the eighth wide receiver to win Super Bowl MVP -- and the first
                          since Julian Edelman in Super Bowl LIII. Kupp, who was 7-1 to win MVP at Caesars Sportsbook,
                          finished with eight catches for 92 yards and two scores. The second touchdown capped a drive in
