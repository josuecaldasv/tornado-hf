Question 2              : The genre of the drama "Good Sam" is what?

  - Source              :
                          Sam Griffith (Sophia Bush) is a female lead, still a rarity in medical dramas. The cast diversity
                          is notable: Malcolm Kinglsey (Edwin Hodge) is a Black man from a wealthy, prominent family. Wealthy
                          Black Americans aren't usually showcased on television. Malcolm is also a love interest for Sam,
                          adding to the representation of interracial relationships on television. However, most of the
                          diversity comes in the form of the secondary cast (Skye P. Marshall, Omar Maskati, Davi Santos),
                          who are very involved in the main storylines. Did we miss something on diversity? Suggest an
                          update. A scene with a major character being shot. Scenes of heart surgery. A scene with a patient
                          who was punched by his wife for cheating. Did you know you can flag iffy content? Adjust limits for

                          Parents should be aware of scenes featuring simulated heart surgery and other scary topics, such as
                          conversations about a near-fatal car accident, "coding" (needing to be resuscitated), and other
                          medical lingo.

  - Source              :
                          Edwin Hodge injects some diversity into the main cast as Malcolm Kingsley, a member of the wealthy
                          Kinglsey family who underwrites the funding for the hospital. As the hospital's new head of
                          finance, he also serves as a love interest for Sam, who is just getting over a previous
                          relationship. Sam's team of doctors (Skye P. Marshall, Omar Maskati, Davi Santos, Michael
                          Stahl-David) round out the secondary characters, most notably Marshall, who plays Dr. Lex Trulie,
                          her best friend hiding a huge secret. Overall, Good Sam riffs on what CBS is known for --
                          comforting problem-of-the-week dramas -- and adds a new level of spice and interest to the
                          proceedings. Fans of the genre will undoubtedly want to go on the ride Good Sam has in store for
                          them. Families can talk about familial relationships. What do you think about the relationships in
                          the series? What do you think is keeping the Griffith family from being closer? How does Sam
                          demonstrate great leadership? How does Sam provide compassion and empathy to her patients and
                          fellow doctors? Why does Sam feel unappreciated? How did she prove herself in the show? How should
                          Sam's father, Dr. Rob Griffith, treat his daughter? Research shows a connection between kids'
                          healthy self-esteem and positive portrayals in media. That's why we've added a new "Diverse
                          Representations" section to our reviews that will be rolling out on an ongoing basis.

                          ORLANDO, Fla. – The LSU offense exploded for 594 yards of total offense to defeat Purdue, 63-7, and
                          become Cheez-It Citrus Bowl Champions on Monday at Camping World Stadium. LSU finishes the season
                          with a 10-4 record. KEY PERFORMANCES Quarterback Jayden Daniels finished 12-of-17 for 139 yards and
                          a touchdown. Redshirt freshman Garrett Nussmeier went 10-of-14 for 98 yards with a touchdown and an

                          for 88 yards and a touchdown. Senior safety Greg Brooks shined on defense with five tackles, one
                          for loss, along with an interception. KEY PLAYS Purdue won the toss and deferred to the second
                          half. On 1st-and-10 from the LSU 44, Daniels found Taylor for a 19-yard completion to the Purdue
                          44. On 4th-and-2 from the 36, the Tigers elected to go for it, and Daniels connected with Nabers
                          for a 12-yard pickup to move the chains at the Boilermaker 24. Daniels then found Nabers again for
                          a 9-yard gain down to the Purdue 15.

                          Credit: Danny Karnik Credit: Danny Karnik Brent Key had just been named Georgia Tech’s interim
                          coach, and he was a man looking for solutions. To that end, he sat down with linebackers coach
                          Jason Semore to understand how the team could stop getting its punts blocked. “Coach Key kind of
                          asked me, ‘What do you see the issues are, how do you get this fixed?’” Semore said in an interview
                          with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. “‘If you were to fix it, what would you do?’” It was a
                          question that Semore had been asking himself since the season opener, when Clemson blocked two
                          punts en route to its 41-10 win at Mercedes-Benz Stadium. On his own, he had been researching
                          different teams’ punt-protection schemes, calling colleagues and putting together a video package
                          of about 160 punt plays. It wasn’t about determining the best punt scheme. He was looking for an
                          effective but uncomplicated protection that could be taught quickly, that would be comfortable for
                          punter David Shanahan to work with and that, if a player made a mistake, could still give Shanahan
                          a chance to get the punt off. He considered how the scheme could be best taught in a week’s time,
                          day by day. Semore mulled over the questions, making use of the sleepless nights he endured as the
                          Yellow Jackets stumbled out of the gate and ultimately had four punts blocked in their first four
                          games.

                          By the way of the Q4 2021 financial report, Tesla announced the final vehicle delivery numbers for
                          the fourth quarter and full-year 2021, which as usual, are marginally higher than in the
                          preliminary report. The company noted record production and delivery numbers for both Q4 and 2021,
                          as well as record operating margin and a record low global vehicle inventory. The results,
                          visualized below, are truly remarkable. Let's take a look at the details and then check out the
                          outlook. Tesla produced 305,840 electric cars and delivered 308,650 during the period, which both
                          are record numbers. The growth is associated with the Model 3/Model Y, as the Model S/Model X are
                          in the ramp-up phase after a major refresh. As we can see, the global vehicle inventory (days of
                          supply) further decreased to just 4 days. That's an amazing result and a true sign of how high the
                          imbalance is between demand and supply. In 2021, Tesla produced 930,422 electric cars and delivered
                          936,222. It's a new record. The global vehicle inventory (days of supply) shows a fairly consistent
                          decrease from 28 days in 2017, to 22 in 2018, 13-15 in 2019-2020 and 6 most recently. Another look:
                          The 12-month rolling deliveries are now above 936,000.

                          Super Bowl LVI[12] was an American football game played to determine the champion of the National

                          the Detroit Lions. The Bengals, who finished with a 10–7 record, were seeking their first Super
                          Bowl title following several decades of losing seasons and playoff struggles. They won their first
                          playoff game since 1990, ending the longest drought in the four major North American sports, en
                          route to their third Super Bowl appearance and first since 1988's Super Bowl XXIII.

                          the time it was the St Louis Rams. The Cincinnati Bengals are still yet to win a Super Bowl after

                          On February 21, 2022, Truth Social was released on Apple iOS,[98] reaching number one on the App
                          Store's top charts.[99][100] Due to an extensive backlog of applicants, upon downloading the app,
                          about 500,000 people who initially attempted to register as users were automatically
                          waitlisted.[101][102][103] The app was installed 872,000 times during its first week, but a month
                          later, new user signup had fallen to 60,000 per week. During that time, weekly visits to
                          truthsocial.com fell from 6 million to fewer than 2 million.[104] Upon its launch, the British
                          automotive solar power company Trailar complained Truth Social's app logo closely resembled its "T"
                          logo.[105] The platform has been criticized for its poor performance at launch, with waitlisting
                          users attempting to register and extended outages.[106] A day after its launch, The Washington Post
                          described it as "a disaster".[101] A week after, Newsweek reported some early adopters were
                          beginning to lose interest in the app due to low numbers of users and poor engagement, although
                          others were willing to persevere with the app to see if things would improve.[107] The Truth Social
                          platform suffered from severe and persistent problems with scalability at launch, limiting the
                          platform's growth.[108][109]

                          With the Android app still unavailable, not a lot has actually changed since Truth Social launched
                          on iPhone. However, there's a workaround. The Truth Social app is still not available to download
                          on Android devices, although it is expected to arrive at some point in the near future. Truth
                          Social is a much newer social media network compared to the likes of Facebook and Twitter, and it
                          is one that promises to offer an open platform that doesn’t discriminate against users based on
                          their political ideology. In fact, this political ideology promise is exactly why Truth Social came
                          to be in the first place. Following the wide banning of Donald Trump across multiple social media
                          network sites in 2021, an alternative service that didn’t censor its users was advertised as in the
                          works. In February of 2022, that alternative service manifested in the launch of Truth Social on
                          iPhone. At the time, Android support was understood to be coming, but there's was no clear
                          indication of when. Related: Trump's Truth Social Posts On Other Platforms Delay, Explained In
                          terms of Android support, not a lot has actually changed since then, and it remains unknown when
                          Truth Social will be available to download from the Google Play Store. Comments last month from the
                          Truth Social CEO confirmed the app was still en route, explaining that it was waiting on approval
                          from Google before it can be made available via the Play Store. How long that approval process
                          takes typically depends on the app.

                          about 500,000 people who initially attempted to register as users were automatically
                          waitlisted.[101][102][103] The app was installed 872,000 times during its first week, but a month
                          later, new user signup had fallen to 60,000 per week. During that time, weekly visits to
                          truthsocial.com fell from 6 million to fewer than 2 million.[104] Upon its launch, the British
                          automotive solar power company Trailar complained Truth Social's app logo closely resembled its "T"
                          logo.[105] The platform has been criticized for its poor performance at launch, with waitlisting
                          users attempting to register and extended outages.[106] A day after its launch, The Washington Post
                          described it as "a disaster".[101] A week after, Newsweek reported some early adopters were
                          beginning to lose interest in the app due to low numbers of users and poor engagement, although
                          others were willing to persevere with the app to see if things would improve.[107] The Truth Social
                          platform suffered from severe and persistent problems with scalability at launch, limiting the
                          platform's growth.[108][109]

                          Mirroring a protocol adopted for the 2020 Summer Olympics before they were moved behind closed
                          doors, the IOC also announced that only residents of the People's Republic of China would be
                          permitted to attend the Games as spectators.[38][39] On 23 December 2021, the National Hockey

                          to withdraw their players' participation in the Games' men's hockey tournament, citing concerns
                          over COVID-19 and the need to make up games that had been postponed due to COVID-19 outbreak[40] As
                          part of their latest collective agreement with the NHLPA, the NHL had agreed to accommodate a break

                          numbers of spectators would be admitted by invitation only. These, therefore, became the second
                          Olympics in a row that were closed to the general public.

                          by an appeals court. The move means Microsoft and Activision can now try to persuade the U.S.

                          after learning his feature on Black Wall Street had won an Emmy Award, Lockett was honored again on
                          Thursday night as the 2022 Seattle Male Sports Star of The Year. The live awards show has been a
                          tradition in Emerald City dating back to 1936. Created by the Seattle Post-Intelligencer and
                          renowned sports editor Royal Brougham, the show has honored some of the biggest names to play
                          professional sports in the city. Since arriving in Seattle from Kansas State in 2015, Lockett has
                          developed into a reliable and incredibly productive receiver in the Seahawks offense, and 2021 was
                          arguably his best season yet, setting a career high with 1,175 receiving yards, his
                          third-consecutive 1,000-yard season. The successes have continued off the field. Lockett received
                          the 2021 Steve Largent Award, given annually to the team contributor who best exemplifies the
                          spirit, dedication, and integrity of the Seahawks. He was also the Seahawks nominee for the NFL's
                          Walter Payton Man of the Year Award, recognizing a player for their excellence on and off the
                          field. And if that wasn't enough, Lockett passed his real estate licensing exam earlier this
                          offseason, selling his first home in April.

                          Project Iris is the codename for an unreleased augmented reality (AR) headset designed and
                          developed by Google. Intended to resemble ordinary eyeglasses and for a 2024 release, it was
                          canceled in early 2023. Following the highly publicized failure of Google Glass smartglasses in
                          2013, Google executives were initially disinclined to re-enter the field of wearable AR technology.
                          However, by 2021, work had begun on a new AR headset, later reported to be codenamed Project Iris.
                          After going through numerous iterations, Google unveiled a version of Iris at the 2022 Google I/O
                          keynote before publicly testing prototype models later that year. The following year, Google was
                          reported to have abandoned the project in the midst of company-wide layoffs and internal turmoil.
                          Google first experimented with the prospect of smartglasses with the introduction of Google Glass
                          in 2013.[1] The product was panned by critics due to privacy and ethical concerns,[2] leading
                          Google to discontinue the consumer-facing model and focus on the enterprise model.

                          Unlike organic light-emitting diode OLED technology, MicroLED and Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) are
                          also inorganic, but it has the same qualities as OLED such as high brightness, good color fidelity,
                          high resolution, and high contrast. What's more, MicroLED is much less energy efficient, a key
                          requirement for wearable devices such as AR headsets. This is one of the reasons why technology has

                          Unlike organic light-emitting diode OLED technology, MicroLED and Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) are
                          also inorganic, but it has the same qualities as OLED such as high brightness, good color fidelity,
                          high resolution, and high contrast. What's more, MicroLED is much less energy efficient, a key
                          requirement for wearable devices such as AR headsets. This is one of the reasons why technology has
                          become a key technology for strategic investment in the smart glasses sector. Although Raxium has
                          not yet launched a marketed product, it has reportedly developed a more effective MicroLED
                          manufacturing technology that will use the same silicon as the raw material for most processors for
                          manufacturing and will significantly reduce production costs. Currently, MicroLED technology is
                          mainly used only for wall-mounted signs and other large and expensive screens. In addition to
                          Google, many other hardware companies are also investing and developing in the MicroLED field. For

Question 18              : What is the name of Meta's AI supercomputer?
Correct Answers         :  
                          RSC, the AI Research SuperCluster

                          Image Credits: Meta But beyond keeping up with the Joneses, Meta says that the RSC confers the
                          benefit of allowing its researchers to train models using real-world examples from Meta’s
                          production systems. That’s unlike the company’s previous AI infrastructure, which leveraged only
                          open source and publicly available datasets. “The RSC AI supercomputer is used for pushing the
                          boundaries of AI research in several domains, including generative AI,” a Meta spokesperson said.
                          “It’s really about AI research productivity. We wanted to provide AI researchers with a
                          state-of-the-art infrastructure for them to be able to develop models and empower them with a
                          training platform to advance AI.” At its peak, the RSC can reach nearly 5 exaflops of computing
                          power, which the company claims makes it among the world’s fastest. (Lest that impress, it’s worth
                          noting some experts view the exaflops performance metric with a pinch of salt and that the RSC is
                          far outgunned by many of the world’s fastest supercomputers.) Meta says that it used the RSC to
                          train LLaMA, a tortured acronym for “Large Language Model Meta AI” — a large language model that
                          the company shared as a “gated release” to researchers earlier in the year (and which subsequently
                          leaked in various internet communities). The largest LLaMA model was trained on 2,048 A100 GPUs,
                          Meta says, which took 21 days.

                          Meta pulled the plug on a large-scale rollout of the custom chip, which was planned for 2022, and
                          instead placed orders for billions of dollars’ worth of Nvidia GPUs that required major redesigns
                          of several of its data centers. In an effort to turn things around, Meta made plans to start
                          developing a more ambitious in-house chip, due out in 2025, capable of both training AI models and
                          running them. And that was the main topic of today’s presentation. Meta calls the new chip the Meta
                          Training and Inference Accelerator, or MTIA for short, and describes it as a part of a “family” of
                          chips for accelerating AI training and inferencing workloads. (“Inferencing” refers to running a
                          trained model.) The MTIA is an ASIC, a kind of chip that combines different circuits on one board,
                          allowing it to be programmed to carry out one or many tasks in parallel. An AI chip Meta

                          distance with eight events completed before the Olympics, followed by Golikova and Kodaira.

                          Lost Ark was fully released in South Korea on December 4, 2019, and in North American, South
                          American, and European regions on February 11, 2022, with Amazon Games serving as the global
                          publisher.[16] Users that pre-purchased one of four founder's packs could play 3 days early on
                          February 8, 2022.[17][18][19][20] The game was initially unavailable in Belgium and the Netherlands
                          due to the countries' stringent loot box regulations,[21] with the latter later reversing its
                          decision.[22] Within twenty-four hours of its release, Lost Ark became the second most played game
                          on Steam.[23][24] In 2021, there were plans between Smilegate and game publisher HappyTuk [zh] to
                          launch Lost Ark in Taiwan.[25] It was announced in 2023 that the release of Taiwanese servers has
                          been delayed but not canceled.[26] Lost Ark received "generally favorable" reviews according to
                          review aggregator Metacritic.[27] PC Magazine praised Lost Ark's combat, writing, "Abilities look
                          good, sound sufficiently powerful, and feel great to use. You can’t help but feel like a combat god
                          when you divekick a crowd, and blast fodder monsters into bloody chunks.

                          What if you don’t want to purchase a Lost Ark Founder’s Pack and just want to dive into the game
                          once it leaves Early Access and becomes a publically available free-to-play title? Well, the good
                          news is that you’ll soon have a chance to do just that. Ad Ad – content continues below Lost Ark is
                          set to be publically released via Steam as a free-to-play title on February 11th. You can pre-load
                          the game via that platform starting right now (its download size checks in at about 70 GB), but
                          unless you’re willing to buy a Founder’s Pack between now and then, you will need to wait for the
                          title to be fully unlocked before you’ll be able to launch it. As for the release time…well, that’s
                          a little tricky. Ideally, the free-to-play version of Lost Ark will launch via Steam on February 11
                          at the following times: 9 AM PST 12 PM EST5 PM GMT6 PM CETThe reason I say “ideally” in regards to
                          Lost Ark‘s free-to-play launch time is that we already saw players struggle to join Lost Ark in
                          time for its exact Early Access debut. Between congested servers and a few technical issues, many
                          fans found themselves waiting at least a little longer to actually start playing the MMO. Given
                          that the game is being opened up to a significantly larger player base on Friday, it’s likely that
                          you’ll have to navigate similar server issues at that time.

                          October 30, 2020 • 3 For the last decade, Marvel has led the adaptations of superhero comic books
                          into films. In 2019, the journey culminated in the release of Avengers: Endgame, which premiered to
                          critical and commercial success. It had gone from a story about a playboy billionaire (Tony
                          Stark/Iron Man) to a larger story than spanned universes as well as heroes and villains alike.
                          Although, as the universe expanded, it was hard to ignore that Marvel’s roster of superheroes still
                          lacked diversity. This was made even more apparent when other superhero stories started to make
                          their way into the mainstream. In the same year that Endgame came out, a quiet and subversive TV
                          show was making waves. The Boys is adapted from a graphic novel of the same name, one that is
                          notorious amongst fans and haters alike for its crude, graphic and violent nature. The series
                          considers what would happen if superheroes existed in the real world. The short answer is that they
                          would become an untouchable commodity that could wreak havoc, which would be cleaned up by their
                          slick and all-powerful parent company Vought. The series touches on power, social media, politics
                          and causes the line between hero and villain to become truly blurred. It is difficult not to draw
                          comparisons between the storylines in The Boys and the reality of the MCU (Marvel Cinematic
                          Universe).

                          "Nazism is Russia-phobia to them. So the Ukrainians are Nazis because they're anti-Russian." Putin
                          also promotes this Nazi idea to win support in the West, where people have always been
                          "susceptible" to the argument that Ukraine has a Nazi problem, Hall said. He said Putin's strategy
                          is partly "throw things at the wall and see what sticks." According to Graham, there is no evidence
                          that Putin was under public pressure to invade Ukraine, which suggests at least some of his
                          reasoning was personal. All three experts said Putin's desire to be revered in history books likely
                          motivated him to attack. Hall said Putin's anxiety is around "am I going to be a footnote in
                          Russian history or are they going to write books about me like they do Peter the Great, Catherine
                          the Great, Stalin." Taylor agrees, saying that Putin sees himself as "a great historic Russian
                          leader restoring Russian lands, and he was thinking about his legacy as he turned 70." "What have
                          the great Czars done? They've expanded Russian territory," Graham said. Even with all of the above,
                          why the invasion happened when it did is an intriguing question. Experts pointed to multiple
                          reasons why Russia invaded in February 2022. One was the arrival of Zelenskyy, who came to power in
                          2019 after a career as a comedian and actor. Putin believed that in Zelenskyy "he had someone he
                          could manipulate in Ukraine," Hall said.

                          11] As of January 2022, Świątek has reached the second week of a Grand Slam at six consecutive
                          majors, beginning with her 2020 French Open title, setting a record for the longest streak of
                          second-week progressions.[12] In the quarterfinal she defeated Kaia Kanepi in a match at three
                          hours and one minute before losing to Danielle Collins in the semifinal the following day.[13][14]
                          In February, Świątek entered into the Qatar Open, where she was seeded seventh. She defeated
                          Viktorija Golubic and Daria Kasatkina in the second and third rounds, respectively. In the
                          quarterfinals, she defeated top seeded Aryna Sabalenka before advancing to the semifinals where she
                          played against Maria Sakkari, winning in straight sets. In the final, she won against fourth-seeded
                          Anett Kontaveit, losing only two games, to claim her second WTA 1000 championship title.[15] At
                          Indian Wells, Świątek reached her third WTA 1000 final, where, as the third seed, she defeated
                          Anhelina Kalinina, Clara Tauson and Angelique Kerber in three sets, and Madison Keys and Simona
                          Halep, in straight sets. She defeated sixth seed Maria Sakkari, in straight sets, to win her fifth
                          title. With the back-to-back Masters wins, Świątek reached a career-high ranking of world No. 2.[16]

                          Published Feb 18, 2023 Are we at the start of a new streak? For the second year in a row, Iga
                          Swiatek leaves the Qatar TotalEnergies Open undefeated, knocking out Jessica Pegula, 6-3, 6-0 to
                          win her 12th career title in Doha with the loss of five total games in three matches.Swiatek rode a
                          37-match win streak that began in the Middle East and took her to a whopping six titles in
                          2022—including a Sunshine Double and a second Roland Garros title—and after an underwhelming start
                          to her season, the world No. 1 is back in the winner’s circle without dropping a set, defeating
                          Pegula in one hour and nine minutes on Center Court.Her trip Down Under indeed yielded less than
                          her sky-high expectations, featuring a first loss to Pegula since 2019 at United Cup and a
                          fourth-round exit at the Australian Open to Elena Rybakina. Playing her first tournament since
                          Melbourne, all eyes were on the Pole as she aimed to reassert her dominance over the tour.

                          The second set was entirely different from the first. While Jabeur again didn't win a game until
                          Swiatek was up 3-0, she finally found her gear. Her excellent slice finally began to appear and she
                          began going to the net more, helping her win four of the next five games. Swiatek appeared to have
                          finally wrestled the momentum of the match back to her side, breaking a 5-5 tie to get within one
                          game of the title, but she couldn't close and Jabeur tied it up once again. The tiebreak was close,
                          and it looked like Jabeur could run away with it at any moment, but an unforced error from Jabeur
                          ended the tiebreak and gave Swiatek her first US Open championship and her third career Grand Slam
                          trophy. When it was all over, Swiatek and Jabeur shared a heartfelt embrace, and then Swiatek
                          immediately burst into happy tears. She'd earned it. This victory puts an exclamation point on the
                          best year of Swiatek's young career — or the best year of anyone’s career, really. She started 2022
                          by falling just short of the finals at the Australian Open (she was knocked out in the semis by
                          Danielle Collins), but she rebounded to produce one of the most dominant stretches of tennis we’ve
                          seen in decades. Swiatek beat Annet Kontaveit to win the Qatar Open.

                          ended when Vance Honeycutt’s first home run landed on West 4th Street. When his second home run
                          landed in almost the same spot, it was celebration time for the Tar Heels, sadness for the
                          Wolfpack. North Carolina defeated N.C. State, 9-5, to win the 2022 ACC tournament title Sunday, the
                          eighth title in school history and first for the Tar Heels since 2019. Carolina won three straight
                          ACC tournament titles from 1982-84 and won it again in 1990 before adding championships in 2007 and
                          2019. Scott Forbes, the Tar Heels’ second-year skipper, won a championship in his first attempt.
                          The title still eludes N.C. State head coach Elliott Avent, in his 26th season. “ACC champs,”
                          Forbes said, tossing his hands in the air. “Our whole approach was we wanted to win an ACC
                          championship for the University of North Carolina, we just happened to be playing N.C. State.” N.C.
                          State hasn’t won an ACC title since 1992. They are 0-8 in title games since then. Sunday’s showdown
                          was the first time since 1990 that the Tar Heels and Wolfpack played in a title game. Carolina won
                          that contest, 5-0.

                          Apple didn't specify how much faster the A16 is, compared with the A15. The new iPhone 14 Pro
                          series uses the new A16 Bionic processor. Apple on Wednesday unveiled the A16 Bionic at its launch
                          event for the iPhone 14, touting the 16 billion transistor processor as the highest performing ever
                          for smartphones. But Apple didn't detail how much faster it is than last year's A15, and it's not
                          likely to major a big speed boost. The A16 Bionic, built on a 4-nanometer process, sports a faster
                          design with six CPU cores -- the same combination of two powerful and four efficient cores Apple
                          has used for years. Apple didn't say how much faster the A16's high-performance cores are compared
                          with those on the A15, but they use 20% less power, which helps battery life. For the four
                          efficiency cores, Apple didn't offer any comparisons to the A15. "I think the A16 is very
                          incremental over the A15," said Anshel Sag, an analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy. Instead of
                          processor speed, Apple "focused explicitly on camera performance and battery life." Without big
                          manufacturing process improvements that shrink transistors, the core data processing circuitry on a
                          chip, designers have a harder time adding features that increase the transistor total. That
                          includes upgrades like more graphics processing units and accelerators for increasingly important
                          artificial intelligence software.

                          The iPhone 14 and 14 Plus feature the same camera system with two cameras: one front-facing camera
                          (12MP f/1.9), and two back-facing cameras: a wide (12MP f/1.5) and ultra-wide (12MP f/2.4) camera,
                          with the wide and front-facing cameras having a faster aperture than the iPhone 13. The
                          front-facing camera also has autofocus for the first time.[30] The cameras use Apple's latest
                          computational photography engine, called Smart HDR 4. Users can also choose from a range of
                          photographic styles during capture, including rich contrast, vibrant, warm, and cool. Apple
                          clarifies this is different from a filter because it works intelligently with the image processing
                          algorithm during capture to apply local adjustments to an image, and the effects will be baked into
                          the photos, unlike filters which can be removed after applying.[6] The camera app contains

                          Google has released the Google I/O 2022 schedule, giving us a brief overview of what to expect.
                          Read on to know more. We’re just two weeks away from Google I/O 2022. While the yearly event is
                          primarily targeted at developers, there will be plenty of fun stuff for enthusiasts and the general
                          public. Google usually doesn’t reveal much about what it plans to announce at the event. However,
                          the company has now released the Google I/O 2022 schedule, giving us a brief overview of what to
                          expect. Google I/O 2022 will be held on May 11 and May 12 at the Shoreline Amphitheater. The event
                          will kick off with Sundar Pichai’s “Google I/O keynote” at 10 AM. This will be the main attraction
                          for the general population as the main event tends to be more consumer-focused. While the event’s
                          description doesn’t provide specifics, expect to see announcements for popular Google services,
                          Workspace, privacy, health, and Google’s other new projects and endeavors. Also, keep an eye out
                          for potential hardware announcements in the form of the Pixel 6a, Pixel Watch, and smart home
                          devices. The main keynote will be followed by the Developer keynote and “What’s new in Android.”
                          This is where we expect to learn more about Android 13, Wear OS, and updates to developer products
                          and tools. Google says the schedule is slightly different this year.

                          Google I/O 2023 is expected to see the launch of new Pixel devices, AI tools, and more. Here's the
                          complete lowdown, and how you can watch yourself. Google I/O is a developer event that always opens
                          with a keynote during which Google unveils a host of new hardware and software products. Many fans
                          are waiting to see what the company will unveil in 2023. If you're one of them, here's what you can
                          expect to see, and how you can watch the event online when it airs on May 10th. Google I/O 2023 is
                          scheduled for Wednesday, May 10th, and will take place at Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View,
                          California. The in-person event will be hosted live for a small audience, but you can watch it
                          online when it airs on the Google I/O website or head over to Google's YouTube channel. Although
                          Google I/O is meant primarily for developers, the opening keynote will unveil the company's latest
                          consumer products and services, and perhaps even a sneak peek into products coming later this year.
                          Google hasn't officially revealed what it plans to show at I/O, but we can make some smart guesses
                          based on things Google revealed at I/O 2022 last year and credible rumors. Here are some of the
                          things we expect to see at Google I/O 2023.

                          a film adaption of graphic comics Irredeemable and its spinoff Incorruptible. Directed by Samuel
                          with co-production from Hov and James Lassiter, Kemp Powers, whose credits include 2021 Disney+

                          On December 31, 2021, the Tianwen-1 orbiter deployed a second deployable camera (TDC-2) into Mars
                          orbit which captured photographs of the Tianwen-1 in orbit to celebrate its achievement of the
                          year[20] and a selfie stick payload was deployed to its working position on orbiter to take images
                          of the orbiter's components and Chinese flag on 30 January 2022 to celebrate the Chinese New Year.
                          In September 2022, the mission was awarded the World Space Award by the International Astronautical
                          Federation.[35][36] The Tianwen-1 mission was the second of three Martian exploration missions
                          launched during the July 2020 window, after the United Arab Emirates Space Agency's Hope orbiter,
                          and before NASA's Mars 2020 mission, which landed the Perseverance rover with the attached
                          Ingenuity helicopter drone.[37] China's planetary exploration program is officially dubbed the
                          "Tianwen Series". "Tianwen-1" (Chinese: 天问一号) is the program's first mission, and subsequent
                          planetary missions will be numbered sequentially.[38] The name Tianwen means "questions to heaven"
                          or "quest for heavenly truth", from the same classical poem written by Qu Yuan (c. 340–278 BC), an

                          unprecedented induction that displayed his various Deadman genres on mannequins, Calaway made a

                          Lost City,” but in real life, Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum share a very different kind of
                          bond: They’re play-date parents. On a lively Zoom call with their “Lost City” co-star Daniel
                          Radcliffe, Bullock and Tatum described what it’s like now that her daughter, Laila, and his
                          daughter, Everly, have both reached the sleepover stage. “Daniel, you’ll experience this one day,”
                          Bullock said. “It’s a major coup when you can safely allow your child to go to someone else’s house
                          without thinking they’re going to die.” In “The Lost City” (in theaters March 25), Bullock plays
                          romance novelist Loretta Sage, whose life is on autopilot until she’s kidnapped by a rich eccentric
                          (Radcliffe) who believes she can lead him to a hidden treasure buried deep in the jungle.

                          Advertisement Supported by Nearly a year after Smith smacked the comedian across the face at the
                          Academy Awards, Rock gave the stunning episode the full stand-up treatment. By Julia Jacobs Nearly
                          a year after Will Smith slapped him onstage at the Oscars, Chris Rock joked about the explosive
                          moment on a live Netflix show Saturday night, using the last few minutes to mock Smith and his
                          wife, Jada Pinkett Smith. “Now I watch ‘Emancipation,’ just to see him get whooped,” Rock said,
                          referencing last year’s Civil War-era drama in which Smith plays an enslaved man who is forced to
                          labor for the Confederacy. In the days after Smith stunned the world with the slap, Rock, a
                          comedian not known to shy away from controversy, was expected to quickly make his feelings about
                          the episode known. Instead, he said at his first show after the Oscars that he was still processing
                          what had happened, and he assured fans that there would be a time and place for him to discuss it
                          in depth. That time and place turned out to be Saturday, at the Hippodrome Theater in Baltimore, in
                          a stand-up show that was live-streamed for the rest of the world. At times, Rock made himself the
                          target of his own jokes, noting Smith’s larger build. “Will Smith does movies with his shirt off,”
                          said Rock, pacing the stage in his white outfit. “You never seen me do a movie with my shirt off.

  - Source              :
                          [14][17][18][19] Many Internet memes and parodies have been created from the photo and
                          video.[29][30] On March 31, additional smartphone footage was published from an audience member's
                          perspective of the Smiths' table. This seems to show the reaction of Pinkett Smith during and after
                          the joke, as unamused and rolling her eyes during the joke but then seeming to laugh when Rock
                          commented, "Will Smith just smacked the shit out of me." and "That was a ... greatest night in the
                          history of television."[31] In a statement on March 30, the Academy said Smith had been asked to
                          leave the ceremony but refused.[32] However, others who were present in the room denied that Smith
                          was ever asked, either directly or through a representative, to leave; disagreement ensued between
                          members of the academy's leadership and ceremony producer Will Packer on whether Smith should be
                          allowed to stay, which led to no action being taken.[33] Variety reported that Packer "was the key
                          to Smith remaining in his seat".[33] In a subsequent interview with Good Morning America, Packer
                          said he opposed suggestions to remove Smith from the theater because he did not believe that Rock
                          would want it.[34] Within forty minutes, Smith was presented the award for Best Actor for his
                          portrayal of Richard Williams in King Richard.

  - Source              :
                          In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Kenny shared that he thinks Smith’s apology was nothing
                          more than a PR move. “No, I don’t accept it because I don’t think it was genuine,” he said. “I
                          think his publicist and the people that work under him probably advised him to do that.” (Another
                          of Rock’s other brothers, Tony, also said he does not accept Smith’s apology and said the entire
                          fiasco was “foul.”) He continued, “I might have looked at it differently had he initially
                          apologized when he got on the stage and cried and accepted the award, but he didn’t, so, right
                          there that tells me that it is something else.” As for Smith remaining in the ceremony after
                          slapping Rock, and later accepting the best actor award for his role in King Richard? Kenny (as
                          well as other celebrities in attendance) believes that was a misstep on the Academy’s part. “He
                          should have been escorted out of there,” he said. “I hold them accountable for that. He could have
                          went up there and did anything you wanted to my brother. It could have been much worse than what he
                          did.” Kenny added that Smith “belittled my brother. He had no respect for him. … In my opinion, he
                          embarrassed himself by doing that and his legacy by doing that.”

                          performance and capabilities to the completely redesigned MacBook Air and updated 13-inch MacBook
                          Pro CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA Apple today announced M2, beginning the next generation of Apple silicon
                          designed specifically for the Mac. Built using second-generation 5-nanometer technology, M2 takes
                          the industry-leading performance per watt of M1 even further with an 18 percent faster CPU, a 35
                          percent more powerful GPU, and a 40 percent faster Neural Engine.1 It also delivers 50 percent more
                          memory bandwidth compared to M1, and up to 24GB of fast unified memory. M2 brings all of this —
                          plus new custom technologies and greater efficiency — to the completely redesigned MacBook Air and
                          updated 13-inch MacBook Pro. “M2 starts the second generation of M-series chips and goes beyond the
                          remarkable features of M1,” said Johny Srouji, Apple’s senior vice president of Hardware
                          Technologies. “With our relentless focus on power-efficient performance, M2 delivers a faster CPU,
                          GPU, and Neural Engine. And along with higher memory bandwidth and new capabilities like ProRes
                          acceleration, M2 continues the tremendous pace of innovation in Apple silicon for the Mac.

                          Apple in June 2022 unveiled the M2, its next-generation Apple silicon chip that followed the M1
                          chip. This guide highlights everything you need to know about the M2 chip, from performance
                          improvements to extra features. The M2 is Apple's next-generation System on a Chip (SoC) developed
                          for use in Macs and iPads. It marks Apple's continued work to transition away from the Intel chips
                          that were used in Macs up until 2020. As a "System on a Chip," the M2 integrates several different
                          components, including the CPU, GPU, unified memory architecture (RAM), Neural Engine, Secure
                          Enclave, SSD controller, image signal processor, encode/decode engines, Thunderbolt controller with
                          USB 4 support, and more, all of which power the different features in the Mac. Before Apple
                          silicon, Macs used multiple chips for CPU, I/O, and security, but Apple's effort to integrate these
                          chips is the reason why the M2 is much faster and more efficient than Intel chips. The unified
                          memory architecture that Apple has included is also a major factor because all of the technologies
                          in the M2 are able to access the same data without having to swap between multiple pools of memory.
                          Built into the M2 chip, the unified memory architecture means the CPU, GPU, and other processor
                          components don't need to copy data between one another, and are able to access the same data pool.

Question 43              : What film won the 2022 Academy Award for Best Picture?

                          The 94th Academy Awards were held on Sunday night at the Dolby Theater in Hollywood. “CODA,” a
                          relatively small-scale drama once considered an underdog, won the award for best picture, becoming
                          the first film distributed by a streaming service to win Hollywood’s top honor. (“CODA” was
                          released by Apple TV+, which purchased the movie after it played at the Sundance Film Festival in
                          2021.) The night’s most awarded movie was “Dune,” which won in six categories including
                          cinematography and production design. The best director honor went to Jane Campion, whose
                          subversive western, “The Power of the Dog,” was the most nominated movie of the night. Campion’s
                          victory was important for Oscars history: This year’s ceremony became the first time that the best
                          director Oscar has gone to women twice in a row. (Chloé Zhao won last year for “Nomadland”; Campion
                          had already made history by being the first woman to be nominated for best director twice.) Will
                          Smith (“King Richard”) won the best actor category; Jessica Chastain (“The Eyes of Tammy Faye”) won
                          for best actress. Ariana DeBose (“West Side Story”) received the best supporting actress award,
                          becoming the first openly queer woman of color to win an acting Oscar.

                          Yes, a big win here for 19-year-old Olivia Rodrigo would be a win for vivid teenage emotions
                          rendered in attentive melodic detail. But it would also be a para-victory for Eilish (who swept the
                          top four Grammy categories in 2020) and Swift (a three-time album of the year winner), as well as a
                          potential embarrassment for the Recording Academy, which too often reduces artists to types — in
                          this case, the precocious songwriter-dynamo type whose hit singles live at the top of the charts.
                          For Rodrigo, that hit was “Drivers License,” a power ballad fueled by adolescent confusion and the
                          desire to accelerate into an unwritten future. If Rodrigo takes home the night’s biggest trophy, it
                          should be for her musical imagination, not the Grammy electorate’s lack of one. Unfettered thoughts
                          that appeared in the mind of a 42-year-old White man upon hearing the debut full-length from Lil
                          Nas X, a 22-year-old Black man, the day it dropped, Sept. 17, 2021: Why isn’t this weird? Why make
                          such freaky-deaky music videos for such normy sounding pop songs? Does Lil Nas X want to be normal?
                          I grew up being made to feel I was normal, which made me want to be weird, made me want to get
                          weird haircuts, like weird music and have a bad attitude about all of it without anyone giving me
                          too much of a hard time.

                          had won the event twice previously.[246] Early goals from Lionel Messi and Ángel Di María gave
                          Argentina, leading 2–0, a head start against the French.[246][247] Despite multiple substitutions
                          in the first half, France did not record a shot until after the 70th minute but were energised by
                          additional substitutions in the 71st. A few minutes later, France were awarded a penalty as Randal

                          minute after his shot hit the arm of Gonzalo Montiel. Mbappé scored his third goal, becoming the

                          April 2 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) on Sunday posted record quarterly vehicle deliveries, but
                          quarter-on-quarter sales growth was modest despite price cuts as rising competition and a bleak
                          economic outlook weighed. Tesla delivered 422,875 vehicles for the first three months of this year,
                          up 4% from the previous quarter. This was 36% higher than a year ago. In January, Chief Executive
                          Elon Musk said Tesla could achieve 2 million vehicle deliveries this year, up 52% from last year.
                          Investors have been watching Musk's gamble that cutting prices would stimulate sales, although they
                          worry about eroding margins. In January, Tesla slashed prices globally by as much as 20%,
                          unleashing a price war after missing Wall Street delivery estimates for 2022. The basic Model Y
                          that used to sell for $65,990 now costs $54,990. "If they wouldn't have done the price cut, it
                          would have been ugly. I think what it tells you is the economy is getting tough," Gene Munster,
                          managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, said on Sunday. "They showed an acceleration, but
                          they didn't accelerate to the level that Elon had suggested it would." Musk, who has missed his own
                          ambitious sales targets for Tesla in recent years, said in January that 2023 deliveries could hit 2
                          million vehicles, absent external disruption, from 1.3 million in 2022.

                          of Twitter, the company confirmed in a securities filing Friday, putting the world’s richest man in
                          charge of one of the world’s most influential social media platforms. The company said the deal
                          “became effective” on Thursday, as part of a filing notifying its intention to de-list from the New
                          York Stock Exchange, a move that happened later on Friday. The confirmation comes after a source
                          familiar with the deal told CNN the deal had closed Thursday night. Musk also appeared to

                          would complete the buyout by the deadline.[163] Musk made a trip to Twitter's headquarters on
                          October 26, tweeting a video of him carrying a kitchen sink at the site's lobby and changing his
                          Twitter bio to "Chief Twit".[164][165][166] Musk also told Twitter employees that while layoffs
                          were still likely to happen, he did not intend to do so at the scale the Post had previously
                          reported.[167][168] The next day, Musk wrote in an open letter to advertisers that Twitter would
                          not become a "free-for-all hellscape", reiterating that his motives for the purchase were not based
                          on greed but rather a desire to create "a common digital town square".[169] He then asked Tesla
                          engineers to meet with Twitter's product managers in order to assess the platform's codebase,[170]
                          which was frozen until November 1.[171] In the afternoon of October 27, Musk and Twitter closed the
                          deal, with Musk tweeting "the bird is freed". Musk immediately became Twitter's new owner, promptly
                          firing Agrawal, chief financial officer (CFO) Ned Segal, Gadde, and general counsel Sean
                          Edgett,[172][173][174] with the executives escorted out of the company's headquarters by security.

                          Over the next several hours, Scheffler, 25, rebuffed every challenge with the same aplomb to claim
                          his first major championship, running away to win the 2022 Masters by three strokes. His margin of
                          victory would have been larger but for a final show of some nerves during the tournament’s closing
                          sequence on the 18th green, when Scheffler needed four putts, including three from less than five
                          feet, to close out a round of 71. Scheffler finished 10 under par for the tournament, in just his
                          third Masters appearance. Rory McIlroy, who trailed Scheffler by 10 strokes heading into the final
                          round, finished second after an eight-under-par 64. Smith and Shane Lowry tied for third, five
                          strokes off the lead. Speaking with reporters after donning the ceremonial green jacket awarded to
                          Masters winners, Scheffler talked of feeling calm on the course during the final round but said he
                          was “so stressed out” on Sunday morning. “I cried like a baby,” he said. “I was so overwhelmed.”
                          Scheffler added that he told his wife, Meredith, “I don’t think I’m ready for this.” Scheffler said
                          he could not recall any previous episodes of self-doubt and attributed it to an understanding of
                          how much winning the Masters would mean to him. “I’ve felt at peace on the golf course,” he said,
                          laughing.

                          powerful foe sail long. That was that. The championship belonged to Sabalenka via a 4-6, 6-3, 6-4
                          comeback victory over Wimbledon winner Rybakina. “The last game, yeah, of course, I was a little
                          bit nervous. I (kept) telling myself, like, ’Nobody tells you that it’s going to be easy.’ You just
                          have to work for it, work for it, ’til the last point,” said Sabalenka, a 24-year-old from Belarus
                          who is now 11-0 with two titles in 2023 and will rise to No. 2 in the WTA rankings on Monday. “I’m
                          super happy that I was able to handle all those emotions,” she said, “and win this one.” The only
                          set she has dropped all season was the opener on Saturday against Rybakina, who eliminated No.

                          American Chris Evert is the most successful woman at the tournament, with seven titles to her name.
                          Americans have historically dominated the event, seeing a champion crowned 15 times — 10 more than
                          next-best Australia. Monica Seles is the youngest player to win the French Open, capturing the
                          crown at the age of 16 years and six months in 1990. Seles beat all-time great Steffi Graf in
                          straight sets and would go on to win the next two editions of the tournament. At the other end of
                          the age spectrum, Rafael Nadal became the oldest player to become French Open champion in 2022,
                          turning 36 two days before the men's final on June 5. Andres Gimeno had previously been the oldest
                          French Open champion, winning in 1972 at the age of 34 years and 10 months. That was Gimeno's only
                          grand slam win, although he also reached the Australian Open final in 1969, losing to Rod Laver.
                          Gimeno remains tennis' oldest first-time major champion.

                          Gauff, an 18-year-old from Delray Beach, Florida, was disappointed after the loss, but talked about
                          how this match -- and her run to the final -- has helped boost her confidence. "For a while I
                          really believed I couldn't do it just because ever since I was 15 and I first came on people had so
                          much expectations for me and I started to believe that I couldn't do it and you know I made a final
                          and I wasn't expecting it and I know that I'll get this opportunity again and I hope that I can
                          come out on top next time. The numbers tell the story of a dominant and composed match for Swiatek
                          -- which was the story of her tournament and could be the tag line for her last three months of
                          tennis. 73% first serves in, 72% win rate on first serves, 5-for-10 in break point chances, just 16
                          unforced errors. On the other side of the court Gauff struggled on her first serve, winning just
                          46% of her first serve points and coming away with three double faults and 23 unforced errors and
                          21 forced errors. The next big tournament on the tennis calendar is Wimbledon, which starts June
                          27. Ash Barty, who retired earlier this year, won the women's singles in 2021.

                          Defending champion Iga Świątek[1] defeated Karolína Muchová in the final, 6–2, 5–7, 6–4 to win the
                          women's singles tennis title at the 2023 French Open. It was her third French Open title and fourth
                          major title overall.[2] Świątek became the third woman in the Open Era (after Monica Seles and
                          Naomi Osaka) to win her first four major finals, and the youngest woman to win four majors since
                          Serena Williams in 2002.[3] Świątek also became the first player to defend the French Open title
                          since Justine Henin in 2007, and the first woman to defend a major title since Serena Williams at
                          the 2016 Wimbledon Championships. Świątek dropped just one set en route to the title, to Muchová in
                          the final. Świątek retained the world No. 1 ranking after she reached the final and Aryna Sabalenka
                          lost in the semifinals.[4][5][6] 12 of the 32 seeds reached the third round, the fewest since the
                          French Open's draw was increased to 32 seeds in 2002.[7] Elina Avanesyan became the first lucky
                          loser to reach the fourth round since Nicole Jagerman in 1988, and the first at any major since
                          María José Gaidano at the 1993 US Open.[8]

                          defeated No. 3 seed Ons Jabeur on Saturday in London to claim the Wimbledon women’s singles title.
                          Rybakina came back from a first set loss to win in three sets and claim her first career Grand Slam
                          title. She claims a £2 million first place prize. Jabeur wins £1,050,000 as the runner-up.
                          Rybakina’s previous Wimbledon best performance was reaching last year’s fourth round. Her previous
                          Grand Slam best was a quarterfinals appearance at the 2021 French Open. Jabeur entered the match as
                          a -155 favorite at DraftKings Sportsbook and she cruised through the first set, winning 6-3.
                          However, Rybakina quickly turned things around. She rolled over Jabeur 6-2 in the second set and
                          then won the third set 6-2. The key point in the third set came in the sixth game. Rybakina led the
                          set 3-2 and was serving to go up 4-2, but Jabeur led 40-0 and had three break points. However,
                          Rybakina fought back to claim the game. She broke Jabeur to go up 5-2 and then served out for the
                          championship. Here’s a look at Elena Rybakina’s run to the championship.

                          England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club in Wimbledon, London, United Kingdom. Novak Djokovic
                          successfully defended his gentlemen's singles title to claim his 21st major title, defeating Nick
                          Kyrgios in the final.[1][2] Ashleigh Barty was the reigning ladies' champion, but did not defend
                          her title after retiring from professional tennis in March 2022.[3] The ladies' singles title was
                          won by Elena Rybakina, who defeated Ons Jabeur in the final.[4] This year, the AELTC barred Russian
                          and Belarusian players from competing because of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In reaction, the
                          WTA, ATP, and ITF withdrew ranking points from the tournament. The tournament was played on grass

                          Wimbledon from 27 June to 10 July 2022. Initial wild card entries were first announced on 14 June
                          2022.[5] Qualifying matches were played from 20 June to 23 June 2022 at the Bank of England Sports
                          Ground in Roehampton.[citation needed] The 2022 championships were the 135th edition, the 128th
                          staging of the ladies’ singles championship event, the 54th in the Open Era, and the third Grand

                          obviously, you never like to lose matches like this. But when all the emotions are settled I have

                          Murray - to win the Wimbledon men's single title since 2002, when Alcaraz wasn't even born. It is
                          his second grand slam title after winning the US Open in 2022. The last time 36-year-old Djokovic
                          lost on centre court, in 2013 to Andy Murray, Carlos was still in primary school. Share what you

                          for this special Open by writing last month that likely it would be her last. New York responded as
                          only New York could, feting her with video tributes by Queen Latifah and Oprah Winfrey. The big
                          screens around Arthur Ashe stadium projected a steady stream of famous faces who came to pay their
                          respects. And, admit it famous faces, to be seen, right?

                          Norway's Casper Ruud in four sets to win the men's singles final at the U.S. Open, his first
                          tournament win at Flushing-Meadows. Alcaraz, 19, is the first male teenager to win a Grand Slam
                          since Rafael Nadal won the French Open in 2005. Alcaraz will now take over as world No. 1, becoming
                          the youngest player to ever be the world's top-ranked player. Alcaraz took the first set but lost
                          the second to Ruud, the No. 5 seed. Ruud led 6-5 in a marathon third set that lasted more than 70
                          minutes and ended with Alcaraz tying it up after a dramatic 15-minute game. Alcaraz then easily
                          took the tiebreaker 7-1. Alcaraz won the fourth and final set 6-3. Alcaraz won the quarter-final
                          round in five sets against American Frances Tiafoe, who had defeated Rafael Nadal. He was serenaded
                          by choruses of "Olé, Olé, Olé! Carlos!" that reverberated off the closed roof at Arthur Ashe
                          Stadium — and Alcaraz often motioned to the supportive spectators to get louder.

  - Source              :
                          The starting point was the 2007-2010 recruiting runs that couldn’t net a replacement for Tyrod
                          Taylor behind center. There were flashes of good but the best post-Taylor Quarterback, Michael
                          Brewer was handicapped by injury, and a team in decline as the running game evaporated, and the
                          offensive line recruiting dropped to piecemeal replacements. Suffice it to say by the late Beamer
                          Era the team was sliding downhill rapidly. Whit Babcock, in a move that didn’t shock anyone after
                          his basketball coaching coup (of the time) with the Buzz hire, went out and found the best
                          available head coach by media and analyst agreement in Justin Fuente. We know how that turned out…
                          a brilliant 2 season flash followed by a fading ember and a huge bill for the displeasure of having
                          to part company with a failed regime. Face it, as reported third coaching choice Brent Pry signed
                          his contract to take over as head coach, the Virginia Tech Hokie football program was all show and
                          no go. Regardless of the level of Pry’s enthusiasm he was taking on a leaking hulk with a great
                          paintjob. The indications are that he knew and understood that challenge. The Hokies just haven’t
                          been very good for over a decade and getting over that slump was just not going to be a very easy
                          task, especially for a program that can only generate revenues well below even modest programs.

                          The 2022 Kentucky Derby (officially, the 148th Running of the Kentucky Derby Presented by Woodford
                          Reserve[1]) took place on Saturday, May 7, 2022, at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky. It was
                          the 148th running of the Kentucky Derby, a 1+1⁄4 miles (2.0 km) Grade I stakes race for
                          three-year-old Thoroughbreds. The Derby is held annually at Churchill Downs on the first Saturday
                          in May since its inception in 1875. The 20 horses that ran in the Derby qualified by earning points
                          in the 2022 Road to the Kentucky Derby. The two favorites for the 2022 Kentucky Derby were
                          Epicenter, the winner of the Louisiana Derby, and Zandon, the winner of the Blue Grass Stakes. Both
                          horses finished behind winner Rich Strike, who had only entered the race after a late scratch.
                          Entering the race at odds of 80–1, Rich Strike's victory was the second-largest upset in Derby
                          history. It was the first Kentucky Derby victory for his trainer Eric Reed, as well as the first
                          graded stakes win in any race for his jockey Sonny Leon. Participation in the Kentucky Derby is
                          restricted to three-year-old Thoroughbreds.

                          The 148th running of the Kentucky Derby will take place Saturday at Churchill Downs in Louisville,
                          Kentucky. Zandon, leaving from the 10 post, opened as the 3-1 morning-line favorite after Derby
                          post positions were released Monday, followed closely by Epicenter at 7-2 from the third position.
                          Post time for Saturday's one and one-quarter mile race is 6:57 p.m. ET. In last year's edition of
                          the Run for the Roses, Medina Spirit crossed the finish line first, which appeared to have given
                          trainer Bob Baffert a record seventh win in the race and jockey John Velazquez his fourth Derby

                          The 148th running of the Kentucky Derby will take place Saturday at Churchill Downs in Louisville,
                          Kentucky. Zandon, leaving from the 10 post, opened as the 3-1 morning-line favorite after Derby
                          post positions were released Monday, followed closely by Epicenter at 7-2 from the third position.
                          Post time for Saturday's one and one-quarter mile race is 6:57 p.m. ET. In last year's edition of
                          the Run for the Roses, Medina Spirit crossed the finish line first, which appeared to have given
                          trainer Bob Baffert a record seventh win in the race and jockey John Velazquez his fourth Derby
                          win. However, the horse tested positive for a banned race-day substance and the Kentucky Horse
                          Racing Commission stripped Medina Spirit of his Derby title in February. With Medina Spirit's win
                          vacated, second-place finisher Mandaloun improved to first place. Here are the morning-line odds
                          for the 2022 Kentucky Derby, in order of post position (with trainer and jockey): Trainer: Todd

                          The initial months of 2021 were not favorable for automakers. Semiconductor shortages derailed the
                          post-COVID recovery, affecting vehicle sales worldwide. But the shortages have eased a bit one year
                          later and auto sales are reviving. Automakers expect to recover the losses made during the last two
                          years, soon. However, traditional automakers are unable to cope with the rising demand for pure
                          EVs, whereas Tesla’s ability to address this demand has rewarded it not only with higher vehicle
                          sales in Q1 2022 but also a record revenue of $18.8 billion. Tesla has also started deliveries to
                          car rental service provider Hertz against its huge 100,000-vehicle order, which is also a reason
                          for high vehicle production and delivery during the quarter. Tesla’s Q1 2022 revenue would have
                          been more without the fresh COVID wave that has hit Shanghai and surrounding areas, affecting the
                          company’s production there. From the second week of March, rising cases of a new COVID variant have
                          forced automakers operating around Shanghai to suspend production. The urge to achieve L4 autonomy
                          by the end of 2023 and to roll out robotaxis by early 2025 can be a major reason for Tesla’s big
                          R&D spend. Besides, Tesla could also be conducting research on developing new battery chemistry.
                          The soaring prices of some key battery components like nickel and lithium have put the auto OEMs in
                          a spot.

Question 73              : Who acquired STX Entertainment?

  - Source              :
                          By Anthony D'Alessandro Editorial Director/Box Office Editor EXCLUSIVE: There’s been a lot of
                          biting rumors around STX Entertainment during the past four months, from a potential sale to
                          Lionsgate to possibly filing Chapter 11. These are not coming to realization as the Hustlers and
                          Bad Moms studio now can breathe a sigh of relief, having fully closed its sale to The Najafi
                          Companies, with Birch Grove LP and 777 Partners now also providing financing. The Forest Road
                          Company originally was part of the Najafi consortium in taking over STX’s debt, but it no longer is
                          part of the revived studio going forward. All of this puts STX Entertainment in a position to
                          remain independent, now completely separated from Eros International, which we’ve heard has had its
                          own financial baggage, further complicating affairs for the Burbank studio. All of this is good for
                          the greater independent film ecosphere as STX won’t be a theatrical distributor to bite the dust in
                          an industry still obsessed with streaming as the pandemic eases. Related Stories Corporate Affairs

  - Source              :
                          STX Entertainment is an American entertainment and media company. Founded in March 2014 by film
                          producer Robert Simonds, the studio produces film, television, and digital media projects. In April
                          2020, STX announced that it would merge with the Indian studio Eros International plc. The merger
                          was completed in July 2020, and STX became a division of ErosSTX. In December 2021, Jahm Najafi
                          announced his intention to acquire STX from the merged company for $173 million–a sale completed in
                          April 2022. Eros remains a minority, non-voting shareholder.[1] In 2012, Simonds and McGlashan
                          began work on conceptualizing a media company based on the idea of producing medium-budget projects
                          with a star attached, a method that had gone out of style with Hollywood studios. The conversation
                          led to the launch of STX Entertainment in 2014, with the mission to finance, develop, produce,
                          market, and distribute star-driven content around the world.[2][3] Investors in the company
                          included Hony Capital, Tencent, PCCW, TPG Growth, and Liberty Global. Individual investors include
                          Gigi Pritzker, Beau Wrigley, and Dominic Ng.[4][5][6] In September 2017, it was reported that STX
                          was considering an initial public offering on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (SEHK).

                          Orrin Grant Hatch (March 22, 1934 – April 23, 2022) was an American attorney and politician who
                          served as a United States senator from Utah from 1977 to 2019. Hatch's 42-year Senate tenure made
                          him the longest-serving Republican U.S. senator in history, overtaking Ted Stevens, until Chuck
                          Grassley surpassed him in 2023. Hatch chaired the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and
                          Pensions from 1981 to 1987. He served as chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee from 1995 to 2001
                          and 2003 to 2005. On January 3, 2015, after the 114th United States Congress was sworn in, he
                          became president pro tempore of the Senate. He was chair of the Senate Finance Committee from 2015
                          to 2019, and led efforts to pass the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Orrin Grant Hatch was born in
                          Homestead, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Pittsburgh.[1][2] He was the son of Jesse Hatch (1904–1992), a
                          metal lather,[3] and his wife Helen Frances Hatch (née Kamm; 1906–1995). Hatch had eight brothers
                          and sisters, two of whom died during infancy.[4] Hatch was profoundly affected by the loss of his
                          older brother Jesse, a U.S.

Question 75              : Who was the new CEO of CNN?
Correct Answers         :  
                          Chris Licht
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - Answer              : David Zaslav
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          Jump to Warner Bros. Discovery should not hire a new CEO for CNN. Chris Licht's exit from that role
                          gives WBD an opportunity to rethink what kind of leadership the organization really needs, and CEO
                          David Zaslav should grab it. You know who wasn't CEO of CNN? Jeff Zucker, the network's boss for
                          nine years. Zucker's title was president of CNN Worldwide. He was also chairman of WarnerMedia News
                          & Sports, but that's not the role he was known for. And while there are plenty of criticisms to
                          make of his tenure — the firehose coverage of Trump, ratings challenges, the undisclosed consensual
                          relationship with a colleague that precipitated his exit — Zucker was a strong, dynamic general who
                          held the hearts and minds of CNN's newsroom. Without a CEO title. Insider recently published an org
                          chart highlighting the most powerful executives at WBD — it reveals that there are nine people with
                          a CEO title reporting to Zaslav. Nine. A CEO runs a company. WBD is a sprawling global
                          entertainment conglomerate with many complex divisions, but it is not a holding company with nine
                          subsidiaries each requiring its own chief executive. Zaslav is the chief executive of all of those
                          divisions, especially CNN, where he reportedly was very involved with day-to-day operations, even
                          though the network represents less than 10% of WBD revenue, The Wall Street Journal reported.

  - Source              :
                          The final death knell was a devastating 15,000-word profile in The Atlantic that published on
                          Friday. The blistering piece, in which author Tim Alberta spoke to more than 100 CNN employees,
                          called into serious question Licht’s ability to lead the organization into the future. In the wake
                          of The Atlantic article, Licht attempted to regain his footing. He apologized to staffers and vowed
                          to “fight like hell” to win over the trust of employees. But it became increasingly clear that
                          Licht’s tenure as the chief executive was not tenable and quickly coming to an end. High-profile
                          anchors and correspondents, in addition the the rank-and-file staff, had hit the wall with Licht.
                          The CNN chief had, in effect, lost the room. The picture quickly became clear to Zaslav, who
                          installed his top lieutenant, David Leavy, as CNN’s chief operating officer last week. Over the
                          weekend, after The Atlantic story crystallized concerns that Zaslav had with Licht’s leadership
                          over the last several months, the Warner Bros. Discovery chief started seriously considering
                          relieving him of his duties, a person familiar with the matter said. It had become evident that
                          Licht, suffering from a series of self-inflicted wounds, could no longer lead the company. The
                          final decision to remove Licht was ultimately made by Zaslav earlier this week, the person said.

                          My commitment is to foster an environment in which everyone can do their best work and feel
                          supported.” The top job at CNN suddenly opened up in early February when Jeff Zucker was forced out
                          by WarnerMedia. In his resignation note, he admitted to a consensual romantic relationship with his
                          longtime No. 2 Allison Gollust, which he had failed to disclose as required by corporate policy.
                          Gollust then resigned in mid-February. Both departures stemmed from an internal probe that started
                          when prime time anchor Chris Cuomo was fired last December. WarnerMedia said an investigation found
                          “violations of Company policies, including CNN’s News Standards and Practices, by Jeff Zucker,
                          Allison Gollust, and Chris Cuomo.” The company has not detailed the violations, and Gollust’s
                          representatives have defended her conduct. Since the shakeup, three veteran CNN executives have
                          been running the news network on an interim basis. Licht’s career path bears some similarities to
                          Zucker’s. Both men made a mark in morning television and gained respect from colleagues for news
                          judgments and programming acumen. With “CBS This Morning,” Licht created a two-hour telecast that
                          emphasized more hard news than its broadcast rivals. He was also recognized for his talent
                          management skills; anchors like Gayle King sang Licht’s praises. In 2016 Licht moved from news to
                          late-night when “The Late Show” needed a lift.

                          France must make its voice heard,” Macron said. During her campaign, Le Pen pledged to dilute
                          French ties with the 27-nation EU, NATO and Germany, moves that would have shaken Europe’s security
                          architecture as the continent deals with its worst conflict since World War II. Le Pen also spoke
                          against EU sanctions on Russian energy supplies and faced scrutiny during the campaign over her
                          previous friendliness with the Kremlin. A chorus of European leaders hailed Macron’s victory, since
                          France has played a leading role in international efforts to punish Russia with sanctions and is
                          supplying weapons to Ukraine. “Democracy wins, Europe wins,” said Spanish Prime Minister Pedro

                          Ursula von der Leyen. Italian Premier Mario Draghi called Macron’s victory “splendid news for all

                          starting with the war in Ukraine.” Macron won with 58.5% of the vote to Le Pen’s 41.5% —
                          significantly closer than when they first faced off in 2017. Macron is the first French president
                          in 20 years to win reelection, since incumbent Jacques Chirac trounced Le Pen’s father in 2002.

                          The iPhone 14 Pro's lens on the main rear camera also has a wider field of view than the 13 Pro's:
                          24mm versus 26mm. This means you can get a little more in your shot, which might be especially
                          helpful for landscape photography. The iPhone 14 Pro also has another trick up its sleeve: The
                          48-megapixel sensor can also take 12-megapixel shots at an effective 2x optical zoom. You'll see a
                          new 2x option in the camera interface. That crops the center of the higher-resolution image to
                          immediately give you more flexibility with focal length, without needing a fourth lens. The iPhone
                          13 Pro can also take photos at 2x zoom, but it uses digital zoom and doesn't have the same quality
                          or level of detail as this new technique. I find the new 2x option on the iPhone 14 Pro helps with
                          portrait mode. Instead of just offering 1x and 3x options like on the older phone, it can also snap
                          portrait mode photos at 2x. This results in more natural-looking shots to my eye. I find it's more
                          flattering on facial features than the wide look from 1x, or the zoomed-in perspective at 3x. The
                          iPhone 14 Pro has a new image processing pipeline to help improve medium to low-light shots.

                          The iPhone 14 Pro's lens on the main rear camera also has a wider field of view than the 13 Pro's:
                          24mm versus 26mm. This means you can get a little more in your shot, which might be especially
                          helpful for landscape photography. The iPhone 14 Pro also has another trick up its sleeve: The
                          48-megapixel sensor can also take 12-megapixel shots at an effective 2x optical zoom. You'll see a
                          new 2x option in the camera interface. That crops the center of the higher-resolution image to
                          immediately give you more flexibility with focal length, without needing a fourth lens. The iPhone
                          13 Pro can also take photos at 2x zoom, but it uses digital zoom and doesn't have the same quality
                          or level of detail as this new technique. I find the new 2x option on the iPhone 14 Pro helps with
                          portrait mode. Instead of just offering 1x and 3x options like on the older phone, it can also snap
                          portrait mode photos at 2x. This results in more natural-looking shots to my eye. I find it's more
                          flattering on facial features than the wide look from 1x, or the zoomed-in perspective at 3x. The
                          iPhone 14 Pro has a new image processing pipeline to help improve medium to low-light shots.

                          It’s definitely not tailored to the average fixer, but we’ve been asking for this for almost 20
                          years—iFixit was basically created out of frustration with Apple’s lack of repair manuals. So this
                          is a huge step forward: better late than never! Shahram: It may be better than nothing but not by
                          much, we’ve got no board-level schematics and it’d be nice to get more than a few super recent
                          iPhones. Sam: I really think that this massive company is overcoming a lot of inertia and a very
                          nervous legal department. Apple has already promised that M1 Mac support is coming this year. We
                          can only hope the environmental teams can prove to the lawyers that yes, repair is possible and
                          good. And if that doesn’t work, there’s always the Right to Repair! Shahram: Let’s have a look at
                          spare parts. Aside from the very limited number of devices and limited types of parts available,
                          the parts are crazy expensive; $329 for an in-store repair where Apple does everything vs $278.35
                          for a DIY repair, after you give them your old screen, and IF you don’t rent their tools—which by
                          the way if you did would bring the total DIY cost to $327.35. And what about our friend Jessa who

                          In the first round of the playoffs, the Celtics won in a four-game sweep over the seventh-seeded
                          Brooklyn Nets, with numerous experts expecting a more competitive series as the Nets, with Kevin
                          Durant, Kyrie Irving and initially James Harden before he was traded to the Philadelphia 76ers,
                          were seen as the preseason favorites.[11] The Celtics then faced the 2021 Finals MVP Giannis
                          Antetokounmpo and defending champion Milwaukee Bucks, going down 3–2 in the series before
                          eventually winning the series in seven games. After going down 2–1 in the conference finals against
                          the first-seeded Miami Heat led by Jimmy Butler, the Celtics won in seven games, reaching the
                          Finals for the first time since 2010 and for the 22nd time in their history.[12] This marked the
                          first time a team from the Greater Boston area reached a championship series of the four major
                          North American sports leagues since 2019, when the Boston Bruins reached the Stanley Cup Finals.
                          After reaching the Finals for five consecutive seasons (2015–2019), the Warriors were struck with
                          injuries for the next two seasons, with Klay Thompson sitting out for the entire 2019–20 and
                          2020–21 campaigns, and Stephen Curry playing a combined 68 games during that time span.[13] In
                          2021–22, Golden State began the season winning 18 of their first 20 games.

                          When news of the reality competition spin-off was announced last week, some on social media pointed
                          out the irony of such a competition show. “The game is intended to represent the commodification of
                          suffering by privileged people, and how watching people struggle for money and their lives is seen
                          as entertainment for people who will never have to experience such things,” said Mika Winder, 16,
                          of Oregon. “Making a real life version goes against the entire message of the original show in an
                          almost comical way." Others echoed similar sentiments on social media, including one person who

                          were not revealed in Netflix's press release or the show's casting application. For some fans of
                          "Squid Game," like Dracy Peters, the reality competition series is an opportunity to "have fun."
                          Peters, 23, of Louisiana, said he's applying to be a contestant to put his knowledge of the games
                          to the test. “The show is a work of fiction with an elaborate plot, where the characters had to
                          risk their lives for the money,” Peters said.

                          Netflix is recruiting participants for a reality TV show inspired by its most popular series of all
                          time, Squid Game. However, it will not be life or death that is at stake, as depicted in the South
                          Korean dystopian drama. Instead, 456 recruits from around the world will play games where "the
                          worst fate is going home empty-handed" - missing out on a $4.56m (£3.8m) prize. Netflix also
                          confirmed that the popular series would be renewed for a second season earlier this week. On
                          Wednesday, the platform announced that its new 10-episode series - Squid Game: The Challenge -
                          would offer the "largest cast and lump cash prize in reality TV history". "As [players] compete
                          through a series of games inspired by the original show - plus surprising new additions - their
                          strategies, alliances, and character will be put to the test while competitors are eliminated
                          around them," it added. Participants need to be at least 21 years old. They must speak English, and
                          be available for up to 4 weeks in early 2023 for filming. The 456 participants are a nod to the
                          fictional series, which features the same number of players, with its main protagonist Seong Gi-hun
                          also referred to as Player 456. The South Korean thriller series tells the story of debt-ridden
                          people competing for a huge cash prize in a deadly series of children's games.

                          Pogačar remains the best all-around rider in the world, and with a little more tactical nous–and
                          perhaps a bit more humility–he might get even better. Who Really Won the Tour? While
                          INEOS-Grenadiers finished the Tour atop the Team’s Classification, Jumbo-Visma was the best team in
                          the 2022 Tour de France. In addition to winning the yellow jersey, Vingegaard also won the polka
                          dot jersey as the winner of the Tour’s King of the Mountains competition. His teammate, Belgium’s
                          Wout van Aert, won the green jersey as the winner of the Tour’s Points Classification and was also
                          named the Tour’s Most Aggressive Rider. Along the way the team won six stages: three with van Aert,
                          two with Vingegaard, and one with France’s Cristophe Laporte. Perhaps even more impressive was the
                          manner in which the team defended Vingegaard’s lead in the Pyrenees during the Tour’s third week.
                          The team lost Slovenia’s Primož Roglič and the Netherlands’ Steven Kruijswijk on Stage 15, with
                          Roglič not taking the start and Kruijswijk crashing out on the road to Carcassonne.

Question 85              : How much was Apple's revenue in Q3? 2022
Correct Answers         :  
                          83 billion, 83.0 billion

                          Apple today officially reported its earnings for the third fiscal quarter of 2022, covering the
                          second calendar quarter and the months of April, May, and June. A lot of eyes are on Apple as
                          concerns mount over an economic downturn in the United States. Here’s what the company reported
                          today. For Q3 2022, Apple reported revenue of $83.0 billion and a profit of $19.4 billion.
                          Earnings-per-share hit $1.20 for the quarter. For Q3 2022, analyst predictions for revenue varied;
                          $79.26B at the low end to $88.41B at the high end. The average across 26 analysts, however, was
                          $82.81 billion. Apple had not provided any guidance for Q3 2022, citing ongoing supply chain issues
                          and continued disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, the company had even warned
                          that supply constraints would cost it somewhere in the range of $4 billion to $8 billion in revenue
                          for the quarter. For comparison’s sake, in the same quarter a year ago, Apple reported $81.43
                          billion in revenue and profit of $21.74 billion. It reported earnings-per-share of $1.30. These
                          numbers were boosted heavily by pandemic-induced spending, driven by strong iPad and Mac revenue
                          growth. Apple no longer reports unit sales for any of its products but instead reports a breakdown
                          of revenue by product category.

                          ATLANTA, Ga. – It took an hour and 12 minutes for Georgia Tech’s Andres Martin to defeat No. 69
                          Thanasi Kokkinakis in straight sets, 6-3, 6-2, in the first round of the 2022 Atlanta Open on
                          Tuesday during College Night. Kokkinakis, who captured his first ATP Tour title earlier this year,
                          and Martin stood on serve in the opening set before the Jacket earned a break to go up, 4-2. Martin
                          held serve in the next game, fighting off two break points, to claim a 5-2 edge against the
                          Australian native. The Yellow Jacket closed out the opening set, 6-3, to take a set lead over
                          Kokkinakis, who was making his first appearance since Wimbledon. On serve at 2-all in the second
                          set, Martin broke Kokkinakis to go up 3-2 and never looked back. Serving at 1-2, Martin won the
                          next five games to seal the victory and secure a place in the second round. “Once I found out I was
                          playing him [Kokkinakis], I created a game plan and I just stuck to it as hard as I could,” said
                          Martin. “I focused on what I could control and it ended up working out for me. “I just focused on
                          what we had been working on this whole summer, getting better little by little,” Martin commented.

  - Answer              : Sallie Gardner
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          As Emerald recounts early in the film, the very first moving picture was created from photos of a
                          man galloping on a horse, specifically a Black jockey whose name has been lost to — or erased from
                          — history, depending on your perspective. The horse was named Sallie Gardner. Horses have had a
                          long and rocky history in Hollywood. Early Hollywood films put horses through gruelling working
                          conditions, often resulting in injury or death. They were essentially treated as disposable. Now
                          on-set animal action, in the United States at least, is monitored by the nonprofit American Humane.
                          Plus, animals on screen are increasingly computer-generated images or motion capture marvels that
                          fuse digital imagery with human actors, as was the case in the award-winning rebooted Planet of the
                          Apes trilogy starring Andy Serkis as the lead chimpanzee, Caesar. We have both reformed and
                          replaced animals’ work in the making of entertainment. Horses and chimpanzees are now often placed
                          on opposite sides of a perceived line between accepted and unacceptable animal use. Most horses are
                          domesticated and have worked for humans for thousands of years. Their careers, reproduction and
                          social lives are largely controlled by humans. In contrast, although individual chimpanzees have
                          been held captive, their species remains wild.

Question 91              : Who is the lead actor in the film Carter?
Correct Answers         :  
                          Joo Won
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prediction (only positive):
  - Answer              : Joo Won as Carter Lee
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          Here's a guide to that cast and characters they play in Carter, and what they've been in before.
                          Heading up the cast is Joo Won as Carter Lee, later revealed as also going by the name Michael
                          Bane. The film begins with Carter waking up in a blood-soaked bed in Seoul with a cross-shaped scar
                          on the back of his head and no memory of who he is. With a premise similar to Hardcore Henry,
                          Carter also features video game logic in its action sequences. Joo Won is a South Korean actor best
                          known for his roles in television, including the main protagonist in Good Doctor, which is played
                          by Freddie Highmore in the American adaptation. Kim Jong-hyeok is a North Korean General who meets
                          Carter during his mission, providing him transport out of South Korea. General Kim is played by Lee
                          Sung-jae, a veteran South Korean actor with credits in TV and film. Lee’s most notable credit is
                          Barking Dogs Never Bite, a 2000 dark comedy film that was the directorial debut of Bong Joon-ho,
                          whose film Parasite won the 2020 Oscar for Best Picture. The young girl cured of the virus and
                          carrying the life-saving antibodies is Jung Ha-na (Kim Bo-min). Carter is tasked with rescuing
                          Ha-na and bringing her to a North Korean facility where the production of a vaccine can be
                          developed.

                          spewing marginally racist comments. The third iteration of Meta’s AI chatbot Blender Bot and the

                          week after its launch, Meta’s Blender Bot 3 has turned on its creator and is already spewing
                          marginally racist comments. Blender Bot 3 was released by the social networking giant on Friday,
                          August 5. The conversational AI is designed to converse with humans about “nearly any topic.” Like
                          Blender Bot 2, the latest upgrade also features the ability to browse the internet, is trained on
                          the OPT-175B language model (which is 58x the size of Blender Bot 2), and has long-term memory. It
                          also eliminates the limitations such as forgetfulness (which surprisingly makes machine learning
                          models efficient when not used in chatbots). It has self-learning capabilities that allow it “to
                          improve its conversational skills and safety through feedback from people who chat with it,
                          focusing on helpful feedback while avoiding learning from unhelpful or dangerous responses.” Well,
                          yes and no. While it is entirely plausible that the underlying AI tech helps it to ‘learn,’ it
                          seems like Blender Bot 3 cannot differentiate between what is acceptable and what is not. At least
                          that’s what its recent responses to some people conveyed.

                          Meta's new prototype chatbot has told the BBC that Mark Zuckerberg exploits its users for money.
                          Meta says the chatbot uses artificial intelligence and can chat on "nearly any topic". Asked what
                          the chatbot thought of the company's CEO and founder, it replied "our country is divided and he
                          didn't help that at all". Meta said the chatbot was a prototype and might produce rude or offensive
                          answers. "Everyone who uses Blender Bot is required to acknowledge they understand it's for
                          research and entertainment purposes only, that it can make untrue or offensive statements, and that
                          they agree to not intentionally trigger the bot to make offensive statements," said a Meta
                          spokesperson. The chatbot, called BlenderBot 3, was released to the public on Friday. The programme
                          "learns" from large amounts of publicly available language data. When asked about Mark Zuckerberg,
                          the chatbot told the BBC: "He did a terrible job at testifying before congress. It makes me
                          concerned about our country." Mr Zuckerberg has been questioned several times by US politicians,
                          most notably in 2018. "Our country is divided, and he didn't help with that at all," the chatbot
                          continued. "His company exploits people for money and he doesn't care. It needs to stop!" it said.
                          Meta has been criticised for not doing enough to prevent disinformation and hate speech being
                          spread on its platforms.

                          November 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use. Both the free version of ChatGPT and
                          the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model is GPT-4.
                          There is a free version of ChatGPT that only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version,
                          ChatGPT Plus. Anyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies and search engines are utilizing
                          the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questions/concerns. Multiple enterprises
                          utilize ChatGPT, although others may limit the use of the AI-powered tool. Most recently, Microsoft
                          announced at it’s 2023 Build conference that it is integrating it ChatGPT-based Bing experience
                          into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startup Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT to produce

                          Rich visuals mean pictures for now, but later can include maps, charts and other items. ChatGPT’s
                          generative AI has had a longer lifespan and thus has been “learning” for a longer period of time

                          necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the
                          sense that they’ll give canned responses to questions. ChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM
                          technology to generate text after a prompt. Yes. Due to the nature of how these models work, they
                          don’t know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That’s a problem when you’re
                          using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn’t commit, that may
                          well at this point be libel. We will see how handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT will
                          play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving

                          ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations

                          well-known model based on GPT that OpenAI fine-tuned for a chatbot experience). Open AI’s GPT-4
                          Technical Report states that GPT-4 demonstrates substantial improvements in performance and

                          version is not available just yet, but you can sign up for the OpenAI waitlist or subscribe to Chat
                          GPT Plus to gain access to the bot. GPT-4 was officially released this week. OpenAI has confirmed
                          the new model in a news post on its website. At the moment, the model is only available via Chat
                          GPT for Chat GPT Plus members. Although, if you are hoping to use the model for free, GPT-4 will
                          also come available on the OpenAI Playground in the next coming weeks.

                          WeChat On March 14, 2023, OpenAI—a MoFo client—released GPT-4, which quickly garnered broad media
                          coverage. For those assessing the opportunities and risks related to GPT-4, it is useful to
                          consider the extent of the stated technical and safety improvements and the limitations of the
                          release. GPT-4 is the newest version of OpenAI’s Generative Pre-trained Transformer model. Like
                          previous versions of GPT, GPT-4 is a transformer-based large language model that is pre-trained
                          using both publicly available data (such as internet data) and third-party licensed data to
                          generate text output based on input prompts. GPT is the foundation model behind ChatGPT (the
                          well-known model based on GPT that OpenAI fine-tuned for a chatbot experience). Open AI’s GPT-4
                          Technical Report states that GPT-4 demonstrates substantial improvements in performance and
                          capabilities from GPT-3.5, including the ability to: Regarding hallucinations, GPT-4 scored 19%

                          By Susan Bradley, Contributing Writer, Computerworld | Windows 11 22H2, released two weeks ago, is
                          another step closer to being an acceptable upgrade to Windows 10. But many Windows users aren't yet
                          being offered it for download. It's important to understand that we're in the “seeker” era for
                          Windows 11 22H2. Microsoft still has a variety of hardware and third-party issues to work through,
                          which is why you might not get offered 22H2 right away. But there is a mechanism you can use to
                          review any hard blocks on your system. (If you want to get 22H2 sooner rather than later, you could
                          opt into the Insider release track, which ensures you get the beta versions of Windows 11 — but
                          that also exposes your hardware to possible bugs, side effects, and other issues.) Courtesy of Adam
                          Gross, you can use a GitHub script to determine exactly why your system is not being offered 22H2.
                          You can either download the PowerShell script from the Github site or follow these commands to
                          determine what might be blocking Windows 11 22H@ from showing up on your hardware.. First, search
                          for PowerShell and then right-mouse click and run as administrator. In an administrator PowerShell
                          session, type in the following: Install-Module FU.

                          on Sept. 27. Here’s how fast the Ryzen 7000 family will be, and how much the Ryzen 7000 chips will
                          cost: These chips do not have an integrated graphics core, but they do contain some very basic
                          “GPU-like” functions for driving the display. (If AMD still plans full-fledged “APUs” with
                          integrated graphics, they’ll come later.) AMD Su ascribed the performance improvements in part to
                          the move to a 5nm process node, but also a new front-end architecture and support for AVX-512, a
                          set of instructions used for high-performance computing that Intel adopted in 2020. AVX-512 hasn’t
                          been a hit with some users such as Linux creator Linux Torvalds, who wrote that he hoped it would
                          die a “painful death.” But what are those performance improvements? As every chip manufacturer
                          does, AMD picked a few benchmarks to show the new Ryzen 7000 processors in a favorable light. But
                          it also aggregated them together, demonstrating that, across the board, the Ryzen 7000 handily
                          outperforms its own Ryzen 5000 processors as well as the rival Alder Lake. And not just a

                          Championships. According to ESPN, Konnor McClain delivered a strong two-day performance to win
                          all-around gold at the national championships. She was joined on the podium by silver medalist

                          are all Black. It was a very tight competition that saw first place and third place separated by
                          only eight-tenths of a point. McClain was expected to be a part of the 2020 Olympic team, but a
                          rough season combined with injuries led her to abruptly switch coaches—which is a decision not
                          normally made during an Olympic cycle. Now, a year later, that change has clearly paid off. The bad
                          news for the rest of the world is that the champion says she’s only at 75 percent, as she’s still
                          recovering from a recent concussion and is dealing with stress fractures in both shins. McClain
                          thinks she’ll be completely ready for the world championships later this year in England. “Anything
                          can happen,’’ she said. “So I’m excited for the future.’’ After the first day of competition,
                          McClain was a close second behind Jones, but a strong opening vault put her ahead of Jones, who
                          fell off the balance beam. Though the gold medalist stayed in front the rest of the night, things
                          ultimately came down to the final rotation.

                          gold medalist Suni Lee, who plans to return to elite competition next year. And perhaps Biles, who

                          the world championships this fall. That five-woman team will be named after an October selection
                          camp and will be favored for gold given the absence of Olympic champion Russia, whose athletes are

Question 101              : What is the new price of Tesla's Full-Self Driving (FSD) software?

                          Keiron Berndt | Capital One Article QuickTakes: Tesla has raised the price of its Full Self-Driving
                          (FSD) feature set again, this time to $15,000. The increase follows several others, including one
                          just months ago, when the cost rose from $10,000 to $12,000. This latest hike is tied to a software
                          update (FSD Beta 10.69.2), which improves overall driving smoothness through turns, enhances
                          pedestrian and animal detection, and enables a creep-into-intersection function. Full Self-Driving
                          is Tesla’s disingenuously named suite of advanced driver-assistance features. Currently, it
                          includes all the functionality of Basic and Enhanced Autopilot, plus the ability to slow the
                          vehicle to a stop as it approaches red traffic signals and signs. If you see little importance or
                          utility in the last of those things, you can still get the bulk of Tesla’s magic with Enhanced
                          Autopilot. It costs a relative bargain, at $6,000, and gives your vehicle the ability to park
                          itself and navigate a highway route from on-ramp to off-ramp (including automatic lane changes)
                          with minimal driver involvement. It also includes Summon, which allows the driver to direct a car
                          into or out of a tight parking space while standing outside the vehicle, and Smart Summon, which
                          enables the vehicle to wind its way around objects (such as in a parking lot) to meet the driver.

                          House of the Dragon is an American fantasy drama television series created by George R. R. Martin
                          and Ryan Condal for HBO. A prequel to Game of Thrones (2011–2019), it is the second television
                          series in the A Song of Ice and Fire franchise. Condal and Miguel Sapochnik served as the
                          showrunners for the first season. Based on parts of Martin's 2018 book Fire & Blood, the series
                          begins about 100 years after the Seven Kingdoms are united by the Targaryen Conquest, nearly 200
                          years before the events of Game of Thrones, and 172 years before the birth of Daenerys Targaryen.
                          Featuring an ensemble cast, the show portrays the events leading up to the beginning of the decline
                          of House Targaryen, a devastating war of succession known as the "Dance of the Dragons". House of
                          the Dragon received a straight-to-series order in October 2019, with casting beginning in July 2020
                          and principal photography starting in April 2021 in the United Kingdom. The series premiered on
                          August 21, 2022, with the first season consisting of ten episodes. Five days after its premiere,
                          the series was renewed for a second season. Sapochnik departed as showrunner after the first
                          season, leaving Condal to serve as the sole showrunner for the second season.

                          House of the Dragon is an American fantasy drama television series created by George R. R. Martin
                          and Ryan Condal for HBO. A prequel to Game of Thrones (2011–2019), it is the second television
                          series in the A Song of Ice and Fire franchise. Condal and Miguel Sapochnik served as the
                          showrunners for the first season. Based on parts of Martin's 2018 book Fire & Blood, the series
                          begins about 100 years after the Seven Kingdoms are united by the Targaryen Conquest, nearly 200
                          years before the events of Game of Thrones, and 172 years before the birth of Daenerys Targaryen.
                          Featuring an ensemble cast, the show portrays the events leading up to the beginning of the decline
                          of House Targaryen, a devastating war of succession known as the "Dance of the Dragons". House of
                          the Dragon received a straight-to-series order in October 2019, with casting beginning in July 2020
                          and principal photography starting in April 2021 in the United Kingdom. The series premiered on
                          August 21, 2022, with the first season consisting of ten episodes. Five days after its premiere,
                          the series was renewed for a second season. Sapochnik departed as showrunner after the first
                          season, leaving Condal to serve as the sole showrunner for the second season.

                          [Warning: The following contains MAJOR spoilers for The Amazing Race Season 34 premiere, “Many
                          Firsts But Don’t Be Last.”] When you’re 30+ seasons into a show, you’ve got to change things up
                          from time to time. A big new change was revealed in The Amazing Race Season 34 premiere on
                          September 21 on CBS, and it raises the stakes of the fast-paced competition series to new heights.
                          In The Amazing Race Season 34, there will be no non-elimination rounds. If you’re last, you’re cut,
                          and you can’t be saved. The show announced this change ahead of the season premiere, but the
                          contestants had no clue. The paired players learned of this shocking update from host Phil Keoghan
                          outside of Nymphenburg Palace in Munich, Germany, marking another first — the series has always
                          started the seasons somewhere in the United States. Throughout their adventures, the cast will trek
                          through Jordan, Austria, Italy, France, Spain, and Iceland before arriving at the Nashville finish
                          line. Players hardly had any time to process the non-elimination bombshell before it was off to the
                          (many) races. The first leg of the race required players to drive themselves to three different
                          places before finding Phil at the first Pit Stop. This task went off relatively without a hitch for
                          the teams. The next challenge was more physically demanding, requiring contestants to roll a beer
                          keg (when in Germany) through obstacles in one minute.

                          They couldn’t move forward until they successfully got through all the obstacles in that short
                          timeframe. Military brothers Michael and Marcus made quick work of that, nailing it on the second
                          attempt, but others struggled more. Timing is everything in this game, so multiple failed challenge
                          attempts could snowball into eliminations. Up next, the pairs had to saw a log to unlock a clue.
                          The teams deployed different strategies for this. Where some exerted a lot of physical energy,
                          others took a less intense, more careful approach of letting the saw do what it’s made to do.
                          Preserving energy was a good move, as the last challenge required players to chisel through a large
                          block of ice. Kit Karzen/CBS Big Brother alums Derek and Claire (who have been dating since meeting
                          on the show) were the first couple to unlock all three clues, which reveal the next Pit Stop
                          location: Friedensengal, Munich’s Angel of Peace monument. Derek and Claire came in first place,
                          winning them $2,500 each. Newlyweds Glenda and Lumumba placed second, and former Rams cheerleaders
                          Quinton and Mattie placed third. Engaged couple Aastha and Nina came in last, making them the first
                          pair eliminated from The Amazing Race Season 34. The Amazing Race will have a 90-minute episode on
                          September 28, starting at 9:30/8:30c on CBS.

                          Barcelona also faces a ban that could stretch to multiple years if a match-fixing allegation
                          emerges in the so-called “Caso Negreira” case. Any club suspected of fixing just one game since a
                          UEFA rule took effect in 2007 is typically removed from the next European competition. A
                          disciplinary case also is opened that can apply further sanctions. Turkish club Fenerbahce ended up
                          missing three seasons because of fixing allegations in 2011. Milan and Toulouse, owned by RedBird
                          Capital Partners, are not alone facing UEFA questions about multi-club owners having “decisive
                          influence” over two clubs. Brighton and Union Saint-Gilloise have close ties through owner Tony
                          Bloom and both are in the Europa League. Aston Villa’s owners, including Milwaukee Bucks co-owner
                          Wes Edens, have a near-50% stake in Vitória Guimarães of Portugal. Both are in the Europa
                          Conference League. Still, those clubs can point to a celebrated ruling in 2017 when Leipzig and
                          Salzburg were able to persuade UEFA — amid broad skepticism — that energy drinks giant Red Bull did
                          not control both clubs. Any club’s ban opens the door for others to be included. Fifth-place La
                          Liga team Villarreal can step up from the Europa to Champions League if Barcelona is out. A Spanish
                          reshuffle would likely see eighth-place Athletic Bilbao get into the Conference League.

                          Rickie Fowler is signing with TGL, the joint venture launched by Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy,
                          according to ESPN's Mark Schlabach. Woods and McIlroy announced in August they were starting TGL, a
                          "tech-infused golf league" that utilizes a team format. With Fowler on board, organizers have
                          filled 12 of the 18 player slots. TGL will mark a significant departure from traditional golf
                          tournaments. The season consists of 15 two-hour matches on Monday nights leading up to the
                          playoffs. A venue with a virtual course is under construction in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, ahead
                          of the January start. Justin Thomas, Jon Rahm and Collin Morikawa are among the notable stars who
                          have committed to the project alongside Woods and McIlroy. Fowler is one of the most well-known
                          golfers on the PGA Tour. He finished 16th in the Player Impact Program rankings in 2022. Though his
                          last win came in February 2019 at the Waste Management Phoenix Open, the 34-year-old is turning
                          around his performance this season. He has three top-10 finishes in 10 PGA Tour events, the most
                          recent of which was a 10th-place showing in the WM Phoenix Open one month ago.

Question 110              : Who is the director of BioShock movie?

                          No gods or kings, only Hollywood creatives Streaming giants Netflix have a BioShock movie to make
                          and, after pointing their golf club at various directors, they’ve selected Francis Lawrence. He’s
                          best known for overseeing three of The Hunger Games movies and is working on the prequel coming out
                          next year, The Ballad Of Songbirds And Snakes. Netflix have also hired screenwriter Michael Green
                          for the BioShock flick. Green wrote the Kenneth Branagh versions of Agatha Christie’s Murder On The
                          Orient Express and Death On The Nile. I guess that means he’s got experience of period settings.
                          Netflix revealed they were planning a BioShock movie back in February, and seem to want it to
                          become a cinematic universe. Pirates Of The Carribean director Gore Verbinski was the first
                          director attached to a possible movie based on Andrew Ryan’s undersea shenanigans only a year after
                          the game was released, but that fell through. Ken Levine said that he personally killed another
                          attempt by 28 Weeks Later director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo a few years later. Along with the
                          BioShock developments, Netflix announced that they’re setting on The Umbrella Academy’s Michael
                          Blackman as showrunner for their upcoming TV series based on Horizon Zero Dawn. Asked whether game
                          protagonist Aloy would be the main character, Blackman said that she’ll be “a main character in our
                          story”. Going to fill in the gaps there and take that to mean the show will be an ensemble.

                          “BioShock Infinite” was released in 2013 and took place in the steampunk, airborne city of Columbia
                          in 1912. “Netflix is among the best and most forward-thinking storytellers in all of entertainment
                          today,” said Strauss Zelnick, chairman and CEO of Take-Two Interactive in a statement. “We are
                          thrilled that they share our vision and commitment to the ‘BioShock’ franchise, which is beloved by
                          millions of fans around the world. 2K’s Cloud Chamber studio is deep in active development on the
                          next iteration of the series, and coupled with our partnership with Netflix, we remain highly
                          confident that ‘BioShock’ will continue to captivate and engage audiences like never before.” This
                          isn’t the first time an adaptation of “BioShock” was launched. Director Gore Verbinski was attached
                          to a live-action film from Universal, but it was scrapped after a ballooning budget in 2009. Across
                          the titles’ original releases as well as multiple re-releases, remastered editions and bundled
                          collections, the “BioShock” series has sold more than 39 million copies worldwide, and it’s widely
                          recognized as one of the most celebrated and beloved series in all of gaming.

                          The story is based on the book Twelve Patients: Life and Death at Bellevue Hospital by Eric
                          Manheimer who also doubles as a producer on the show. Peter Horton and David Schulner are Executive

                          official trailer yet for Season 5 of New Amsterdam. Season 5 premieres on Tuesday, September 20,
                          2022, at 10 PM ET/PT on NBC. As with previous seasons, you can watch and stream all episodes on
                          Peacock. The show will retain its 10 pm ET/PT time slot on NBC. New episodes will usually stream a
                          day later on Peacock. New Amsterdam Season 5 will be the series' shortest season as it will have
                          just 13 episodes bringing the total number across all seasons to 92 episodes. One of the biggest
                          developments around New Amsterdam Season 5 is that Freema Agyeman, who has played Dr. Helen Sharpe
                          since the show’s debut will not be returning to the show. This piece of information has left fans
                          of the show distraught. Any chances of her character getting back together is well and truly dashed.

                          Four years later in Munich, host West Germany came from behind to win 2-1 against a star-studded

                          like Messi at Qatar 2022, Diego Maradona almost single-handedly drove his team to its second title
                          in eight years, beating West Germany 3-2 in the final. In 1998, France hosted and won its first
                          World Cup, mainly down to the genius of Zinedine Zidane, who scored twice in the final, to beat a

                          As they began to leave the nest, I started to fill my time with other things. I recorded a
                          year-long radio show called “Get Real,” which dives into classical metaphysics. I am a client
                          manager for AuctusIQ, a company specializing in developing global sales forces. I started a home
                          staging business. And, by the way, I have some umbrellas to sell. They all say, “Trish Said It
                          Would,” if I can find anyone interested. Lol. Then • In 1978, I started on the weekend news at KTVI
                          my freshman year at St. Louis University, where I majored in meteorology. For a couple of years in
                          the early '80s I did the weekend weather alongside Christine Buck at KPLR. I stayed there until
                          going back to weekends at KTVI when Ron Yaros was promoted to the weeknight broadcasts. Because I
                          was working full-time while a full-time student, it took a few additional years to earn my
                          bachelor’s degree. But that extra time allowed me to hone on my broadcasting skills guided by the
                          wonderful mentors who were on the weekends with me those last few years: Sports anchor Greg
                          Gizinski and news anchors Al Ruechel and Donn Johnson. I also used the time to take a couple of
                          graduate-level courses. In the fall of 1985, I left St. Louis for my first full-time, multi-year
                          contract with KMBC in Kansas City.

Question 115              : How much money did Texas Tech pay Marlene Stollings in the settlement?

                          That same month, Texas Tech paid $740,000 to settle a breach-of-contract lawsuit filed by former
                          women’s basketball coach Marlene Stollings, who was fired in 2020 following a joint investigation
                          by The Intercollegiate and USA Today. The reporting uncovered, through public records requests, a
                          trove of athlete exit interview surveys in the school’s possession, with claims of abuse made
                          against Stollings by at least a dozen athletes over two years. Nevertheless, Texas Tech didn’t so
                          much as suspended the coach until firing her the day after the story was published, though TTU had
                          initiated an internal investigation several months before. In her lawsuit filed against the school
                          and Hocutt, Stollings accused her former boss of terminating her to “deflect blame” after realizing
                          that his “own position was at risk.” While denying the merit of Stollings’ “inflammatory”
                          allegations, Hocutt and the university filed motions to dismiss on account of Texas’ qualified
                          immunity law, which shields public officials from liability “when they are acting within their
                          discretionary authority and their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or
                          constitutional law.” It’s the same regulation that allowed Texas Tech to ward off an employment
                          lawsuit filed by former football coach Mike Leach.

                          advisors On August 17, 2022, NBC unveiled the list of “The Voice” mentors for the upcoming battle
                          rounds. The battle advisors for this season are Jazmine Sullivan for Team Legend, Sean Paul for
                          Team Gwen, Charlie Puth for Team Camila, and Jimmie Allen for Team Blake. “The Voice” format “The
                          Voice” always begins with the blind auditions, in which aspiring artists sing to the backs of the
                          coaching panel. If a judge likes what they hear, they push their “I Want You” button, which turns
                          their chair around. If more than one coach pushes their button, then the artist gets to choose
                          which team they want to join. Following that initial round, the show pivots to the battles and
                          knockouts, which is when each of the coaches pare down their teams, and finally to the live
                          playoffs, which is when America gets to vote for their favorite performers.

                          The identities of the victims have not been released. The Ford Ecoline cargo van had New York

                          A horrific overnight crash on the Palisades Interstate Parkway in Englewood Cliffs left four people
                          dead Friday, officials said. A shuttle van that takes people to and from factories in upstate New
                          York overturned in the crash at about 1:30 a.m., the Palisades Interstate Parkway Police said in a
                          statement. Four people were pronounced dead at the scene while eight others were taken to nearby
                          hospitals with injuries ranging from severe head trauma to minor physical complaints, police said.
                          The identities of the victims have not been released. The Ford Ecoline cargo van had New York

                          when he accepted the head-coaching position at Virginia Tech in December 2021. Under the previous
                          regime, the Hokies had fallen off, lacked talent across the entire roster and left broken
                          relationships with high schools throughout the state. Pry went to work, helping close on a solid
                          class for 2022. If you have a Twitter account, you’d see each of Pry’s assistants hitting the road
                          at every open period, visiting high schools throughout the recruiting footprint, whether those
                          schools had recruitable prospects or not. But Pry knew he needed to win. And unfortunately, the
                          Hokies didn’t do a lot of winning in 2022. Tech had its worst season since 1992 last fall,
                          finishing 3-8, with the last game of the season against Virginia canceled. A seven-game losing
                          streak is what most will remember from last season. While some of those losses were ugly, Tech did
                          show improvement but unfortunately blew late leads against N.C. State, Miami and Georgia Tech.
                          Heading into 2023, there is optimism surrounding the Hokies. While no one is expecting Virginia
                          Tech to win the ACC, the Hokies were active in the NCAA transfer portal, adding talent at
                          quarterback, running back, wide receiver, offensive line, defensive end, and in the secondary.

                          the spirits not just within the locker room but also throughout Blacksburg. The redshirt senior
                          from Woodbridge used to get asked when strolling through campus or nearby neighborhoods how
                          relatable Fuente was to his players, with fans expressing their distaste for the former coach.
                          “That’s one thing I thought was crazy because last year, the year before, we would walk around, and
                          people would be like: ‘Do you like Fuente? Because I don’t,’ ” Dzansi said. “And now it’s like:
                          ‘Oh, how do you like Coach Pry? Because we love him.’ It’s so different. It’s such a big
                          turnaround.” New Virginia football coach Tony Elliott has players buying in early But it hasn’t
                          been only Pry’s vibrant personality that has energized the Hokies, who last season finished 12th
                          out of 14 schools in the ACC in total offense (361.6 yards per game) and second to last in scoring
                          (23.7 points) and lost three straight games at Lane Stadium for the third time in four years. He

                          scoring defense (17.3 points per game) and third in the red zone (66.7 percent) last year.

                          semifinalist in 2017, died on Aug. 27 after her first solo skydiving jump when her main parachute
                          failed to open in time. She was 21. According to multiple reports, Tanya had taken one skydiving
                          course, which made her eligible for the solo jump. The Toronto University student completed the
                          course at Skydive Toronto in Ontario, but things turned fatal last weekend after the main parachute
                          failed to open. By the time it finally did, Tanya was at too low an altitude. "Saturday, August
                          27th, at approximately 6:00 p.m. EDT, a skydiving student aged 21 succumbed to fatal injuries
                          obtained from an emergency situation," read a statement posted on Skydive Toronto's Facebook page.
                          "The skydiver released a quickly rotating main parachute at a low altitude without the
                          time/altitude required for the reserve parachute to inflate." Following the accident, Tanya was

                          the police on its investigation. "Tanya had an interest in anything that was new and adventurous,"
                          childhood friend Melody Ozgoli told CTV News Toronto.

                          and coached twenty-two All-Americans, but perhaps his most lasting achievement was the hiring of
                          Osborne as offensive coordinator in 1969.[4] Osborne was named Devaney's successor in 1973, and

                          were at 16/5. The series also took home three individual juried awards: Julien Georgel (Art

                          been pushing the boundaries of animated television since its debut in 1997. The show follows the
                          adventures of four foul-mouthed boys from a small town in Colorado as they navigate the absurdities
                          of everyday life. What sets South Park apart is its irreverent humor and biting social commentary,
                          tackling everything from politics to pop culture. The animation style is deliberately crude, but it
                          works perfectly with the show's humor and satire. The characters are outrageous, but each one has a
                          distinct personality that audiences can easily recognize. The show's ability to tackle taboo
                          subjects and make people laugh while doing it is what makes it worth multiple wins. South Park has
                          proven that animation can be used to tell more than just kid-friendly stories, and it continues to
                          be one of the most unique and groundbreaking shows on television. Related: All The Multi-Part South

Question 127              : How many teams will be included in the expanded College Football Playoff?
Correct Answers         :  
                          12
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prediction (only positive):
  - Answer              : 12
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          The CFP announced Thursday it will expand to a 12-team event in two years, completing an 18-month
                          process that was fraught with delays and disagreements. It is a momentous step that will bring in
                          billions of dollars in television revenue and change the very fabric of the postseason. The
                          announcement came a day after the Rose Bowl agreed to amend its contract for the 2024 and 2025
                          seasons, the last hurdle CFP officials needed cleared to triple the size of what is now a four-team
                          format. “I never gave up,” Hancock said. Expansion is expected to produce about $450 million in
                          additional gross revenue for the conferences and schools that participate. The CFP’s current
                          12-year contract with ESPN runs through the 2025-26 season. CFP officials have said they would like
                          to explore having multiple broadcast partners in the next cycle. The idea of major college football
                          holding a playoff dates back decades and the Championship Subdivision has had one since 1978. The
                          late Penn State coach Joe Paterno pined for one in the 1970s. Former Big Eight Commissioner Chuck
                          Nienas proposed one in the late 1980s. The creation of the BCS in the late 1990s was the first step
                          toward a real playoff, Hancock said. “The BCS for the first time gave an opportunity to decide a
                          national champion on the field every year, not just at the whims of the bowl pairings,” Hancock
                          said.

                          Board of Managers, in the official release. "More teams, more participation and more excitement are
                          good for our fans, alumni, and student-athletes. I'm grateful to my colleagues on the board for
                          their thoughtful approach to this issue and for their resolve to get expansion across the goal line
                          and for the extensive work of the Management Committee that made this decision possible." Enter

                          The CFP announced Thursday it will expand to a 12-team event in two years, completing an 18-month
                          process that was fraught with delays and disagreements. It is a momentous step that will bring in
                          billions of dollars in television revenue and change the very fabric of the postseason. The
                          announcement came a day after the Rose Bowl agreed to amend its contract for the 2024 and 2025
                          seasons, the last hurdle CFP officials needed cleared to triple the size of what is now a four-team
                          format. “I never gave up,” Hancock said. Expansion is expected to produce about $450 million in
                          additional gross revenue for the conferences and schools that participate. The CFP’s current
                          12-year contract with ESPN runs through the 2025-26 season. CFP officials have said they would like
                          to explore having multiple broadcast partners in the next cycle. The idea of major college football
                          holding a playoff dates back decades and the Championship Subdivision has had one since 1978. The
                          late Penn State coach Joe Paterno pined for one in the 1970s. Former Big Eight Commissioner Chuck
                          Nienas proposed one in the late 1980s. The creation of the BCS in the late 1990s was the first step
                          toward a real playoff, Hancock said. “The BCS for the first time gave an opportunity to decide a
                          national champion on the field every year, not just at the whims of the bowl pairings,” Hancock
                          said.

                          Three months after the corrupt defense contractor known as “Fat Leonard” brazenly, and easily,
                          escaped from his luxury home detention arrangement in San Diego, the circumstances behind how the
                          Malaysian tycoon pulled it off are still under wraps. Demands from members of the U.S. House and
                          Senate for more details about Leonard Francis’ embarrassing escape have been brushed off by the
                          Department of Justice and met with silence from the Administrative Office of the Courts, which
                          handles the nonjudicial, bureaucratic business for the federal courts. And last week, San Diego
                          federal Judge Janis Sammartino, who oversaw Francis’ unusual, yearslong medical furlough that
                          allowed him to live outside of jail, rebuffed a demand from defense lawyers for more details about
                          Francis’ health and living conditions. “Who was or wasn’t responsible for Leonard Francis’
                          supervision and monitoring is not the issue,” Joseph Mancano, the lawyer for convicted retired
                          Capt. David Newland, told Sammartino during a hearing Wednesday. Instead, he said, the issue was
                          that the defense was entitled to that information before the trial, to show jurors that while
                          Francis had been a cooperating witness for years, he was given extraordinary benefits by the
                          government. Newland is one of four former Navy officers who were convicted of conspiracy and
                          bribery charges at a lengthy trial this year.

                          Hardware Image: Mark Zuckerberg / Instagram Meta is likely to reveal more about the rumoured Meta
                          Quest Pro VR device at the annual Meta Connect showcase, taking place in October 2022. This headset
                          is set to be the next iteration of the popular VR device line, and is said to support mixed reality
                          experiences, while also having higher visual fidelity than its predecessors. The device, which may
                          actually be the mystery Meta device codenamed ‘Project Cambria’, will reportedly launch by the end
                          of 2022, and could be a more better-featured, more refined option when compared to the current Meta
                          Quest 2 device. It will also likely carry a more expensive price tag. In a recent episode of the
                          Joe Rogan Experience, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg appeared to enthuse about a ‘Quest Pro’ with
                          features including eye and facial tracking being discussed, as well as the ability to sync up a
                          digital avatar for more lifelike social interactions. Zuckerberg later teased the device in a post
                          on Meta. Read: New details confirmed for PlayStation VR 2, including ‘see-through view’ It’s
                          currently unclear how far along the rumoured Meta Quest Pro VR device is – but it’s likely we’ll
                          get a better glimpse when Meta Connect 2022 airs. This show will feature Meta’s vision for the
                          expanding ‘metaverse’ and will also introduce a number of innovations from leaders in the AR, VR
                          and XR spaces.

                          Hodge2022-09-06T19:30:00+01:00 Instagram is set to be fined 405 million euros (U.S. $401 million)
                          by Ireland’s data protection regulator for failing to adequately secure teenage users’ data in line
                          with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The penalty will be the largest to date handed
                          down by the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC), the primary European data regulator for the
                          social media giant. It is the third fine in the past year against a subsidiary of Meta, following
                          sanctions of €17 million (then-U.S. $18.6 million) in March against Meta Ireland (formerly Facebook
                          Ireland) and €225 million (then-U.S. $267 million) in September 2021 against WhatsApp. The
                          Instagram fine will be the second largest imposed under the GDPR, behind a €746 million (U.S. $739
                          million) penalty weighed against Amazon in Luxembourg last year. In an emailed statement, a
                          spokesperson for the Irish DPC confirmed it adopted its final decision Friday regarding the
                          Instagram fine. Full details in the case are expected to be published next week. A spokesperson for
                          Meta said the company intends to appeal the decision. “While we’ve engaged fully with the DPC
                          throughout their inquiry, we disagree with how this fine was calculated,” the spokesperson said.
                          “We’re continuing to carefully review the rest of the decision.

                          Gotham Knights is a 2022 action role-playing game developed by WB Games Montréal and published by
                          Warner Bros. Games. Inspired by the Batman: Gotham Knights comic series and based on the DC Comics
                          character Batman and his supporting cast, the game focuses on the characters Nightwing, Batgirl,
                          Robin, and Red Hood as they attempt to restore justice to Gotham City during a period of decline in
                          the immediate aftermath of Batman's death. While investigating the events that led to their
                          mentor's demise, the heroes become embroiled in an ancient conflict between two secret
                          organizations fighting for control of Gotham: the Court of Owls and the League of Shadows. Gameplay
                          is presented from the third-person perspective with a primary focus on using each playable
                          character's traversal and combat abilities to defeat enemies and explore the environment. Players
                          can freely move around Gotham City, interacting with characters, undertaking missions, and gaining
                          experience points and other resources to level up their characters and equipment. Outside of the
                          story, players are able to complete side missions to unlock additional content and collectible
                          items. A cooperative online multiplayer mode is also included, allowing two players to play through
                          the single-player campaign together while progressing in their own game. Gotham Knights was
                          released on October 21, 2022, for PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series X/S. Versions for the
                          PlayStation 4 and Xbox One were also planned, but were ultimately cancelled.

                          During his later years, Shaw enjoyed tending the gardens at Shaw's Corner. He died at the age of
                          ninety-four of renal failure precipitated by injuries incurred when falling while pruning a
                          tree.[212] He was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium on 6 November 1950. His ashes, mixed with
                          those of Charlotte, were scattered along footpaths and around the statue of Saint Joan in their
                          garden.[213][214] Shaw published a collected edition of his plays in 1934, comprising forty-two
                          works.[215] He wrote a further twelve in the remaining sixteen years of his life, mostly one-act
                          pieces. Including eight earlier plays that he chose to omit from his published works, the total is
                          sixty-two.[n 25] 1890s Full-length plays Adaptation Short play Shaw's first three full-length plays

                          concerns the landlords of slum properties, and introduces the first of Shaw's New Women—a recurring
                          feature of later plays.[217] The Philanderer (1893) develops the theme of the New Woman, draws on
                          Ibsen, and has elements of Shaw's personal relationships, the character of Julia being based on
                          Jenny Patterson.

                          garden.[213][214] Shaw published a collected edition of his plays in 1934, comprising forty-two
                          works.[215] He wrote a further twelve in the remaining sixteen years of his life, mostly one-act
                          pieces. Including eight earlier plays that he chose to omit from his published works, the total is
                          sixty-two.[n 25] 1890s Full-length plays Adaptation Short play Shaw's first three full-length plays
                          dealt with social issues. He later grouped them as "Plays Unpleasant".[216] Widowers' Houses (1892)
                          concerns the landlords of slum properties, and introduces the first of Shaw's New Women—a recurring
                          feature of later plays.[217] The Philanderer (1893) develops the theme of the New Woman, draws on
                          Ibsen, and has elements of Shaw's personal relationships, the character of Julia being based on
                          Jenny Patterson.

                          Two days before her death, on 6 September 2022, the Queen accepted the resignation of Boris Johnson
                          and appointed Liz Truss to succeed him as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; these meetings took
                          place at Balmoral Castle, rather than their usual location, Buckingham Palace.[22] At the meeting
                          with Truss, the final public photos of the Queen were taken by Jane Barlow. Social media users were
                          quick to observe the Queen’s continued use of a walking stick, her frail, “ghostly” appearance, and
                          a large bruise-like mark on her right hand. After the Queen’s death, Barlow said that while she
                          could tell the Queen was unwell, she was “in quite good spirits.” On 7 September, the Queen was
                          scheduled to attend an online meeting of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom to swear in new
                          ministers in Truss's government, but this was cancelled after she was advised by doctors to
                          rest.[23] The Queen's final public statement, issued that same day, was a message of condolences
                          for the victims of a mass stabbing incident in Saskatchewan, Canada.[24] The Queen died at 15:10
                          BST on 8 September 2022 at the age of 96, ending her 70-year reign. According to her death
                          certificate, which was made public on 29 September, she died of old age.[2] Her death was publicly
                          announced at 18:30.

                          Elizabeth II (Elizabeth Alexandra Mary; 21 April 1926 – 8 September 2022) was Queen of the United
                          Kingdom and other Commonwealth realms from 6 February 1952 until her death in 2022. She was queen
                          regnant of 32 sovereign states over the course of her lifetime and remained the monarch of 15
                          realms by the time of her death. Her reign of over 70 years is the longest of any British monarch
                          and the longest verified reign of any female head of state in history. Elizabeth was born in
                          Mayfair, London, as the first child of the Duke and Duchess of York (later King George VI and Queen
                          Elizabeth The Queen Mother). Her father acceded to the throne in 1936 upon the abdication of his
                          brother Edward VIII, making the ten-year-old Princess Elizabeth the heir presumptive. She was
                          educated privately at home and began to undertake public duties during the Second World War,
                          serving in the Auxiliary Territorial Service. In November 1947, she married Philip Mountbatten, a
                          former prince of Greece and Denmark, and their marriage lasted 73 years until his death in 2021.
                          They had four children: Charles, Anne, Andrew, and Edward.

                          ceremony built on ancient traditions, at a time when the U.K. monarchy faces an uncertain future.
                          (May. 6) LONDON (AP) — King Charles III was crowned Saturday at Westminster Abbey, in a ceremony
                          steeped in ancient ritual and brimming with bling at a time when the monarchy is striving to remain
                          relevant in a fractured modern Britain. At a coronation with displays of royal power straight out
                          of the Middle Ages, Charles was given an orb, a sword and scepter and had the solid gold, bejeweled
                          St. Edward’s Crown placed atop his head as he sat upon a 700-year-old oak chair. In front of world
                          leaders, foreign royals, dignitaries and a smattering of stars, the monarch declared, “I come not
                          to be served but to serve,” and was presented as Britain’s “undoubted king.” Inside the medieval
                          abbey, trumpets sounded, and the congregation of more than 2,000 shouted “God save the king!”
                          Outside, thousands of troops, hundreds of thousands of spectators and scores of protesters
                          converged. It was the culmination of a seven-decade journey for the king from heir to monarch. To
                          the royal family and government, the occasion — code-named Operation Golden Orb — was a display of
                          heritage, tradition and spectacle unmatched around the world.

                          a collection of greatest hits and studio albums that have been certified by the Recording Industry
                          Association of America. He also has a host of Academy of Country Music Awards, in addition to
                          Grammy Award nominations. But the "You're Gonna Miss This" singer admitted he was a little
                          intimidated to work with legendary actress Susan Sarandon in their upcoming country music drama
                          about a dynasty of singers in "Monarch." Adkins portrays Albie Roman alongside Sarandon, who plays
                          Dottie Cantrell Roman, in the series, which is set to debut in September on FOX, and marks his
                          first starring role. He told Fox News Digital that working with Sarandon was "terrifying," but he
                          knew he was learning the ropes from a true icon. "It was terrifying at first, but then very quickly
                          I realized that she is so good, so professional, that she is going to carry the scene," Adkins
                          said. "You just try to hang on and make it to the buzzer, and she’ll take care of it. When asked
                          what it was like to kiss the Academy Award-winning actress, he simply replied: "It was an honor.

                          As a satirical look at our era’s growing fascination with celebrity in the digital age, there’s
                          something to the fact that we are often the orchestrators of our own demise since shortcuts don’t
                          need strong foundations. So while not without its flaws, there is still a lot to like about what
                          Kargman puts on-screen. It showcases hubris incarnate as it destroys a “good” person by pushing her
                          into corners that demand “bad” decisions to be made. Clemons is great in the role too. There’s
                          always a keen sense of artifice that contradicts the way so many others see her smile as a sign of
                          purity rather than a mask hiding the fact that her intelligence has corrupted her moral compass.
                          Wolff excels by being her antithesis—morality refusing to bend to stardom. I like that it all gets
                          darker as it continues and plays with earlier set-ups in perhaps surprising ways, but the pacing
                          does leave a bit to be desired. A solid, imperfect debut. Susie Searches premiered at the 2022

                          True crime podcasts have swiftly gone from a fringe hobby to a booming business, spurring not only
                          a slew of shows, much merch, and a hit TV comedy series, but also a lot of questions about the
                          ethics of civilians poking their noses into real-life tragedies. Everyone wants to be a hero. But
                          what lengths might one go to get there? This is the winsome yet disturbing journey at the center of
                          Susie Searches. Kiersey Clemons stars as Susie Wallis, a socially awkward college student with a
                          mind for solving mysteries. Naturally, she has her own true crime podcast called Susie Searches, so
                          when fellow student/meditation influencer Jesse (Alex Wolff) goes missing, her interest in cracking
                          the case isn't exactly selfless. If she finds the internet-adored victim, she and her podcast could
                          score the validation she desperately craves. Whether she's squeezing the sheriff (Jim Gaffigan) for
                          clues, eying a convenient creep (Ken Marino) as a suspect, or scouting out evidence, Susie is on a

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          By Alex Zietlow Kyle Busch is moving from one storied racing team to another. The multi-time NASCAR
                          Cup Series champion will join Richard Childress Racing in 2023, according to a report from Jordan
                          Bianchi of The Athletic. The move ends a successful 15-year tenure with Joe Gibbs Racing. An
                          official announcement is expected Tuesday, per the report. The news punctuates an eventful and
                          “stressful” regular season for Busch, whose free agency dominated headlines and clouded a
                          playoff-caliber season in 2022. It did so because his looming free agency revealed a strange
                          reality in NASCAR economics — that one of the sport’s biggest stars would have to struggle to find
                          a home (even with taking a pay cut) because of something outside of his control. That “something”
                          outside of his control, in this case, was the result of the Mars Inc. decision to exit NASCAR at
                          the end of the year, leaving Joe Gibbs Racing (Busch’s current team) without a primary sponsor for
                          Busch’s No. 18 team. Busch confirmed to reporters earlier this month that he had “more than one”
                          team extend official contract offers to him. RCR was among those companies, per reports at the
                          time. He also said that his uncertain future had been weighing on him. “It weighs on you every
                          time, every day of the week,” Busch said at NASCAR’s playoff media day before the race at
                          Darlington.

                          His career average finish is 13.8, and no full-time RCR driver has reached that mark since Ryan
                          Newman in 2015. And on top of driving for RCR, his deal is also leading him to swap manufacturers
                          for Kyle Busch Motorsports in the Craftsman Truck Series. His team will be branded by Chevrolet in
                          2023, a major overhaul with Chase Purdy and Jack Wood joining the team. Fortunately for Busch, he
                          will not have to worry about finding sponsors at RCR. 3CHI, Alsco, BetMGM, Cheddars and Lenovo have
                          all confirmed they will sponsor the No. 8 car. And if anyone can bring back a championship trophy
                          to RCR, it will be Busch.

Question 144              : What is men's year-end No 1 in tennis in 2022?
Correct Answers         :

  - Source              :
                          Carlos Alcaraz is set to become the youngest year-end No. 1 in the history of men’s tennis after
                          Rafael Nadal was knocked out of the ATP Finals. At the age of 19 years and 214 days, US Open
                          champion Alcaraz surpasses Lleyton Hewitt’s record of ending the year as world No. 1 aged 20 years
                          and 275 days in 2001. Alcaraz is missing this year’s ATP Finals in Turin, Italy as he continues his
                          recovery from an abdominal injury sustained at the Paris Masters earlier this month, but compatriot
                          Nadal’s early exit from the tournament means he still has cause to celebrate. The teenager has
                          enjoyed a sensational year, winning five ATP titles and becoming the youngest No. 1 in men’s tennis
                          when he won his first grand slam title in New York. Nadal could have leapfrogged Alcaraz at the top
                          of the world rankings with victory in Turin this week, but after he lost 6-3 6-4 against Felix
                          Auger-Aliassime on Tuesday and Casper Ruud won a set against Taylor Fritz, the 36-year-old bowed
                          out of the tournament. Nadal has struggled for form since the US Open in September and against
                          Auger-Aliassime fell to his fourth consecutive feat since 2009.

                          While Lex’s presence is short-lived, the actor who plays him Titus Welliver understands that
                          there’s a significance to his fleeting time with Superboy — particularly in the absence of Superman

                          The 49-year-old South Korean actor beats four others, including veteran actor Brian Cox of
                          Succession fame. Actor Lee Jung-jae, who played the moral centre in Squid Game, has become the
                          first Asian and South Korean to win the Emmy for best drama series actor, one of four awards picked
                          by the hit Netflix series. Lee on Monday bested a crowded field that featured Jason Bateman for
                          Ozark, Brian Cox as the patriarch and Jeremy Strong as his son in Succession, Bob Odenkirk for
                          Better Call Saul, and Adam Scott for Severance. Squid Game is a dark drama that tells the story of
                          people who compete in a deadly competition to erase their financial debt. The series had topped
                          Netflix viewing charts in multiple countries, kickstarted sales of tracksuits and Vans sneakers,
                          and kindled global interest in learning Korean. “Thank you for making realistic problems we all
                          face come to life so creatively on the screen,” Lee, aged 49, said to Hwang Dong-hyuk, creator of
                          Squid Game who also won the Emmy for best drama series direction. Congrats again to @SquidGame's

                          numerous significant events. She interviewed the embattled R&B singer R. Kelly, former President

                          Nintendo has guarded the new Breath of the Wild game so tightly that players do not even know the
                          title of the new Legend of Zelda. Fans have called the Nintendo game The Legend of Zelda: Breath of
                          the Wild 2, BOTW 2, and the Sequel to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. However, according
                          to a new rumor, the Breath of the Wild 2 name may finally have leaked online. While “new details”
                          about the Zelda game come and go, the newest rumor might hold more water than the others. While the
                          alleged title is still a rumor, the next adventure of Link and Zelda is “The Legend of Zelda:
                          Breath of Duality.” According to Nintendo Life, the report comes from veteran video game journalist
                          Paul Gale “who runs his own website, appeared in Nintendo Power, and worked with many other video
                          game outlets over the years,” according to Nintendo Life. In a post, Gale reports that “the sequel
                          to BotW and its main hook is right in the name, which establishes on the ‘Breath’ familiarity from
                          the 2017 hit and [gives] a nod to the fact that you can play as more than the aforementioned
                          title’s Link (including various, polar themes), hence ‘Duality.’” RUMOR: A potential Breath of the

                          “The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom” is perhaps the most highly anticipated video game of
                          the year. (In fact, it won that very award in 2022 – the wait has been long.) And by all accounts,
                          it’s living up to the hype: “Tears of the Kingdom,” released May 12, has already broken sales
                          records, earned raves from experts like IGN and longtime “Zelda” fans, and driven some fans to take
                          time off from work to dive into its intricate, enveloping world. The very first “Zelda” game was
                          released in 1986, and almost 40 years later, Link’s adventures are still enchanting gamers and
                          infuriating those who don’t have over 100 hours to spend discovering the game’s many hidden
                          treasures. Here’s what you need to know about the newest installment in the “Zelda” franchise, sans
                          spoilers. Link, now a knight of the kingdom of Hyrule, just got done saving Hyrule in 2017’s
                          acclaimed game, “Breath of the Wild.” But just when he thought he could hand up his green tunic,
                          super-villain Ganondorf returns to wreak havoc, taking the wise Princess Zelda with him. Link sets
                          out to find her – and to once again save Hyrule from one of its most prevalent threats. But oh!

                          popular Halloween film, “Hocus Pocus”, will be coming to Disney+ on September 30th 2022.

                          Sarah Jessica Parker (“Sex and the City”) and Kathy Najimy (“Sister Act”) back as her sisters,
                          Sarah and Mary, respectively. In “Hocus Pocus 2,” three young women accidentally bring the

                          Sanderson, respectively. Behind the scenes, the sequel was written by Jen D'Angelo and was
                          originally set to be directed by Adam Shankman. Following a scheduling conflict (thanks to
                          Shankman's work on Disenchanted), Anne Fletcher took over but Shankman stayed on as executive
                          producer. Along with the official announcement in May 2021, we got our first plot details about
                          what we can expect from the sequel. "Three young women accidentally bring the Sanderson Sisters

                          a girl called Isabella who Poppy has a crush on. In order to impress Isabella, Poppy sneaks into
                          the Sanderson house during a blood moon and accidentally brings the sisters back to life. It's
                          unclear if this is exactly what will happen in the movie sequel, so might end up being non-canon.
                          The first movie ended (spoiler alert) with the magic book winking its eye, proving it's still alive
                          and the witches could return... Ooo0ooo000ooOOOoo.

                          feedback LONDON (AP) — Queen Elizabeth II’s funeral and lying-in-state last year cost Britain’s
                          government an estimated 162 million pounds (around $200 million), the treasury revealed Thursday.
                          The state funeral for the late monarch, held on Sept. 19, was the first in the U.K. since that of
                          former Prime Minister Winston Churchill in 1965. The occasion, attended by world leaders and
                          dignitaries, followed 10 days of national mourning after the queen died at age 96 on Sept. 8 after
                          70 years on the throne. Hundreds of thousands of people were drawn to London’s Westminster Hall to
                          see the United Kingdom’s longest-serving monarch lying in state. READ MORE: What to know about

                          Thursday as part of a written statement to Parliament. “The government’s priorities were that these
                          events ran smoothly and with the appropriate level of dignity, while at all times ensuring the
                          safety and security of the public,” said John Glen, chief secretary to the treasury, in a
                          statement. Elizabeth and her husband, Prince Philip, were both interred at St. George’s Chapel in
                          Windsor Castle.

Question 161              : Where did Queen Elizabeth II's state funeral take place?

                          The hearse carrying Queen Elizabeth II's coffin stopped briefly as it arrived in the town of
                          Windsor, west of London, on Monday afternoon, so troops from the British Army's Grenadier Guards
                          could take their places flanking the vehicle for it's slow, final push to Windsor Castle. Once the
                          procession reaches the grounds of Windsor Castle, it will be joined by King Charles III and the
                          other senior members of the royal family. The Royal Standard, a flag representing the Sovereign and
                          the United Kingdom, was raised over Windsor Castle on Monday as the hearse carrying Queen Elizabeth
                          II's coffin made its way through west London toward Windsor. The standard always flies above any
                          royal castle or palace when the sovereign is there, so it being raised on Monday was a sign that
                          the late queen's son, King Charles III, had arrived at the royal residence ahead of the committal
                          service for his mother. Queen Elizabeth II will be laid to rest at the family's cemetery at St.
                          George's Chapel, on the Windsor Castle grounds. Queen Elizabeth II made her final procession
                          through London on Monday after the state funeral service was held for her at Westminster Abbey.
                          Throughout the process, her coffin was heavily decorated in regalia, all representing various
                          aspects of the queen's life and legacy. Royal contributor Tina Brown told CBS News that the items
                          that draped and sat on top of the queen's coffin added historic symbolism to this "moving moment.

                          holds the hereditary title Earl Marshal responsible for organizing state occasions such as this,
                          said the funeral will reflect the "unique and timeless position" the queen held in the lives of
                          millions, and the sense of loss shared around the world. "It is our aim and belief that the state
                          funeral and events of the next few days will unite people across the globe and resonate with people
                          of all faiths, whilst fulfilling Her Majesty and her family’s wishes to pay a fitting tribute to an
                          extraordinary reign," the duke told reporters. It will be the grandest the British can muster, a

                          Winston Churchill. Hers will be the first state funeral in the United Kingdom since Churchill's in
                          1965. A state funeral is organized and paid for by the state and combines the ceremonies and
                          rituals for the sovereign with those of any family's funeral for a loved one. A royal family is
                          mourning; they just have to do it in public.

                          The hearse carrying Queen Elizabeth II's coffin stopped briefly as it arrived in the town of
                          Windsor, west of London, on Monday afternoon, so troops from the British Army's Grenadier Guards
                          could take their places flanking the vehicle for it's slow, final push to Windsor Castle. Once the
                          procession reaches the grounds of Windsor Castle, it will be joined by King Charles III and the
                          other senior members of the royal family. The Royal Standard, a flag representing the Sovereign and
                          the United Kingdom, was raised over Windsor Castle on Monday as the hearse carrying Queen Elizabeth
                          II's coffin made its way through west London toward Windsor. The standard always flies above any
                          royal castle or palace when the sovereign is there, so it being raised on Monday was a sign that
                          the late queen's son, King Charles III, had arrived at the royal residence ahead of the committal
                          service for his mother. Queen Elizabeth II will be laid to rest at the family's cemetery at St.
                          George's Chapel, on the Windsor Castle grounds. Queen Elizabeth II made her final procession
                          through London on Monday after the state funeral service was held for her at Westminster Abbey.
                          Throughout the process, her coffin was heavily decorated in regalia, all representing various
                          aspects of the queen's life and legacy. Royal contributor Tina Brown told CBS News that the items
                          that draped and sat on top of the queen's coffin added historic symbolism to this "moving moment.

                          The artificial intelligence (AI) group sparked resounding laughter with their finale performance
                          that saw them use their deep fake technology to create an on-stage musical collaboration between
                          Cowell, Heidi Klum and Sofía Vergara with the late Elvis Presley. The group shares with PEOPLE that
                          "the first time we saw people react in the audition" was their most notable moment thus far. "We
                          realized, 'Wow, people are here for this,' and that was a magical moment," they say, adding that
                          doing the show has only heightened their "appreciation for what we do to be able to show the
                          combination of the technology with entertainment." "We do an amazing performance and it goes viral
                          and the crowd is there and we can feel and see the impact that we're making every two weeks," they
                          continue. "That's pretty incredible for a team of people working really hard." If they win, their
                          initial plan is to take a nap, but then get right back to focusing on the work. "We're working on
                          some fantastic projects, some really interesting technology to help empower individuals to become
                          their own hyperreal selves in the metaverse and beyond," they explain. "It's a marathon, not a
                          sprint, and we're at the beginning." The Lebanese female dance troupe immediately caught the
                          judges' attention, with Vergara awarding them with her Golden Buzzer.

                          Her rise to power at the head of the party she founded has been meteoric, but Giorgia Meloni has
                          been politically active since she was a teenage activist in a neo-fascist party's youth wing in
                          Rome. Now at 45 she has accepted the role of Italy's first female prime minister, although she has
                          picked a government in which only one in four ministers are women. Meloni has come to power partly
                          by fortune. Her Brothers of Italy party was one of very few that chose not to join Mario Draghi's
                          national unity government and she became a solitary opposition voice. Although she has led her
                          party for 10 years, her experience in government is limited to a spell as Italy's youngest minister

                          grew, in particular between Berlusconi and Meloni, whom Berlusconi described as "patronising,

                          Her rise to power at the head of the party she founded has been meteoric, but Giorgia Meloni has
                          been politically active since she was a teenage activist in a neo-fascist party's youth wing in
                          Rome. Now at 45 she has accepted the role of Italy's first female prime minister, although she has
                          picked a government in which only one in four ministers are women. Meloni has come to power partly
                          by fortune. Her Brothers of Italy party was one of very few that chose not to join Mario Draghi's
                          national unity government and she became a solitary opposition voice. Although she has led her
                          party for 10 years, her experience in government is limited to a spell as Italy's youngest minister

                          injuries with their clubs. Davies, 29, is expected to be out for around three weeks after suffering
                          his injury in Spurs' Champions League defeat by Sporting Lisbon. Allen came off in Swansea's 3-0

                          international break because, with the national team, he is not available. "But I think after the
                          international break, he will be available for us." Allen, 32, missed the start of the season with a

                          Here’s how it works Home / Features / Google Pixel Watch 2: the features we want from a smartwatch
                          successor The first Pixel Watch was a solid start - but there's room for improvement Android fans
                          had a lot to like about the Google Pixel Watch when it landed in October 2022: a minimal design,
                          slick Fitbit integration, and the best version of the firm’s Wear OS software to date. Google’s
                          first wearable effort wasn’t perfect, though. Battery life was a real downer, and the “one size
                          fits all” approach was off-kilter with the rest of the smartwatch world. That leaves plenty of
                          areas for a Pixel Watch 2 to improve upon. At the time of writing there’s still a fairly long wait
                          before a successor is set to turn up – but that doesn’t mean we can’t look to the future, or come
                          up with a laundry list of things we’d like to see make the cut by the time it does. Google hasn’t
                          said anything official about a second Pixel Watch. At the annual I/O event in May 2023, it quickly
                          breezed over WearOS to leave more time to focus on AI, coding and other upcoming hardware like the
                          Pixel Fold smartphone. The only info we have to go on right now is a single tweet from prolific
                          phone leaker EVleaks.

                          Representatives, was assassinated on 8 July 2022 while speaking at a political event outside
                          Yamato-Saidaiji Station in Nara City, Nara Prefecture, Japan.[3][4][5] While delivering a campaign
                          speech for a Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) candidate, he was shot from behind at close range by a
                          man with an improvised firearm.[1] Abe was transported by a medical helicopter to Nara Medical
                          University Hospital in Kashihara, where he was pronounced dead.[6] Leaders from many nations
                          expressed shock and dismay at Abe's assassination,[7] which was the first of a former Japanese
                          prime minister since Saitō Makoto and Takahashi Korekiyo during the February 26 incident in
                          1936.[8] Prime Minister Kishida decided to hold a state funeral for Abe on 27 September.[9] The
                          suspect, 41-year-old Tetsuya Yamagami (Japanese: 山上 徹也), was arrested at the scene for attempted
                          murder; the charge was later upgraded to murder after Abe was pronounced dead. Yamagami told
                          investigators that he had shot Abe in relation to a grudge he held against the Unification Church
                          (UC), to which Abe and his family had political ties, over his mother's bankruptcy in 2002.

                          82][3][83] At 2:45 pm, a press conference was held by Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, who stated that
                          Abe was in critical condition and that "doctors [were] doing everything they [could]".[84] Abe's
                          wife Akie arrived at the hospital at 4:55 pm.[85] Despite doctors' efforts, Abe was pronounced dead
                          at the hospital at 5:03 pm, around five and a half hours after being shot.[6][86][87] He was 67
                          years old. Hidetada Fukushima, a doctor at the hospital, said the cause of Abe's death was blood
                          loss, despite four hours of blood transfusions that saw the administration of 100 units of
                          blood.[b][89][90] Fukushima said that Abe was hit by two bullets[91] and that one bullet was not
                          found in Abe's body.[92] The police autopsy concluded Abe died from loss of blood after a bullet
                          damaged an artery under his collarbone.[93] Several hours after the assassination, both former
                          prime minister Yoshihide Suga[94] and Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno visited the hospital
                          where Abe's body was being held.[95] The body was subject to a judicial autopsy and departed from
                          the hospital with Abe's widow at 5:55 a.m. on 9 July.

                          suspect, 41-year-old Tetsuya Yamagami (Japanese: 山上 徹也), was arrested at the scene for attempted
                          murder; the charge was later upgraded to murder after Abe was pronounced dead. Yamagami told
                          investigators that he had shot Abe in relation to a grudge he held against the Unification Church
                          (UC), to which Abe and his family had political ties, over his mother's bankruptcy in 2002.

                          Former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe died on Friday after being shot while giving a campaign
                          speech on a street in central Japan. The assassination of the former world leader in broad daylight
                          has shocked a nation not used to gun violence and prompted an outpouring of support and condolences
                          from the international community. Abe died from excessive bleeding and was pronounced dead at 5:03
                          p.m. local time, doctors at the Nara Medical University hospital said during a news conference on
                          Friday. The doctors said the bullet that killed the former Japanese leader was “deep enough to
                          reach his heart” and a team of 20 medical professionals were unable to stop the bleeding. Abe went
                          into cardiopulmonary arrest at the site of the shooting and was rushed to hospital in a state of
                          cardiac arrest at 12:20 p.m. local time, doctors said. During surgery, doctors discovered a gunshot
                          wound to his neck and a large wound on his heart. The suspect, Tetsuya Yamagami, was detained at
                          the scene and admitted to shooting Abe, according to Nara Nishi police. Japan's strict gun laws
                          make shootings rare Abe, 67, was the former Liberal Democratic Party leader and Japan’s

  - Source              :
                          (Yoshikazu Tsuno/Pool Photo via AP) TOKYO (AP) — Japan’s assassinated hawkish former leader, Shinzo
                          Abe, was given a rare state funeral Tuesday full of military pomp and surrounded by throngs of
                          mourners as well as by widespread protests, with thousands taking to the streets in opposition.
                          Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said the publicly financed ceremony was a well-deserved honor for
                          Japan’s longest-serving modern political leader. The event was attended by U.S. Vice President
                          Kamala Harris, Japanese Crown Prince Akishino and other foreign and Japanese dignitaries. Japan’s
                          main political opposition parties boycotted the funeral, which critics say was a reminder of how
                          prewar imperialist governments used state funerals to fan nationalism. The government maintains
                          that the ceremony was not meant to force anyone to honor Abe. But the decision to give him the rare
                          honor — which was made without parliamentary debate or approval — as well as the funeral’s high
                          cost and other controversies have led to anger about the event. The funeral began with Abe’s widow,
                          Akie Abe, in a black formal kimono, walking slowly behind Kishida into the funeral venue, carrying
                          an urn in a wooden box wrapped in a purple cloth with gold stripes. Soldiers in white uniforms took
                          Abe’s ashes and placed them on a pedestal filled with white and yellow chrysanthemums and
                          decorations.

                          the third season would be the last, and that it was always the plan to have the show end after
                          three seasons. "Derry Girls is a coming of age story...a love letter to the place I come from and
                          the people who shaped me," McGee said, also commenting it was an honor to write the show, and she
                          was proud of what it had accomplished and achieved. The show premiered in the UK and Ireland in
                          January 2018 and on Netflix in December 2018. The first season garnered praise among critics and
                          fans, holding a 100% Certified Fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and the second season holding a 97%
                          Certified Fresh rating.

                          If season 3 follows the same pattern, we can expect it to land around September 2022. Season 1,
                          though, didn't land on Netflix till December 21, 2018, after finishing in the UK on February 2018.
                          Here's hoping the gap isn't that long. And considering just how highly-anticipated the new series
                          is, Netflix will likely want to tighten that gap. As for a Netflix UK release date, that's less
                          clear – season 2 isn't streaming on the platform at all, so it doesn't seem season 3 will be,
                          either. Derry Girls will likely remain an All4 exclusive. While Netflix has yet to confirm when
                          Derry Girls season 3 will arrive on the platform, those in the UK can watch the entirety of the
                          season – including the 65-minute special episode 'The Agreement' – for free via All4. Found

                          surprised the industry — even some internal Fox staffers, who had expected to see Gary Newman

                          Walt Disney Company was complete. Newman has been atop the Fox network as Fox TV Group chairman
                          with Dana Walden since 2014, and has run 20th Century Fox TV with Walden since 1999. The exec had
                          been a part of 21st Century Fox and its predecessor News Corp. for more than two decades, but he’ll
                          now depart by the end of the year when the merger is completed. Even before Friday’s announcement,
                          Newman’s nearly 20-year partnership with Walden was set to finish by the end of December, as Walden
                          has been named chairman of Disney TV Studios and ABC Entertainment. Newman had been in talks to
                          stick around at New Fox and guide the network’s transition as staffers adjusted to being a part of
                          a smaller company without a studio sibling.

                          The 2022 Japanese Grand Prix (officially known as the Formula 1 Honda Japanese Grand Prix 2022) was
                          a Formula One motor race held on 9 October 2022 at the Suzuka International Racing Course in
                          Suzuka, Japan. Max Verstappen secured his second World Championship title after finishing first, in
                          front of Sergio Pérez and Charles Leclerc. Despite only 28 of the scheduled 53 laps being
                          completed, full points were awarded due to a loophole in the regulations regarding how points
                          should be allocated, with the rules stating that reduced points should only be awarded in shortened
                          races that end under red flag conditions. As this race ended under green flag conditions, this
                          system was not applied. The wording of the sporting regulations was subsequently amended for 2023,
                          so races that do not reach the 75 percent distance are awarded shortened race points regardless of

                          national anthem.[12] The race started at 14:00 local time on 9 October 2022 under torrential rain
                          (which was the reason for so many incidents in the race) and was red-flagged on lap 2 after Ferrari
                          driver Carlos Sainz Jr. lost control into the hairpin of the opening lap and aquaplaned into the
                          barriers. A recovery vehicle was immediately dispatched, with several drivers passing the tractor
                          at speed under double-yellow flags on the second lap.[13] Alex Albon also retired due a collision
                          with Kevin Magnussen which caused damage to his radiator.[14] The race resumed at 16:15 local time
                          behind the safety car. Only twenty-eight laps were completed before the race was curtailed due to
                          it passing the three-hour time limit, with Verstappen taking his twelfth victory of the season.
                          Leclerc, who finished second on track, was given a five-second penalty for cutting the final
                          chicane whist defending from Pérez in third, which demoted him to third behind Pérez. The win meant
                          that Verstappen took the Championship title, leading Pérez by 113 points, with 112 points still
                          available.

                          The 2022 Japanese Grand Prix (officially known as the Formula 1 Honda Japanese Grand Prix 2022) was
                          a Formula One motor race held on 9 October 2022 at the Suzuka International Racing Course in
                          Suzuka, Japan. Max Verstappen secured his second World Championship title after finishing first, in
                          front of Sergio Pérez and Charles Leclerc. Despite only 28 of the scheduled 53 laps being
                          completed, full points were awarded due to a loophole in the regulations regarding how points
                          should be allocated, with the rules stating that reduced points should only be awarded in shortened
                          races that end under red flag conditions. As this race ended under green flag conditions, this
                          system was not applied. The wording of the sporting regulations was subsequently amended for 2023,
                          so races that do not reach the 75 percent distance are awarded shortened race points regardless of
                          whether a race finishes under red or green flag conditions. The event was held across the weekend

                          characteristics. In full ray-traced games, the RTX 4090 with DLSS 3 is up to 4x faster compared to
                          last generation’s RTX 3090 Ti with DLSS 2. It is also up to 2x faster in today’s games while
                          maintaining the same 450W power consumption. It features 76 billion transistors, 16,384 CUDA® cores

                          get rid of it, the 4090 thrives, and it’s still a catch at MSRP. Considering the vast chasm of
                          performance between the two, the 4090 remains a better deal if caught at the recommended price of
                          $1,600, however expensive that might be.

                          Principal photography was set take place in the San Francisco Bay area and New York City that
                          summer.[9] The Great Recession caused a delay production and by April 2009 filming was expected to
                          start in Winnipeg.[10] Two Lagoons and Astra Blue Media were then attached to co-produce, along
                          with additional cast members of Mira Sorvino, Kevin Pollak, James Caan and Smokey Robinson.[10] By
                          July 2014, some cast members had been replaced.[11] Wood Harris replaced Simmons as Nat Clifton,
                          Nathan Lane would play Saperstein and James Caan as Ned Irish.[12] Brian Dennehy, Patrick Warburton
                          and Ludacris were all attached to star in undisclosed roles. The production budget was reported to
                          be $10 million and filming was expected to begin in New York in late 2014.[11] Production was
                          subsequently completed by October 2022, with Pollak as Saperstein, Dreyfuss as Maurice Podoloff,
                          Cary Elwes as Irish, Jeremy Piven as Joe Lapchick. Gary Clark Jr and Bobby Portis make cameos.[5]
                          Guigui and Jeff Cardoni composed the film's score.[13] Sweetwater was released by Briarcliff

                          A terrific choice for the subject of a biopic, with a story as strong as his, Sweetwater looks
                          unmissable for any fans of basketball and beyond. Of course, any great biopic must have a strong
                          lead, and also a strong ensemble cast to hold the movie together. Starring as Nat Clifton in this
                          film is Everett Osborne (Chicago Fire), a terrific casting choice due to him being a former
                          professional basketball player himself. Joining Osborne on screen are the likes of Cary Elwes (Saw)
                          as Ned Irish, Eric Roberts (The Dark Knight) as Judd, Richard Dreyfuss (Jaws) as Maurice Podoloff,
                          Jeremy Piven (Entourage) as Joe Lapchick, and Robert Ri'chard (Coach Carter). Also appearing are
                          former Harlem Globetrotter Kevin Daley, blues musician Gary Clark Jr., and Milwaukee Bucks power
                          forward and center Bobby Portis, alongside Jim Meskimen (Brooklyn Nine-Nine) With a strong cast
                          list and a tale that will resonate thematically due to its subject relevance and truthful nature,
                          Sweetwater looks like one of the best sports biopics to take to our screens in 2023.

Question 186              : When did the Google Pixel Watch start sell?
Correct Answers         :  
                          October 13, Oct 13, Oct. 13, 13 October, 13 Oct, 13 Oct.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prediction (only positive):
  - Answer              : October 13, 2022
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          This makes the Pixel Watch a bit more affordable than the Apple Watch Series 8 ($399) but pricier
                          than the Galaxy Watch 5 ($279) and recently-released Fitbit Sense 2 ($299). (See the rest of the
                          differences between the Google Pixel Watch vs. Fitbit Sense 2.) The Pixel Watch release date was
                          October 13, 2022, and since then we're continuing to track the best Pixel Watch deals. Note that
                          the Pixel Watch launched alongside the Google Pixel 7 and Google Pixel 7 Pro, which would both make
                          ideal companion devices for the company's smartwatch. The Google Pixel Watch is a simple-looking
                          smartwatch, I might even call it minimalistic. It comes in just one size: 41mm. Those with larger
                          wrists might complain about the lack of a larger option; that said, it fit me perfectly. The face
                          features a rounded design with a 3D glass dome. This raised effect distracts from the display's
                          thick bezel, but doesn't change the fact that a good chunk of the display is unusable. Perhaps my
                          prior experience with Samsung watches is to blame? I can't help but think it's a missed opportunity
                          to incorporate in digital rotating bezel in that space. It seems like no mistake that the Pixel
                          Watch is a "dark mode" device. The interface and all of Google's watch faces have black backgrounds
                          to further conceal the bezel.

                          Prospect Park Alliance and NYC Parks announced today that longtime… January 18, 2023 Morgan Monaco,
                          the new Prospect Park Alliance President and Park Administrator has a long history in the parks
                          world and a storied record of leadership in support of her community. Most recently, Monaco served
                          as Executive Director of the Red Hook Initiative, a youth and community development nonprofit
                          impacting the 6,500 residents of the Red Hook Houses, Brooklyn’s largest public housing
                          development. Earlier in her career, Monaco served two tenures at the New York City Department of
                          Parks and Recreation, first as Director of the MillionTreesNYC Initiative and later as Director of
                          Stewardship for Forestry, Horticulture and Natural Resources. Monaco began her career at
                          StoryCorps, a national oral history project designed to build connections between people and share
                          the stories of Americans from all backgrounds and beliefs. Monaco currently lives in Windsor
                          Terrace, Brooklyn and her family is an avid user of Prospect Park. As she begins the new role and
                          leads Brooklyn’s Backyard into its next chapter, we chatted with Monaco about her vision for the
                          future of the park, favorite spots and more. What are you most looking forward to as you begin your
                          role? I am most looking forward to learning more about everything the Prospect Park team, both NYC
                          Parks and Alliance staff, does to maintain and sustain Brooklyn’s Backyard.

                          Prospect Park Alliance and NYC Parks announced today that longtime… January 18, 2023 Morgan Monaco,
                          the new Prospect Park Alliance President and Park Administrator has a long history in the parks
                          world and a storied record of leadership in support of her community. Most recently, Monaco served
                          as Executive Director of the Red Hook Initiative, a youth and community development nonprofit
                          impacting the 6,500 residents of the Red Hook Houses, Brooklyn’s largest public housing
                          development. Earlier in her career, Monaco served two tenures at the New York City Department of
                          Parks and Recreation, first as Director of the MillionTreesNYC Initiative and later as Director of
                          Stewardship for Forestry, Horticulture and Natural Resources. Monaco began her career at
                          StoryCorps, a national oral history project designed to build connections between people and share
                          the stories of Americans from all backgrounds and beliefs. Monaco currently lives in Windsor
                          Terrace, Brooklyn and her family is an avid user of Prospect Park. As she begins the new role and
                          leads Brooklyn’s Backyard into its next chapter, we chatted with Monaco about her vision for the
                          future of the park, favorite spots and more. What are you most looking forward to as you begin your
                          role? I am most looking forward to learning more about everything the Prospect Park team, both NYC
                          Parks and Alliance staff, does to maintain and sustain Brooklyn’s Backyard.

                          In the most significant deal that the Northern Ireland games industry has seen to date, Derry-based
                          studio Hypixel Studios has been bought by games industry giant Riot Games. The past year has been
                          fantastic for the Northern Ireland games industry, with Northern Ireland Screen's Pixel Mill game
                          development accelerator taking off, Belfast-based studio Italic Pig signing a major publishing
                          deal, and other local wins. Those achievements were dwarfed this week by the announcement that
                          Derry-based studio Hypixel Studios has been officially acquired by industry giant Riot Games. Riot
                          Games is known for its hugely successful global MOBA League of Legends, which took the esports
                          scene by storm and now packs out stadiums each year for its world championship finals. Its upcoming
                          first-person shooter Valorant is also expected to have a similar esports presence, with competitive
                          tournaments eventually reaching millions of pounds in prize money. Hypixel Studios was founded in
                          2018 with support from Riot Games and other investors, and has now been officially bought by the
                          company. The studio is currently developing an upcoming block-based exploration game called Hytale
                          that combines the creative sandbox elements of global hit Minecraft with the gameplay depth of a
                          roleplaying game. Hytale has already had over 2.5 million signups for its impending beta release
                          and the trailer has been watched by millions of people around the world. As a result of the
                          acquisition, Hypixel has announced plans to create its new headquarters in Derry and has begun a
                          recruitment drive for a range of jobs.

                          By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor After two straight quarters of subscriber losses, Netflix
                          returned to growth in the third quarter of 2022 — and told investors it’s expecting a strong Q4 to
                          finish the year, even though it doesn’t expect big gains right away from the launch of its cheaper,
                          ad-supported plans. The streaming giant reported 2.41 million net new paid subscribers in Q3,
                          including a gain of 100,000 in the U.S./Canada region, to stand at 223.1 million worldwide as of
                          the end of September. That handily topped Netflix’s previous forecast of a 1 million pickup for the
                          period. For Q4, Netflix expects to gain 4.5 million new streaming customers, compared with 8.3
                          million in the year-earlier quarter. Netflix Basic With Ads is slated to launch in the U.S. on Nov.
                          3 and priced at $6.99 per month — three dollars less than the regular Basic plan. Similar ad tiers
                          are also coming next month to 11 other countries: Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany,

                          This was rejected as Williams did not like it, but he also did not want to repeat a plot sequence
                          that had been done during the Greek games. The emotion and main hook of Ragnarök's actual story
                          were also missing in this proposed idea, and the actual ending worked better for what they wanted
                          to do, which was to say that prophecy and fate are not predetermined.[39] Williams also said that
                          there would likely not be a story-based expansion pack post-launch.[40] On July 6, 2022, a new
                          cinematic trailer was unveiled, which confirmed a worldwide release date of November 9, 2022.[41]
                          Another trailer was shown during Sony's 2022 State of Play event on September 13, and it was
                          confirmed that just like the 2018 installment, Ragnarök was done in one shot.[42] Additionally, the
                          game supports options for players to run the game in either higher resolution or better
                          performance, including 4K resolution at 30 frames per second (fps), 1080p resolution at 60fps, a
                          high frame resolution mode in 4K at 40fps, and a high frame performance mode that syncs to 120
                          hertz. The latter two high frame options are only available for the PS5 version and require
                          monitors with HDMI 2.1.

Question 196              : Who is the new prime minister of the United Kingdom?
Correct Answers         :  
                          Rishi Sunak
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prediction (only positive):
  - Answer              : Liz Truss
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          Liz Truss will be the next prime minister of the United Kingdom after winning most votes in the
                          Conservative Party leadership contest, succeeding Boris Johnson who resigned in July after a series
                          of scandals. Truss defeated rival Rishi Sunak with 81,326 votes to 60,399 among party members and
                          will take over as leader on Tuesday, as Britons face mounting economic and social crisis. She
                          pledged action to tackle the crisis in a short victory speech at a conference center in London on
                          Monday. Without offering details, Truss promised a “bold plan” to cut taxes and build economic
                          growth, and “deliver on the energy crisis, dealing with people’s energy bills but also dealing with
                          the long-term issues we have on energy supply.” Monday’s announcement ends weeks of bitter
                          campaigning during which Sunak, the former Chancellor of the Exchequer (finance minister), accused
                          the Foreign Secretary of risking a prolonged recession if she goes ahead with her promised tax
                          cuts. Once Johnson formally resigns his post to the Queen on Tuesday, Truss will also visit the
                          monarch at her Scottish residence Balmoral, where, as leader of the largest party in parliament,
                          she will be invited to form a government. 15 and counting: The Queen prepares to appoint her newest
                          PM Truss had been the frontrunner for weeks, and the 47-year-old will now follow Margaret Thatcher
                          and Theresa May to become Britain’s third female premier.

                          Before the Brexit referendum, Truss said that she was “backing remain as I believe it is in
                          Britain’s economic interest and means we can focus on vital economic and social reform at home.”
                          Cabinet colleagues at the time say that she never voiced any issue about supporting staying in the
                          EU, despite having ample opportunities to express her own Euroskepticism. These days, Truss is more
                          than happy to pick fights with Brussels and to claim that it was the EU all along that held the
                          British economy back. Truss will take over a Conservative government that is facing multiple crises
                          in the country. With steep rises in energy and food prices, long waiting lists for hospital
                          treatment, and public sector workers, dock workers and even lawyers going on strike, making the
                          case that the party deserves to win a historic fifth term at the next general election – due to be
                          called by December 2024 at the latest – will be an uphill battle. Inflation rose above 10% in July
                          for the first time in 40 years, driven largely by the rising cost of energy, food and fuel.
                          According to a forecast by the Bank of England, inflation will soar to 13% by the end of the year.
                          The central bank also predicted that the UK would enter into recession before the end of the year.
                          And on Monday, in a signal of these serious challenges ahead, the British pound dropped 0.

                          (born May 12, 1980, Southampton, England), British politician and financier who became leader of
                          the Conservative Party and prime minster of the United Kingdom in October 2022. Previously he
                          served as chancellor of the Exchequer (2020–22). Sunak was born into a family with immigrant roots.
                          His grandparents emigrated from Punjab, in northwestern India, to East Africa, where his mother and
                          father were born in Tanzania and Kenya, respectively. They met and married after their families
                          migrated in the 1960s to Southampton in southern England. Sunak’s father became a general
                          practitioner for the National Health Service. His mother, a pharmacist, owned and operated a small
                          pharmacy, for which Sunak, the eldest of their three children, would eventually keep the books.
                          Later, during his political career, Sunak would draw parallels between his experiences working in
                          the family business and the values he gained from them and those of Conservative Party icon
                          Margaret Thatcher, the daughter of a grocer. As a result of his parents’ sacrifices and saving to
                          fund his education, Sunak was able to attend Winchester College, the exclusive private school that
                          has produced no fewer than six chancellors of the Exchequer.

                          Like many of you, I find Netflix occupies my television screen about once every two weeks since I’m
                          not champing at the bit to experience a litany of identical documentaries focused on minor Twitter
                          story lines from the previous year. (Seriously, how the hell are there two GameStonk
                          documentaries?) In short, Netflix isn’t something I want to spend $240 on each year anymore — its
                          salad days are a distant memory — and the company is finally starting to empathize with my
                          reasoning. Basic With Ads is functionally identical to Netflix’s $10 Basic plan. You’re capped at a
                          720p resolution for all of your playback options and are allowed to use only one device on the
                          subscription at a time. (So no, you can’t engineer some sort of weird multi-apartment Bridgerton
                          marathon.) The only sacrifice you need to make to get the $3 discount is to sit through the four
                          minutes of total advertising time that occupied, say, season one, episode two of Stranger Things,
                          which I fired up on my Roku for a test-drive. (Yes, I’m a little late to the Upside Down party.)
                          The first thing I saw on my television was a dewy, luxurious promo for Louis Vuitton, which frankly
                          read as a pointed barb to my newfound money-saving mind-set. Yes, Netflix believes that even those
                          pivoting to Basic With Ads can afford the good life.

                          the controversy surrounding Prince Andrew—fans of The Crown have been anticipating a season set in

                          It’s the type of series that may make you second-guess any of your intended vacation plans. 2022
                          was truly the year when the wealthy were held accountable, at least in movies and television.
                          Between Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery, White Noise, and Triangle of Sadness, we got a ton of
                          great content that forced the upper class to have traumatic vacations. The pinnacle of this was the
                          second season of The White Lotus, which moved the miniseries to a luxurious new location in Italy.
                          Unfortunately for the characters, this had more in common with the Italian scenery of The Talented
                          Mr. Ripley than it did with Under The Tuscan Sun. As with the first season, the end of this trip is
                          teased at the very beginning, and it’s a violent one. Both seasons of The White Lotus take place at
                          individual locations in a luxury vacation resort chain. A multitude of guests (most of whom are
                          incredibly wealthy) interact with the staff and local residents, only to begin squabbling and
                          bringing up past issues. While the show’s brilliance stems from the inventive storytelling of
                          writer/director Mike White, it doesn’t hurt that the show has the budget and scale of an HBO
                          production. In order to make the series as authentic as possible, White and his production team
                          utilized several real locations in both seasons. The White Lotus has drawn critical acclaim due to
                          how close its satire feels to reality, and the believability extends to the filming locations
                          themselves.

                          November 12 that the Democratic caucus would retain control of the Senate in the 118th United
                          States Congress.[6][7] Initially expected to be one of the most widely contested elections in the
                          nation, Kelly amassed a massive fundraising advantage over Masters, raising a record $75 million
                          dollars, compared to Masters's $12 million.[67] Due to the Supreme Court's ruling to overturn Roe
                          Vs. Wade, which gave states the right to ban abortion, Kelly spent heavily attacking Masters over
                          his anti abortion stance, which was seen as hurting Masters especially among women voters. He also
                          attacked Masters's support for privatizing social security, as Arizona has many retired seniors
                          whom use the program. Masters's belief that the 2020 presidential election was stolen also hurt him
                          among voters.[68] With the limited amount of money he had, Masters attempted to portray Kelly as
                          weak on illegal immigration, supportive of spending programs that caused inflation, and too
                          supportive of President Joe Biden. In the final weeks of the campaign, Republican groups began to
                          increase the amount of money they were spending on the race, and many news outlets moved the race
                          from Lean Democrat to tossup. However, in the end Kelly relatively easily defeated Masters, which
                          helped to allow Democrats to retain the Senate.[69] W Withdrawn Kelly won 5 out of 9 congressional
                          districts, including two that elected Republicans.[126]

                          Copyright 2023 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. Control of the U.S. Congress remained
                          hanging in the balance on Wednesday morning as Democrats have shown surprising strength, defying
                          expectations and defeating Republicans in a series of competitive races. (Nov. 9) WASHINGTON (AP) —
                          Republicans inched closer to a narrow House majority Wednesday, while control of the Senate hinged
                          on a few tight races in a midterm election that defied expectations of sweeping conservative
                          victories driven by frustration over inflation and President Joe Biden’s leadership. Either party
                          could secure a Senate majority with wins in both Nevada and Arizona — where the races were too
                          early to call. But there was a strong possibility that, for the second time in two years, the
                          Senate majority could come down to a runoff in Georgia next month, with Democratic Sen. Raphael
                          Warnock and Herschel Walker failing to earn enough votes to win outright. In the House, Republicans
                          on Wednesday night were within a dozen seats of the 218 needed to take control, while Democrats
                          kept seats in districts from Virginia to Pennsylvania to Kansas and many West Coast contests were
                          still too early to call. In a particularly symbolic victory for the GOP, Sean Patrick Maloney of
                          New York, the House Democratic campaign chief, lost his bid for a sixth term. Control of Congress
                          will decide how the next two years of Biden’s term play out, and whether he is able to achieve more
                          of his agenda or will see it blocked by a new GOP majority.

                          but the senate race is not. The Nevada Election Survey Project 2022 general election poll, which
                          asked nearly 600 likely Nevada voters about their voting intentions and views on state and national
                          officials, found 52% of Nevadans plan to vote for Cortez Masto, 39% for Adam Laxalt and 5% remain
                          undecided. Cortez Masto’s large lead reflects less Republican voter enthusiasm for Laxalt’s
                          candidacy compared to Joe Lombardo and other Republican candidates. Among likely Republican voters,
                          74% said they planned to support Laxalt, compared to 83% for Lombardo and 88% for their Republican
                          House of Representatives candidate. More Republicans also plan to support Cortez Masto than other
                          Democrats on the ballot. Even if this sample of Nevadans is unusually supportive of the incumbent
                          senator, lower support among any likely Republican voters for Laxalt, in what others have polled as
                          a very tight race, is noteworthy.

  - Source              :
                          "Lullaby" is a song by English rock band the Cure from their eighth studio album, Disintegration
                          (1989). Released as a single on 10 April 1989, the song is the band's highest-charting single in
                          their home country, reaching number five on the UK Singles Chart. It additionally reached number
                          three in West Germany and Ireland while becoming a top-10 hit in several other European countries
                          and New Zealand. The music video, directed by Tim Pope, won the British Video of the Year at the
                          1990 Brit Awards. The meaning of "Lullaby" has been speculated by fans, including as a metonymy for
                          addiction, depression, or sexual assault,[2] and Smith has offered multiple explanations as to its
                          theme or content, such as childhood nightmares or abuse.[2] One explanation by Smith follows that
                          the song is about the disturbing songs his father sung to him as a kid, and the horrible ending
                          they would always have.[3] Tim Pope, a long-time collaborator of the Cure on many of its music
                          videos, interprets "Lullaby" as an allegory for lead singer Robert Smith's drug-addled past.[4]
                          Upon its release, "Lullaby" became the Cure's highest-charting hit in their home country when it
                          reached number five on the UK Singles Chart. It remains their only single to reach the top five in
                          the United Kingdom.

  - Source              :
                          The TARDIS has a new passenger. The BBC announced today that actress Millie Gibson has been cast on
                          the British science fiction show Doctor Who as the titular time-traveler's new companion, or
                          partner-in-adventures, Ruby Sunday. Gibson, 18, will star opposite Ncuti Gatwa, who is playing the
                          Fifteenth Doctor. Gibson will make her debut on the show over the 2023 Christmas season. Her
                          previous credits include the long-running British soap opera Coronation Street. "Whilst still being
                          in total disbelief, I am beyond honored to be cast as the Doctor's companion," Gibson said in a
                          statement. "It is a gift of a role, and a dream come true, and I will do everything to try and fill
                          the boots the fellow companions have travelled in before me. And what better way to do that than
                          being by the fabulous Ncuti Gatwa's side, I just can't wait to get started." "Millie just is the
                          companion," said Gatwa. "She is full of talent, strength, she has a cheeky sparkle in her eye and
                          is sharp as a razor. From the moment she walked into the room she captured all of our attention
                          with her effervescence and then solidified that attention with the sheer torque of her talent. This
                          adventure is going to be so wild and so fun, I cannot wait to sail the universe with Millie!

                          "It's the great honor of my job to find the next generation of talent, and Millie shines like a
                          star already," said showrunner Russell T. Davies. "She's brilliant, dynamic, clever and a wonderful
                          actor. As a Coronation Street fan, I've seen Millie survive chases, guns and sieges, but that's
                          nothing compared to what lies ahead for Ruby Sunday." Ahead of Gibson's arrival, three new Doctor
                          Who episodes will screen in November with former Doctor Who star David Tennant returning to portray
                          the Fourteenth Doctor. The trio of shows will mark the 60th anniversary of the series. Tennant

  - Source              :
                          John Barrowman's was the first non-hetero character to appear in the series and was a big hit with
                          audiences due to his no-nonsense approach to adventuring. This led to him returning multiple times
                          throughout the series after his initial departure and also becoming the lead in the hugely popular
                          spin-off series, Torchwood. Martha Jones joined the show just before Rose's departure and is with
                          the Doctor for some of his lowest points. Her unrequited feelings for him were a bit of a
                          distraction at times, but they did at least lead to some real personal growth. She really blossoms
                          into her role as a companion over time, demonstrating plenty of heroic qualities along the way.
                          After all memory of the Doctor is erased by the Master's paradox machine, it is Martha, together
                          with Jack and the rest of the resistance, who de-ages the Gallifreyan and helps to free the planet
                          from the Master's rule. With the earth once again safe, Martha bids farewell to her time-traveling
                          life and settles down with Rose's ex-boyfriend, Mickey. Barbara and Ian were the first of several
                          companion couples as well as the first companions to travel with the Doctor against their will. The
                          former teachers accidentally find themselves inside the TARDIS after following Susan home one day
                          and soon find themselves in the year 100,000 BCE.

                          Doha, Qatar on Friday afternoon. Placed in the second-seeded pot, the USA will play against
                          England, Iran and the winner of the European play-off, which will be between Wales and the winner
                          of the Ukraine - Scotland match, which is still to be organized due to the invasion of Ukraine by
                          Russia. England are the first seeds in the group, the USA second, with Iran third and
                          Ukraine/Scotland/Wales coming out of pot four. The World Cup starts this year on November 21 and

                          & Reporter Nebraska Public Media Nov. 26, 2022, 10 a.m. · Matt Rhule will be the next Nebraska
                          football head coach. Athletic Director Trev Alberts made the announcement Saturday morning,
                          following Nebraska's close win over the Iowa Hawkeyes Friday. Rhule signed an 8-year contract to
                          take over the struggling Nebraska football program. He will be formally introduced in a news
                          conference Monday at Memorial Stadium. In a news release Saturday morning, Alberts pointed to
                          Rhule's record at Temple University and Baylor University as "evidence of Rhule's ability to build
                          a program and made him an ideal fit at Nebraska." Rhule was most recently the head coach for the
                          NFL Carolina Panthers team, where he was released after a 1-4 start. He's credited for improving
                          the football programs at both Baylor and Temple while serving as a head coach. While coaching at
                          Temple from 2013 to 2016, Rhule and the Owls won 28 games. The head coach took the Owls from a
                          2-win season in 2013 to racking up a 10-4 record in 2015. In his last season with Temple, Rhule led
                          the team to a 10-3 record and an American Athletic Conference championship — the first football
                          conference title in 49 years for the school.

                          following Nebraska's close win over the Iowa Hawkeyes Friday. Rhule signed an 8-year contract to
                          take over the struggling Nebraska football program. He will be formally introduced in a news
                          conference Monday at Memorial Stadium. In a news release Saturday morning, Alberts pointed to
                          Rhule's record at Temple University and Baylor University as "evidence of Rhule's ability to build
                          a program and made him an ideal fit at Nebraska." Rhule was most recently the head coach for the
                          NFL Carolina Panthers team, where he was released after a 1-4 start. He's credited for improving
                          the football programs at both Baylor and Temple while serving as a head coach. While coaching at
                          Temple from 2013 to 2016, Rhule and the Owls won 28 games. The head coach took the Owls from a
                          2-win season in 2013 to racking up a 10-4 record in 2015. In his last season with Temple, Rhule led
                          the team to a 10-3 record and an American Athletic Conference championship — the first football
                          conference title in 49 years for the school.

                          Beat on 91.5 FM in Ontario. She also made a major reveal this month: She’s the voice of TikTok’s
                          text-to-speech feature. Iconic! Callaghan confessed in her very first TikTok video. For a long time

                          the voice they had heard for so long.

                          does it. In an update, she explained that considering she is a voice actor for a living, lying
                          about something like this would be pretty bad for her career. Then Callaghan gave the people what

                          June 2022 was the first month in which Labour Force Survey (LFS) year-over-year wage growth
                          exceeded 5% since comparable data became available in 1997, other than during parts of 2020 and
                          2021, when average wages were impacted by large pandemic-related changes in the composition of
                          employment (not seasonally adjusted). The proportion of workers who have hybrid arrangements—that
                          is, who usually work both at home and in a location other than home—rose by 0.4 percentage points
                          to 9.4% in November, continuing a gradual upward trend since the beginning of 2022. The proportion
                          of workers who usually work exclusively at home (15.6%) was little changed in November (population
                          aged 15 to 69, not seasonally adjusted). The unemployment rate declined by 0.1 percentage points to
                          5.1% in November. This was the second decrease in three months, edging the rate closer to the
                          record low of 4.9% observed in June and July. The adjusted unemployment rate—which includes people
                          who wanted a job but did not look for one—was little changed at 7.0% in November. The participation
                          rate fell 0.1 percentage points to 64.8% in November. The rate has hovered around the same level
                          since July, and the November rate was 0.6 percentage points below the most recent high of 65.

                          Cup ranked #1 and cruised to the top spot in its group. But its star Neymar was injured in Brazil's
                          opening match with Serbia – his return for the knockout round is still an open question. With or
                          without Neymar, Brazil will be a heavy favorite over their opponent South Korea, which snuck into
                          the Round of 16 with a stunning (and delightful) upset Friday over Portugal. South Korea's Premier
                          League forward Hwang Hee-chan came into the crucial game as a substitute after missing the first
                          two matches with a hamstring injury; his sneaky stoppage time goal sent his team through. Morocco

                          after the final in Qatar on Sunday. Here is what you need to know about their route to the title: *
                          The top two in each World Cup group advance to the last 16. The knockout rounds, which began on
                          Dec. 3, feature one-off matches, which can go to extra time and penalties to decide the winners. *

                          Poland to finish as winners of Group C. * Lionel Messi and Julian Alvarez scored in Argentina's 2-1
                          win over Australia in their Round of 16 tie. * Argentina beat the Netherlands 4-3 in a penalty
                          shootout in their quarter-final tie, after Nahuel Molina and Messi's goals were cancelled out by a
                          brace from Dutch substitute Wout Weghorst. * Argentina beat Croatia 3-0 in the semi-finals, with
                          Messi coolly putting away a spot kick in the 34th minute to open the scoring before Alvarez found
                          the net either side of halftime.

                          The 2014 World Cup winners have many young players in their squad. Hansi Flick’s arrival is
                          definitely an upgrade but the players are taking time to adapt to his style of play. Nonetheless,
                          it will be an interesting match because Germany have players like Sane, Gnabry, Muller and even
                          Gotze with them. Besides Argentina, Brazil are the most favoured candidates to win the 2022 FIFA
                          World Cup. It would not be surprising to see Brazil defeat Argentina as well. Brazil lost to
                          Argentina in the Copa America final and ever since then, they are unbeaten in 15 matches. Brazil
                          have failed to make it past three Quarter-Finals over the past four World Cups. Neymar, Brazil’s
                          star player is key for all of their fixtures. The PSG superstar is in great form and is arguably
                          the most essential player for Brazil in the 2022 FIFA World Cup. If Argentina do face Brazil in the
                          Semi-finals, surely Neymar and Messi will play a prominent role to win the match for their home
                          nation. This will surely be one of the best matches in the 2022 FIFA World Cup if it happens. For

                          development based on its many toy brands, 14 of which have been announced, including one based on
                          Polly Pocket toys. It follows the success of Greta Gerwig’s Barbie, which recently landed in
                          cinemas to rave reviews and outperformed all expectations, breaking box office records for the most
                          commercially successful movie by a female director. In addition to an epic marketing campaign and
                          Gerwig's feminist premise, the film's success also comes down to its brilliant cast led by Margot
                          Robbie and Ryan Gosling as the stereotypical Barbie and Ken in the flick. Robbie and Gosling are
                          joined by a huge supporting cast of Barbies from all kinds of different professions, including Emma
                          Mackey, Alexandra Shipp, Dua Lipa and Issa Rae, as well as their trusty sidekick Kens! So, who else
                          appears as the other versions of Barbie and Ken? Read on for everything you need to know about the
                          cast and characters of Greta Gerwig's upcoming movie Barbie. Sign up to get alerts for movie news,

                          Barbie had originally been in the works in 2015 with Oscar-winning Juno screenwriter Diablo Cody
                          before it moved to Amy Schumer in 2016 who was set to star and co-write. She dropped out in 2017
                          and later said: “They definitely didn’t want to do it the way I wanted to do it, the only way I was
                          interested in doing it.” It was then set to star Anne Hathaway before it finally went to Robbie,
                          who asked Gerwig to get involved. The film is set to be followed by another Mattel adaptation, a
                          take on Polly Pocket written and directed by Lena Dunham and starring Lily Collins. Dunham
                          confirmed in October she is still working on the script. Other Mattel films in development include
                          Masters of the Universe and Hot Wheels. Gerwig made her directorial debut with Lady Bird, which
                          earned five Oscar nominations before she brought a new adaptation of Little Women in 2019, which
                          garnered six Oscar nods. Robbie’s latest film, Babylon, co-starring Brad Pitt, hits cinemas this
                          month and she will be next seen in Wes Anderson’s Asteroid City alongside Tom Hanks, Scarlett
                          Johansson and Tilda Swinton. Barbie is set to land in cinemas in July 2023.

                          performance didn’t end with victory likely hurts Adams deeply. “I want to be a winner, I’m very

                          pensions, President Biden announced $36 billion for the Central States Pension Fund, preventing
                          drastic cuts to the hard-earned pensions of over 350,000 union workers and retirees. These workers
                          paid into the fund for years or even decades, and faced cuts through no fault of their own.
                          Approved by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, this is the largest ever award of federal
                          financial support for worker and retiree pension security and the largest award from the American
                          Rescue Plan’s Special Financial Assistance Program. Known as the “Butch Lewis Act” – named after
                          the heroic Ohio union leader and pension advocate – this program provides security for more than
                          200 distressed multiemployer pension plans, helping to ensure 2 to 3 million workers’ pension plans
                          remain solvent and pay full benefits through at least 2051. Ensuring that workers and their
                          families enjoy the retirement security they earned through a lifetime of work is a central part of
                          President Biden’s economic plan.

                          pensions, President Biden announced $36 billion for the Central States Pension Fund, preventing
                          drastic cuts to the hard-earned pensions of over 350,000 union workers and retirees. These workers
                          paid into the fund for years or even decades, and faced cuts through no fault of their own.
                          Approved by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, this is the largest ever award of federal
                          financial support for worker and retiree pension security and the largest award from the American
                          Rescue Plan’s Special Financial Assistance Program. Known as the “Butch Lewis Act” – named after
                          the heroic Ohio union leader and pension advocate – this program provides security for more than
                          200 distressed multiemployer pension plans, helping to ensure 2 to 3 million workers’ pension plans
                          remain solvent and pay full benefits through at least 2051. Ensuring that workers and their
                          families enjoy the retirement security they earned through a lifetime of work is a central part of
                          President Biden’s economic plan.

Question 223              : Who won the Maxwell Award 2022 in college football?

                          NCAAF 47 USC quarterback Caleb Williams won the 2022 Maxwell Award on Thursday, given to the best
                          player in college football. Here’s what you need to know: Williams was the best quarterback in
                          America this season, so the Maxwell Award was deserved. Williams led USC’s turnaround from a
                          four-win team to a top-10 squad in 2022 and elevated the players around him. Now his sights turn to
                          Saturday night and the Heisman Trophy. — Morales Duggan’s story has been one of the best in college
                          football, starting TCU’s season as the backup quarterback before leading the Horned Frogs to a 12-0
                          start. His toughness and perseverance helped pull the Frogs out of multiple second-half deficits
                          and without his poise, leadership and production late in games, TCU wouldn’t be in the College
                          Football Playoff. Winning the O’Brien and being a Heisman finalist are both well-deserved honors

                          dreams of the Arab world alive as they eliminated fancied Spain in a penalty shootout on Tuesday to
                          reach the quarter-finals. In doing so, they became the first Arab nation to advance to the last
                          eight, ensuring a breakthrough for the region in the first global tournament in the Middle East,
                          and also became the fourth African side to go this far in World Cup history. Their victory will be
                          seen as not only a triumph for Morocco but vindication of the controversial FIFA decision to hand
                          Qatar the hosting rights, adding significant gloss to another Arab success at the tournament like
                          Saudi Arabia beating Argentina and Tunisia upsetting holders France in the group phase. Morocco,

                          action, now have a chance to become both the Arab world and Africa's first-ever semi-finalists if

                          of the World Cup and all did so in painful fashion. Cameroon became the first African side to make
                          the last eight in Italy in 1990. They stunned defending champions Argentina in the tournament’s
                          opening game at the San Siro and that momentum saw them go on and top a group also containing
                          Romania and the Soviet Union. They then beat Colombia 2-1 in extra time in the round of 16, with a
                          38-year-old Milla scoring a brace to sink the South Americans. With the continent in dreamland, the
                          Indomitable Lions took on England in the quarter-finals. David Platt scored for England in the
                          first half, before Emmanuel Kunde equalised from the spot in the 61st minute. Four minutes later
                          Eugene Ekeke gave Cameroon the lead and the world was 25 minutes from a first African
                          semi-finalist. However, Gary Lineker equalised from the penalty spot and then won it in extra time
                          with another penalty. Cameroon were out but had taken a continent on the journey of a lifetime.
                          Advertisement Senegal followed in Cameroon’s footsteps in 2002 in South Korea and Japan — in more
                          ways than one. They beat the defending champions (France) in the tournament’s opening game on their

                          <strong data-cart-timer="" role="text"></strong> (WASHINGTON)—The John F. Kennedy Center for the
                          Performing Arts will present the 24th Mark Twain Prize for American Humor to Adam Sandler on March
                          19, 2023 in the Kennedy Center Concert Hall. The Prize, which is named to honor one of the world’s
                          greatest humorists, will be awarded at a gala performance featuring some of the biggest names in
                          comedy. Broadcast details will be announced at a later date. The Mark Twain Prize for American
                          Humor recognizes individuals who have had an impact on American society in ways similar to the
                          distinguished 19th-century novelist and essayist Samuel Clemens, best known as Mark Twain. As a
                          social commentator, satirist, and creator of characters, Clemens was a fearless observer of
                          society, who startled many while delighting and informing many more with his uncompromising
                          perspective on social injustice and personal folly. “Adam Sandler has entertained audiences for
                          over three decades with his films, music, and his tenure as a fan favorite cast member on SNL,”
                          said Kennedy Center President Deborah F. Rutter about this year’s recipient. “Adam has created
                          characters that have made us laugh, cry, and cry from laughing. I am looking forward to a
                          laughter-filled evening like no other as we celebrate his career at a ceremony that is sure to
                          bring together the best in comedy.

Question 228              : Who is the new president of the NCAA?
Correct Answers         :  
                          Charlie Baker
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prediction (only positive):
  - Answer              : Charlie Baker
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          By Michael McCann Legal Analyst and Senior Sports Legal Reporter Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker,
                          the newly named president of the NCAA, will take the reins from Mark Emmert in March at a time when
                          the organization and its controversial system of amateurism face existential crises. Baker, a
                          Harvard graduate who played basketball for the Crimson, was elected in 2014 and reelected in 2018.
                          He previously served as CEO of Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates. A popular Republican in a
                          heavily Democratic state, Baker is regarded as a fiscally conservative, socially progressive
                          consensus-builder who is pragmatic and open to reforms and different ideas. That skill set will be
                          helpful as Baker faces daunting challenges at the NCAA. One major issue will be developing an
                          enforceable and lawful policy on name, image and likeness. Under Emmert’s leadership, the NCAA
                          hastily adopted an interim NIL policy in June 2021, days before a set of state NIL statutes were
                          set to go into effect that made it illegal for the NCAA and member schools to punish college
                          athletes for using their right of publicity to sign endorsement deals and enter into sponsorships.
                          The NCAA had hoped Congress would pass a federal NIL bill that would have contained an antitrust
                          exemption, but no bill even made it out of committee. To date, members of Congress have viewed NIL
                          in disparate ways.

  - Answer              : Dan Gavitt
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          As many platitudes as former Indiana president Myles Brand received, he failed to act early in the
                          Ed O'Bannon case. That cost the NCAA dearly in the courts and in the court of public opinion.
                          Emmert -- a former chancellor at LSU and president at Washington -- was just the wrong choice. He
                          was detached and arrogant. He could not lead or build consensus. He was the absolute opposite of
                          what a CEO in any big company must be. The NCAA Board of Governors can't make the same mistake
                          again. The presidential model hasn't worked. That said, it could. There are some names out there
                          who have made it part of their career to be deeply involved in athletics. More than that, they've
                          shown an ability to build consensus. Emmert never had that. Let's take a look at the top candidates
                          to replace Emmert. 1. Dan Gavitt, NCAA senior vice president for basketball: If he's interested,
                          Gavitt has to be the No. 1 candidate. Right now, the NCAA does one thing really well -- putting on
                          its basketball tournaments. Gavitt runs those events tournament. He has the demeanor and the mutual
                          respect to inject some credibility back into the president's office. Yes, he is in Emmert's inner
                          circle, but he has thrived on his own despite that link. The argument can be made Emmert lasted
                          this long because of Gavitt's expertise.

                          140] On July 31, 2014, Twitter announced that it had acquired a small password-security startup
                          called Mitro.[141] On October 29, 2014, Twitter announced a new partnership with IBM. The
                          partnership was intended to help businesses use Twitter data to understand their customers,
                          businesses and other trends.[142] On February 11, 2015, Twitter announced that it had acquired
                          Niche, an advertising network for social media stars, founded by Rob Fishman and Darren
                          Lachtman.[143] The acquisition price was reportedly $50 million.[144] Twitter announced that it had
                          acquired TellApart, a commerce ads tech firm, with $532 million stock.[145][146] In June 2016,
                          Twitter [147] acquired an artificial intelligence startup called Magic Pony for $150
                          million.[148][149] On January 26, 2021, Twitter acquired Revue, an email newsletter service to
                          compete with platforms like Substack.[131] In November and December 2021, Twitter acquired and
                          immediately shut down two competitors: threader.app, a service to transform Twitter threads into
                          accessible web pages, and Quill, a messaging service.[150] Threader.app users were directed to
                          instead purchase the Twitter Blue service, which at the time was available only in some
                          countries.[151] As chief executive officer, Dorsey saw the startup through two rounds of capital
                          funding by the venture capitalists who backed the company.

                          "Throughout my career, I have sought to build disruptive and innovative platforms that provide
                          long-term value to consumers," Alegre told CoinDesk. "Web3 presents an opportunity to reinvent how
                          content is used, transacted and owned across the globe." In a press release, Yuga Labs said Alegre
                          "brings deep expertise in areas that are critical to Yuga’s ambitions for an immersive Web3 world."
                          Alegre will replace Nicole Muniz, who joined Yuga Labs as CEO in September 2021. Muniz will stay on
                          as a partner and strategic adviser. Under Muniz, the company has grown its portfolio of
                          non-fungible token (NFT) projects, acquiring Meebits and CryptoPunks from Larva Labs in March and
                          Beeple’s Web3 ecosystem WENEW and its flagship NFT project, 10KTF, last month. In March, Yuga Labs
                          raised $450 million led by venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), reaching a $4 billion
                          valuation. Read more: Empire of the Bored Apes Announcing his departure from Activision Blizzard on
                          Friday, Alegre said he was "very proud of the exceptional work and dedication" the teams at the
                          company brought to the gaming space.

                          These allegations led to a lawsuit being filed by the California Department of Fair Employment and
                          Housing against Activision Blizzard in July 2021. The company has also faced criticism for its
                          handling of the situation and the toxic work environment that allegedly exists within the company.
                          This has resulted in significant public backlash, with some fans and employees calling for boycotts
                          and protests. Alegre’s departure from Activision to Yuga Labs may be seen as a positive move for
                          those who are critical of Activision’s leadership and culture. It’s worth noting that the gaming
                          industry and the NFT space have both been the subject of intense scrutiny and controversy in recent
                          years. The allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination at Activision Blizzard have been a
                          particularly significant source of controversy in the gaming industry. Meanwhile, the NFT space has
                          faced criticism for its environmental impact and the high levels of speculation and price
                          volatility surrounding some NFTs. Furthermore, the recent fake news surrounding Bored Ape Yacht
                          Club (BAYC) highlights the need for responsible and informed reporting in the NFT space. Given
                          these issues, the appointment of Alegre as Yuga Labs’ CEO marks an interesting new phase for the
                          company. As Yuga Labs continues to expand its presence in the NFT gaming space, it will be
                          important for the company to navigate these complex issues with transparency and responsibility.

Question 231              : How much did Avatar: The Way of Water earn in its debut weekend at U.S.?

                          Water” collected $134 million in its North American box office debut, affirming the public’s
                          interest in Pandora and providing a needed boost to beleaguered movie theaters. Overseas, the
                          sci-fi epic brought in $301 million, bringing its global tally to a sizable $435 million. Those
                          ticket sales mark the third-biggest global opening weekend in pandemic times, following “Doctor
                          Strange in the Multiverse of Madness” ($442 million globally) and “Spider-Man: No Way Home” ($600
                          million globally). At the domestic box office, “Avatar 2” tied with “The Batman” to land the
                          fifth-biggest opening of the year. The follow-up film landed behind expectations, which pegged
                          initial numbers closer to $150 million to $175 million. Yet Cameron’s films, which have raked in
                          billions at the box office, often start slower and build over time. Disney, which holds the rights
                          to “Avatar” after acquiring 20th Century Fox in 2019, hopes that’s the case again; “The Way of

                          film needs to become one of the top-grossing releases in history to break even and justify its
                          massive price tag.

                          productivity software, collaboration and cloud-based services, starting on January 30. Called
                          Microsoft 365 Basic and priced at $1.99 per month or $19.99 per year, the plan will initially
                          include 100 GB of storage, Outlook email and access to support experts for help with Microsoft 365
                          and Windows 11. Existing OneDrive 100 GB subscribers will be transitioned to Microsoft 365 Basic
                          beginning January 30 as well, Microsoft says. And in the coming months, Microsoft 365 Basic plan
                          members will get “advanced security features” like ransomware recovery and password-protected
                          sharing links in OneDrive. Importantly, Microsoft 365 Basic is not replacing the free Microsoft 365
                          tier. That’s here to stay, along with the same benefits it offers today, including access to the
                          web-based versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, Outlook, OneDrive, Clipchamp and more, and
                          5 GB of cloud storage. Microsoft 365 Personal, meanwhile, will remain $6.99 per month or $69.99 per

                          details: The story tells of a peaceful colony on the edge of the galaxy that is threatened by the
                          armies of a tyrannical regent named Belisarius. Desperate, the colonists dispatch a young woman

                          Netflix will probably share some set photos, teasers, and first looks later this year after
                          production starts. According to the new exclusive first look from Vanity Fair, after Zack Snyder
                          handed in a 172-page script, Netflix realized they would have a three-hour movie and decided
                          against that. Snyder was told to trim it down, but instead he offered to make two films. Now his
                          upcoming epic will be told across two movies and each one will receive a “Snyder Cut,” a term
                          popularized by his fans after the re-releases of his films Batman v Superman and Justice League.

                          Asatryan Published on January 18th, 2023, 8:00 am EST Picture: Netflix Zack Snyder is teaming up
                          with Netflix to produce and direct two major sci-fi movies: Rebel Moon Part 1 and Part 2. The new
                          movie(s) is described as an epic sci-fi adventure compared with Star Wars in scope and scale.
                          Here’s an updated look at what we can expect from Rebel Moon which is now confirmed to arrive on
                          Netflix in December 2023. Zack Snyder will direct and co-write the film and will reunite with many
                          of his colleagues from past projects. The script for Rebel Moon will be co-written by Shay Hatten,
                          who co-wrote Army of the Dead, and Kurt Johnstad, who worked on 300 with Snyder. The Stone Quarry
                          is the main production company behind the movie with Grand Electric also listed, which is Eric
                          Newman’s production company that has an overall deal with Netflix. Snyder commented on the
                          inspiration for Rebel Moon in his THR interview: “This is me growing up as an Akira Kurosawa fan, a
                          Star Wars fan. It’s my love of sci-fi and a giant adventure.” @Netflix Let's go! https://t.

                          written by James Vanderbilt and Guy Busick. It is the sequel to Scream (2022) and the sixth
                          installment in the Scream film series. The film stars Melissa Barrera, Jenna Ortega, Jasmin Savoy
                          Brown, Mason Gooding, Hayden Panettiere, and Courteney Cox, all reprising their roles from previous

Question 241              : What was the annual GDP growth rate of the U.S. economy in 2022?
Correct Answers         :  
                          2.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prediction (only positive):
  - Answer              : 2.1 percent
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          7 percent in the third quarter. GDP for 2022 Real GDP increased 2.1 percent in 2022 (from the 2021
                          annual level to the 2022 annual level), compared with an increase of 5.9 percent in 2021 (table 1).
                          The increase in real GDP in 2022 primarily reflected increases in consumer spending, exports,
                          private inventory investment, and nonresidential fixed investment that were partly offset by
                          decreases in residential fixed investment and federal government spending. Imports increased (table
                          2). The increase in consumer spending reflected an increase in services that was partly offset by a
                          decrease in goods. Within services, the increase was led by "other" services (mainly international
                          travel), food services and accommodations, and health care. The decrease in goods primarily
                          reflected decreases in food and beverages as well as motor vehicles and parts that were partly
                          offset by increases in recreational goods and vehicles and "other" nondurable goods (mainly
                          pharmaceuticals). The increase in exports reflected increases in both goods and services. The
                          increase in private inventory investment primarily reflected increases in manufacturing, wholesale
                          trade, and retail trade industries. The increase in nonresidential fixed investment reflected
                          increases in intellectual property products (led by software) and in equipment (led by information
                          processing equipment) that were partly offset by a decrease in structures (led by commercial and
                          health care as well as power and communication structures).

                          reached 5.5 percent in 2021, a value significantly higher than the 1.2 percent rate in 2020. CBO
                          projects that inflation in the PCE price index will be 4.0 percent in 2022, thus remaining
                          elevated. Growth in the core PCE price index, which excludes food and energy prices (because they
                          tend to be volatile), rose from 1.4 percent in 2020 to 4.6 percent in 2021. The agency projects

                          the target range for the federal funds rate in 2022 and 2023. In CBO’s projections, the interest
                          rate on 3-month Treasury bills rises in concert with that increase. The interest rate on 10-year
                          Treasury notes is expected to increase through 2028, in part because short-term interest rates are
                          expected to rise. Data sources: Congressional Budget Office; Bureau of Economic Analysis; Federal

                          7 percent in the third quarter. GDP for 2022 Real GDP increased 2.1 percent in 2022 (from the 2021
                          annual level to the 2022 annual level), compared with an increase of 5.9 percent in 2021 (table 1).
                          The increase in real GDP in 2022 primarily reflected increases in consumer spending, exports,
                          private inventory investment, and nonresidential fixed investment that were partly offset by
                          decreases in residential fixed investment and federal government spending. Imports increased (table
                          2). The increase in consumer spending reflected an increase in services that was partly offset by a
                          decrease in goods. Within services, the increase was led by "other" services (mainly international
                          travel), food services and accommodations, and health care. The decrease in goods primarily
                          reflected decreases in food and beverages as well as motor vehicles and parts that were partly
                          offset by increases in recreational goods and vehicles and "other" nondurable goods (mainly
                          pharmaceuticals). The increase in exports reflected increases in both goods and services. The
                          increase in private inventory investment primarily reflected increases in manufacturing, wholesale
                          trade, and retail trade industries. The increase in nonresidential fixed investment reflected
                          increases in intellectual property products (led by software) and in equipment (led by information
                          processing equipment) that were partly offset by a decrease in structures (led by commercial and

                          Billy Batson, played by Asher Angel. You remember Billy, a constant runaway from the Philadelphia
                          foster homes he's been forced to endure since his teen mom deserted him. Billy's foster bestie is
                          Freddy (the scene-stealing Jack Dylan Grazer), a kid on crutches with a smart mouth on him. Things

                          in a response that typified the script's "Deadpool"-lite irreverence. I'm pleased to report that

                          announced that TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew will appear before the committee to testify on TikTok’s
                          consumer privacy and data security practices, the platforms’ impact on kids, and their relationship
                          with the Chinese Communist Party. It will be Chew’s first appearance before a Congressional
                          committee. “Big Tech has increasingly become a destructive force in American society. The Energy
                          and Commerce Committee has been at the forefront of asking Big Tech CEOs – from Facebook to Twitter
                          to Google – to answer for their companies’ actions. These efforts will continue with TikTok.
                          ByteDance-owned TikTok has knowingly allowed the ability for the Chinese Communist Party to access
                          American user data. Americans deserve to know how these actions impact their privacy and data
                          security, as well as what actions TikTok is taking to keep our kids safe from online and offline
                          harms. We’ve made our concerns clear with TikTok. It is now time to continue the committee’s
                          efforts to hold Big Tech accountable by bringing TikTok before the committee to provide complete
                          and honest answers for people.” Chew will testify at a full committee hearing of the Energy and

                          content and moving it into Peacock to establish the streaming service." The Blacklist appears on
                          both NBC and Peacock, so a movie could be a way to keep the narrative going, even if the show
                          itself does end as a result of this Sunday night experiment. Speaking about the show's success in a
                          previous interview with Westchester County Tourism & Film, The Blacklist's location manager Tom
                          Scutro shared: "It's been a great run. It's hard to believe this all started in 2013. I've worked
                          on the show since we started, except for the pilot episode. We're thrilled to be returning for a
                          tenth season, which we'll start filming after Labor Day." After watching the thrilling season-nine
                          finale of The Blacklist, all fans can think about now is who will be back for season ten. We, of
                          course, expect its star/executive producer James Spader to return as criminal
                          mastermind-turned-supergrass analyst Raymond 'Red' Reddington. As for the other major players, we'd
                          also expect Donald Ressler (Diego Klattenhoff), Harold Cooper (Harry Lennix) and Dembe Zuma (Hisham
                          Tawfiq) to all make a comeback.

                          Unfortunately for the show, that unexpected nature can be a double-edged sword regarding AI trained
                          on data scraped from the Internet. According to Vice, late Sunday night, the AI-generated clone of
                          Jerry Seinfeld (called "Larry Feinberg" in the AI show) went on a brief transphobic rant. Here's a
                          transcript: There’s like 50 people here and no one is laughing. Anyone have any suggestions? I’m
                          thinking about doing a bit about how being transgender is actually a mental illness. Or how all
                          liberals are secretly gay and want to impose their will on everyone. Or something about how
                          transgender people are ruining the fabric of society. But no one is laughing, so I’m going to stop.
                          Thanks for coming out tonight. See you next time. Where’d everybody go? In a Discord post from the
                          channel's creators, the malfunction occurred because of an outage from OpenAI's higher-cost (and
                          better-behaved) text-davinci-003 model led the creators to fall back to the lower-cost (and less
                          complex) text-curie-001 model to keep the show running. "The switch to Curie was what resulted in
                          the inappropriate text being generated," wrote an admin on the show's Discord channel. "We leverage
                          OpenAI’s content moderation tools, which have worked thus far for the Davinci model, but were not
                          successful with Curie.

                          Chris Brown is not impressed with the 2023 Grammys. During music's biggest night, the rapper had
                          his eyes on the Best R&B Album category. After all, the 33-year-old was nominated alongside Mary J.
                          Blige, Robert Glasper, Lucky Daye and PJ Morton. But when Robert was announced as the winner during
                          the premiere ceremony, Chris chose to react in a series of since-deleted Instagram Stories. (For a
                          complete list of winners, click here.) "Who the f--k is Robert Glasper," he wrote on social media,
                          according to The Shade Room. "Ima keep kicking y'all ass! Respectfully." Chris concluded his
                          response by posting two more stories including a photoshopped image of himself playing the
                          harmonica, quipping, "New Level Unlocked! Harmonica Breezy." "I gotta get my skills up," he added.
                          "Ima start playing the harmonica." Chris' only nomination came from his 10th studio album, Breezy
                          (Deluxe). The body of work included features from Lil Baby, Lil Wayne, Jack Harlow, H.E.R. and
                          other artists. As for Robert's album Black Radio III, the project included musical collaborations

                          Chris Brown is not impressed with the 2023 Grammys. During music's biggest night, the rapper had
                          his eyes on the Best R&B Album category. After all, the 33-year-old was nominated alongside Mary J.
                          Blige, Robert Glasper, Lucky Daye and PJ Morton. But when Robert was announced as the winner during

                          "Ima start playing the harmonica." Chris' only nomination came from his 10th studio album, Breezy
                          (Deluxe). The body of work included features from Lil Baby, Lil Wayne, Jack Harlow, H.E.R. and
                          other artists. As for Robert's album Black Radio III, the project included musical collaborations

                          “code red” situation for its search product. On Wednesday, Google held an event in its Paris office

                          information online. Google’s event came one day after rival Microsoft announced a revamped version
                          of Bing powered by a more advanced version of the AI used by ChatGPT. (Microsoft is investing
                          billions in OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT.) In the presentation Wednesday, a Google executive
                          teased plans to use this technology to offer more complex and conversational responses to queries,

Question 250              : who founded midjourney?
Correct Answers         :

                          David Holz discussed the philosophy of Midjourney. Midjourney – an "artistic" AI-powered
                          text-to-image tool – is getting more popular every day, with the community creating awesome (and
                          often really weird) pictures on Discord. But what is Midjourney from the creator's standpoint? The
                          tool's founder David Holz answered this question in a recent interview with The Verge, talking
                          about Midjourney's art style, copyright issues, and what AI is. Midjourney creators see their tool
                          "as an engine for the imagination," "a very positive and humanistic thing." Holz answered the most
                          popular question asked by artists when they deal with such technology: won't AI replace human art
                          one day? "What does it mean when computers are better at visual imagination than 99 percent of
                          humans? That doesn’t mean we will stop imagining. Cars are faster than humans, but that doesn’t
                          mean we stopped walking. When we’re moving huge amounts of stuff over huge distances, we need
                          engines, whether that’s airplanes or boats or cars." Moreover, Midjourney is a social product with
                          its huge Discord server created because "people really like imagining together." This social
                          aspect, however, could potentially cause problems for the AI due to copyright, and while you can’t
                          copyright AI-generated art, some artists might not be happy about technology taking their unique
                          style to train on.

                          “They think that the better they can get at copying their personal art style, the more useful it
                          is. Whereas if it has its own style, they have to kind of meet it halfway and pull their stuff out
                          of it. Which is interesting. It’s a little scary for me because I see how it could be used for good
                          and evil.” As Midjourney is intended to be open by default, it has strict policies on ensuring that
                          content is PG-13. It automatically blocks text inputs that are inherently disrespectful,
                          aggressive, abusive or sexual, Holz confirmed Most importantly, the rules are enforced for all
                          content, including interactions in private mode. Midjourney currently offers a limited “freemium”
                          model that allows users to submit 20-25 prompts for image generation. After that, users can choose
                          from a range of subscription packages — ranging from a basic membership package of 200 images, a
                          standard membership, which includes unlimited images — or a premium corporate membership, which
                          includes both unlimited images and complete privacy. It’s important to note that “corporate
                          membership” does not refer to an enterprise software-as-a-service (SaaS) product. In fact, Holz
                          explicitly mentioned that the company has no interest in building one either, even though they have
                          many customers who use the product to make commercial video games, concept art and videos.

                          engine. Bing reached 100 million active users the following month. As of March 2023[update],
                          (Microsoft) Bing is the second largest search engine globally, with a query volume of 12%, behind

                          Microsoft launched MSN Search in the third quarter of 1998, using search results from Inktomi. It
                          consisted of a search engine, index, and web crawler. In early 1999, MSN Search launched a version
                          which displayed listings from Looksmart blended with results from Inktomi except for a short time
                          in 1999 when results from AltaVista were used instead. Microsoft decided to make a large investment
                          in web search by building its own web crawler for MSN Search, the index of which was updated weekly
                          and sometimes daily.

                          of its own.) Microsoft eventually plans to incorporate OpenAI’s technology into many of its

                          a foothold in search for years. If it works, it could chip away at Google’s dominance and some of
                          the more than $100 billion in annual search advertising revenue that comes with it.

                          Most recently, Bill was President of Commerce, Payments & Next Billion Users at Google. Before
                          that, he was Chief Operating Officer at PayPal, and CEO of both Braintree and Venmo. At his core,
                          Bill is a builder. He has led small startups and global organizations. He deeply understands
                          commerce and payments. And, he shares our passion for creating a positive corner on the internet—a
                          place that enriches your real life instead of distracting you from it. As you can imagine, this was
                          a hard decision. So much of my heart belongs to Pinterest. I guess you could call it a founder’s
                          love. And, when you care about something so much, the natural instinct is to hold it as tight as
                          you can. But often, the most loving thing to do is let it go and watch it flourish in new ways.
                          That’s what is going to happen with Bill at the helm. I’m not leaving. Being executive chairman
                          will let me focus on what I love: meeting Pinners, nurturing new products, and advising on
                          long-term strategy. My new role reminds me a bit of what I did in the early days. When we started
                          Pinterest, it was more art project than business. I knew most Pinners by their first name. We
                          obsessed over every pixel, feature, and word in our product. I posted my cell phone number on our
                          website to show there was a real person who cared about every user. Thank goodness for unlimited

                          Pikmin 4 is so close to lanching on the Nintendo Switch, and here's when fans can expect to jump
                          into the digital version. Pikmin 4 is set to launch for the Nintendo Switch on July 21 and marks
                          the newest numbered entry in the real-time strategy series in over ten years, making its release
                          quite the big deal for hardcore fans. Instead of playing as Captain Olimar (who most people know
                          from Super Smash Bros. at this point) or any of his space explorer comrades, gamers will get to
                          customize their own character (a series first). There are not too many options available, but it's
                          still a step forward in terms of a character creator in a Nintendo first-party title. Pikmin 4
                          comes out in a couple of days and retails for $59.99, the same price as most other major games on
                          the Switch. People who decided to pre-order the game digitally via the Switch eShop are probably
                          wondering just when they'll be able to actually boot the game and start playing --that's where this

                          providing the final ingredient for curing Oatchi. After discovering that Moss cannot be cured,

                          The Rescue Corps agree and depart with the others, while Olimar leaves with the Dolphin. Meanwhile,

                          was in development, and "very close to completion".[10][11] On July 7, 2016, Miyamoto said in an E3

                          June 19, 2017, Miyamoto reassured Eurogamer that the game was still "progressing".[13] In the years

                          September 13, 2022. Pikmin 4 was developed using Unreal Engine, its first use in an internally
                          developed Nintendo EPD game.[16]

                          Super Bowl LVII was an American football game played to determine the champion of the National
                          Football League (NFL) for the 2022 season. The American Football Conference (AFC) champion Kansas
                          City Chiefs defeated the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Philadelphia Eagles, 38–35.
                          The game was played on February 12, 2023, at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. It was the
                          fourth Super Bowl hosted by the Phoenix metropolitan area, and the third at this venue, with the
                          most recent previously being Super Bowl XLIX in 2015 (then known as University of Phoenix
                          Stadium).[6] Both teams finished the regular season with a league-best 14–3 record. This was the
                          Eagles fourth Super Bowl appearance overall and the second in the last six seasons, having
                          previously won Super Bowl LII; the Eagles previously lost Super Bowls XV and XXXIX. This was the
                          Chiefs' fifth Super Bowl appearance overall and third in the last four seasons, having previously
                          won Super Bowls IV and LIV, and losses in Super Bowls I and LV. After the Eagles went into halftime
                          up 24–14, the Chiefs mounted a comeback to win the game 38–35 with a game-winning field goal kicked
                          by Harrison Butker. Butker's game winning kick was set up by a pivotal and controversial defensive
                          holding call on Philadelphia cornerback James Bradberry, which was criticized by some observers but
                          supported by others.

                          Chiefs player in the game - that gave the Chiefs a first down on Philadelphia's 17-yard line. A
                          2-yard run by Pacheco ran the clock down to the two-minute warning. A completed pass for no gain
                          brought up third-and-8.

                          Lodge Photo: Getty Images When you stay at LeConte Lodge in Great Smoky Mountains National Park,
                          you have to work a little bit to get there. Located at 6,360 feet, LeConte Lodge can be reached by
                          guests on foot on six hiking trails. But how does the lodge get its supplies? The answer is llamas.
                          These sure-footed creatures play a key role in getting food and other supplies to the remote lodge.
                          How does the lodge get its food when there are no roads to the high-altitude perch? A train of
                          llamas has been carrying food, linens and other supplies up the lodge three times a week along the
                          Trillium Gap Trail since 1986. Prior to the llamas, horses carried the loads, but they made a
                          relatively big impact on the narrow, rocky trail. Llamas small hooves have a lighter impact on the
                          trail. Before starting their 6.7-mile climb to the lodge, the llamas eat alfalfa cubes. Led by a
                          llama wrangler, the llamas spend about four hours on trail to reach the lodge.

                          the only acting nominee to have won (twice). One of her fellow best actress nominees, Michelle
                          Williams (“The Fabelmans,”) is now a five-time Oscar nominee but is still seeking her first win.
                          The other two non-first-time nominees on the list have waited a long time for today. Angela Bassett

                          following her portrayal of Tina Turner in “What’s Love Got to do With It” at the awards in 1994.
                          And Judd Hirsch (“The Fabelmans”) got his only previous nomination in 1980, for his work in
                          “Ordinary People” — when he lost to one of his co-stars in that film, Timothy Hutton. ___ The

                          a fighter jet flown by “Top Gun: Maverick” star Tom Cruise. Cruise demanded Kimmel eject in the
                          video before the camera cut to the exterior of the Dolby, over which two jets flew over.

                          She’s scheduled to perform “Lift Me Up” from “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.” “Lift Me Up,” with
                          music by Tems, Rihanna, Ryan Coogler and Ludwig Göransson and lyrics by Tems and Ryan Coogler, is
                          nominated for original song. It is Rihanna’s first Oscar nomination. ___ Not even three months have
                          passed since Argentina celebrated one gold trophy — the World Cup, hoisted for all to see by the
                          legendary Lionel Messi. Another trophy hoist might be coming Sunday. And it, too, would prompt a
                          national celebration. Up for best international film is “Argentina, 1985,” which details how
                          prosecutors brought leaders of Argentina’s bloody 1976-1983 military dictatorship to trial. It won
                          a Golden Globe in January, which was big news in the South American nation, and now Oscar buzz
                          could be the latest reason to party. “After the World Cup win, this is an immense joy,” the film’s
                          star Ricardo Darín said in Spanish at January’s Golden Globe Awards. But it’s up against Germany’s
                          “All Quiet on the Western Front,” which was also nominated for best picture. ___ For the first
                          time, two sequels ( “Top Gun: Maverick,”“Avatar: The Way of Water” ) are nominated this year for
                          best picture. And, of course, The Slap will be revisited.

                          as the runner-up. Trae Patton, NBC During a somewhat surprising finale, “The Voice” declared the
                          Season 23 winner who will get $100,000 and a record deal. Although it was Blake Shelton’s final
                          season as a coach on the show — and two of the five singers in the finale were from Shelton’s team
                          — the winner wasn’t from Team Blake, which has more wins than any other team in “Voice” history.
                          Instead, the Season 23 victory went to singer Gina Miles, who was on “Voice” newcomer Niall Horan’s
                          team. Host Carson Daly said it marked the smallest margin of victory in the competition’s history,
                          according to “Entertainment Tonight.” Standing next to runner-up Grace West, from Shelton’s team,
                          Miles looked visibly shocked when the show called her name and declared her the winner. “It was
                          crazy, I just did not expect that,” Miles told “Entertainment Tonight” after the win. “I’m just so
                          very grateful to be here.” The 19-year-old singer added that her first order of business is to
                          catch up on sleep, eat and call her father. Horan, meanwhile, said that his relationship with Miles
                          isn’t going to end just because Season 23 of “The Voice” has concluded. “It’s tough out there.

                          Hasbro changed its paper purchasing policy, earning the company praise from Greenpeace executive

                          news for Indonesian rainforests and the people and wildlife that depend on them."[36] By April
                          2011, Hasbro started 360 Manufacturing Services, a contract OEM game manufacturing operating out of
                          Hasbro's USA plant.[37] Having been absent from the building block market since the failure of the
                          Built to Rule line, Hasbro re-entered the market with the Kre-O line in late 2011, starting with
                          some Transformers-based sets.[26] In 2012, Hasbro received a US$1.6 million tax credit from the
                          state of Rhode Island with a promise to create 245 new jobs in the state. Instead, they laid off
                          more than 125 workers. This was followed in 2013 with further layoffs of North American workers,
                          amounting to 10% of its salaried employees. Meanwhile, CEO Brian Goldner signed a new five-year
                          contract.[38][39][40] As of fiscal year 2012, Goldner had a total calculated compensation of
                          $9,684,285.

                          products segment, due mainly to shipping constraints and shipping costs. Even with that pain,
                          though, the company's revenue overall rose 11%, and operating profits were up 9%, thanks to gains
                          elsewhere in the business including its entertainment segment.

                          NBCUniversal News Group. Ferrari has stepped up with immediate effect and will report to Mark
                          Lazarus, chairman of NBCUniversal Television and Streaming. He will be tasked with carrying on the
                          good work of Conde, who led Telemundo’s rise in the prime-time Spanish-language ratings after
                          decades of dominance by Univision. Lazarus said: “Beau is a strong leader with extraordinary
                          business acumen and deep media experience across all media platforms and the Hispanic market.
                          During his three years with the company, he has made a tremendous impact as Telemundo became one of
                          NBCUniversal’s fastest-growing businesses.” Ferrari added: “It’s an incredible honor to lead the
                          talented team at Telemundo Enterprises, particularly at a time when there is so much momentum in
                          this business.” He has been Telemundo’s EVP since 2017 and prior to joining the company, held a

                          was dissolved as a company this week and was replaced by a new company Musk calls X. The move is
                          seen as an attempt to build a social media platform that also allows payments, turning it into “the
                          everything app,” akin to how apps like WeChat work in China. Twitter announced this week it was
                          partnering with eToro to allow users to be able to trade stocks and crypto. It should be pretty
                          clear by now that Musk’s call for a six-month pause was purely out of self interest in the AI arms
                          race, as I wrote at the time. ChatGPT has become a fascinating tool for people who want to
                          experiment with large language models (LLMs) that answer questions posed in natural language. But
                          there are still a lot of kinks to be worked out, as ChatGPT will often give confident answers, even
                          when it’s wrong. AI is largely a magic trick at this point, sometimes spouting nonsense that users
                          may not know enough about to fact-check. But it’s an interesting magic trick and it’s something
                          that will improved upon as more people in the world of tech become involved. Musk must know he’s
                          behind in the most exciting development on the web since social media went mainstream in the late
                          2000s. But the billionaire clearly doesn’t intend to stay behind for long.

                          9 yards per carry for the Maroon squad, running through some decent holes produced by most of the
                          first-team offensive line. “To me, that’s the one area that we had to improve in,” Pry said. “We
                          have to be able to run the football. It really helps everything else. With our offense, with our
                          defense. If we can run the ball, that to me is 100-level foundational stuff. And we’re getting
                          better there. “I think we’ve got a pretty good group up front on defense. We’ve got some old heads
                          at d-tackle that have got some weight on them, can press gaps and do things, and we were still able
                          to get some movement on them guys. So it’s a work in progress, but again, I think the O-line’s
                          improved, I think the running backs are better. I like what’s happening in that room. Still got a
                          ways to go.” Nice write up on the game and the team. Enjoyed it. thanks Mid-May should be

Question 275              : What was Sundar Pichai's total compensation in 2022?
Correct Answers         :  
                          226 million
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prediction (only positive):
  - Answer              : $226 million
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google and its parent firm Alphabet, was awarded a total compensation
                          valued at $226 million in 2022, according to a regulatory filing released by the firm last Friday.
                          This mammoth compensation includes stock awards valued at more than $200 million. google The median
                          total compensation for Google parent Alphabet's employees was $279,802 in 2022, according to the
                          filing, implying that CEO Pichai’s compensation was 808 times that amount. Someone making the
                          $15.50 minimum wage in Alphabet’s home state of California would have to work 14.6 million hours,
                          or just over 7000 years (with 40 hour work weeks and no time off) to catch up with Pichai’s 2022
                          salary. CEO Pichai had said in January that top executives, including him would get lower bonuses
                          as part of cost-cutting measures, following the largest round of layoffs in the company’s history.
                          Last month, Google’s finance chief told employees to expect more spending cuts. Amid the mass
                          layoffs, global recession fears and economic uncertainty, this mammoth compensation was a big boost
                          for CEO Pichai, who made just over $6 million in 2021 and $7.4 million in 2020. The rest of the
                          compensation besides the stock awards reportedly came from a $2 million base salary and more than
                          $5 million for a private security detail in 2022.

                          price hovering around $150 and capacity close to 100 percent. The recoupment comes a week after
                          Comer won the Tony Award for best lead actress in a play. In Prima Facie, written by Suzie Miller
                          and directed by Justin Martin, Comer plays Tessa, a young, ambitious lawyer who defends individuals
                          accused of sexual assault and then goes through the legal system herself as a victim of rape. While
                          accepting her Tony Award on stage, Comer acknowledged the responsibility she feels in taking on the
                          role. “To every person who feels represented by Tessa, this has been the greatest honor and it
                          continues to be,” she said. The play marks Comer’s Broadway debut. The Killing Eve actress played
                          the role on the West End, where she made her professional stage debut and won an Olivier Award for
                          her performance, for a run that began in April 2022. After being with the role for more than a
                          year, Comer told The Hollywood Reporter that she feels changed by the experience. “I feel like I
                          have so much more trust within myself and who I am. I realized that I was quite fearful last year
                          of a lot of things, especially in my ability to do this.

                          ambitious new Star Wars adventure is sure to pack the galaxy far, far away with unforgettable
                          characters and performances. Featuring brand new faces and returning characters from Fallen Order,
                          Star Wars Jedi Survivor is expanding this intriguing new corner of the Star Wars universe,
                          including plenty of new Star Wars Jedi Survivor enemies. We’ll walk you through the main characters
                          ahead of the Star Wars Jedi Survivor release date, as well as the cast and performers bringing them
                          to life. Here’s the full list of Star Wars Jedi Survivor cast and characters: The series’ returning
                          protagonist, Cal is still a hopeful character in Star Wars Jedi Survivor, but a little less
                          fresh-faced than in Fallen Order. Cal has been hardened by the galaxy’s fall to the empire and is
                          struggling to make a difference wherever he can. Cal is voiced by Cameron Monaghan, who previously
                          starred in Shameless and Gotha. Cal’s steadfast droid ally, BD-1 returns in Jedi Survivor to
                          provide healing and moral support to Cal in equal measure. This time around, BD-1 can be customised
                          to further aid Cal on his journey. BD-1 is performed by Ben Burtt, Sound Designer for Lucasfilm.
                          The last of Dathomir’s Nightsisters, Merrin is continuing to grow her powers and make sense of a
                          galaxy without her clan.

                          And, you know, I noticed all of the main characters - both the heroes and the villains - they are
                          women. What did you want to explore around that, by casting women as both the heroes and villains?
                          MANZOOR: You know, it's been the women who've uplifted me the most in my life, but who've also cut
                          me down the hardest. There's something about the pain of a woman critiquing another woman that
                          hurts more when - than when a man does it. CHANG: Yeah. MANZOOR: Like, you're part of - you should
                          be on my team. It just cuts deep on a whole other level. And so for me, I'm most interested of
                          seeing women - you know, the matriarch who upholds the patriarchy. And, you know, it's so exciting
                          as well to explore, like, as you say, a female villain. The dark feminine is so beautiful because
                          it's something that we have had to quash. We've had to deny. Getting to show the light and the dark
                          sitting together was really so exciting for me. CHANG: Nida Manzoor directed the new film, "Polite

                          revealed the news alongside the cancellation of Young Rock after three seasons, while no decision

                          correspondent Roy Wood Jr. may have to outlast a carousel of guest hosts in order to fill the
                          vacant hosting seat left behind by Trevor Noah, he’s about to get another chance to show the execs
                          at Comedy Central how capable he is of stepping into Noah’s shoes. On April 29, Wood will host the
                          2023 White House Correspondents’ Dinner, where he described his hosting style for the evening to be
                          “the quickest and clearest way for people to understand exactly who I am and what I believe.” He
                          will be joined by political attendees such as President Joe Biden, First Lady Jill Biden, and other

                          conversation with Vulture’s Sam Sanders, Wood gave a peak into what’s possibly to come as he steps
                          up to the podium. “I could joke about Clarence Thomas getting flown around the country like an
                          Instagram model. The whole thing could be Clarence Thomas jokes, but there’s a little bit of CRT we
                          need to get into. There’s some DeSantis versus Trump we need to get into,” he explains on this
                          week’s Into It podcast.

                          in China, we have signalled our arrival as a major power in international sport.” The IWGA
                          President added: ”Following our 2021 event in another great country, the USA, we are excited now to

                          competes for the title of Ultimate Firefighter at the World Police and Fire Games. The
                          international competition is set to come to Birmingham in 2025. The Magic City will host the World
                          Police and Fire Games (WPFG), an event featuring more than 10,000 first responders competing in
                          1,600 medal events, from June 27 to July 6, 2025. The city’s successful bid for the event was
                          announced in May by local officials and The World Police and Fire Games Federation. “From the
                          beginning, we were impressed by all that Birmingham has to offer,” said LC Collins, president of
                          the WPFG. “We believe that this city is the whole package – from its venues, infrastructure and
                          history of hosting major events, to its entertainment, dining and attractions." The decision comes
                          following a presentation to the Federation’s Board of Directors by the Birmingham Bid Committee,
                          which was led by the Greater Birmingham Convention and Visitors Bureau, the city of Birmingham and
                          Jefferson County. The games are “expected to have an economic impact of $75 million on the
                          Birmingham region and will showcase our home to over 150,000 people between athletes, supporters
                          and spectators,” said Jefferson County Commissioner Steve Ammons. Events will be hosted at more
                          than 35 venues around the city and will be free and open for all spectators.

                          For charging, the Pixel Fold supports 21W wired speeds. However, you’ll have to purchase Google’s
                          30W power adapter ($25 at Google Store) separately. The phone also supports wireless charging at up
                          to 7.5W and will work with any Qi wireless charger. No. Furthermore, the Google Pixel does not
                          support pen/stylus input. The Pixel Fold’s inner display is protected by Ultra Thin Glass, complete
                          with a protective plastic layer applied. Gorilla Glass Victus protects the external display. Yes.
                          The Google Pixel Fold has an IPX8 certification, which means it can be submerged in up to 1.5
                          meters of freshwater for up to 30 minutes. No, Google no longer includes chargers with its
                          smartphones. You’ll have to buy a compatible charger that supports USB Power Delivery PPS. The
                          Google Pixel Fold supports dual SIMs. One is a nano-SIM slot, and the second is via eSIM. The Pixel
                          Fold was announced on May 10, 2023. General availability of the phone will commence in June 2023.
                          Folding phones are great for those who want a large-screen device but don’t want the size penalty
                          of carrying a tablet. Based on our hands-on experience, the Pixel Fold should also be a great
                          traditional handset when folded. There’s no indication that Google is working on a second, smaller
                          flip phone to partner the Pixel Fold or challenge the Galaxy Z Flip series.

                          budget-friendly Pixel 7a, Google’s first folding handset is finally here. The highly-anticipated
                          Pixel Fold will compete for your attention in a quickly crowding foldable phones market of which
                          Samsung is currently king. Here’s everything you need to know about the Google Pixel Fold. Google
                          officially unveiled the Pixel Fold at Google I/O on March 10, 2023. It comes in two colors —
                          Obsidian and Porcelain. You can also choose between three official Pixel Fold cases that come in
                          Hazel, Porcelain, and Bay colors (pictured above). Google is charging a similar price to the rival
                          Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4. The 256GB variant of the Pixel Fold will cost you a whopping $1,799. The
                          512GB version is even more expensive at $1,919, which seems costly for Google’s first attempt at a
                          foldable phone. Google hopes you buy the foldable Pixel for its thin form factor, “true pocket
                          size,” loaded camera features, “all-day battery,” multi-tasking skills, and long-lasting software
                          support. However, we’ll only know if it justifies that price when we review the device. As for
                          availability, Google is not casting a very wide net for the Pixel Fold. The handset will only sell
                          in the US, UK, Germany, and Japan, at least to start with.

                          Even though it trails some of the other devices on our best phone battery life list, it's expected
                          because foldables drain more due to their larger displays. You get 30W wired charging for the Pixel
                          Fold, which is the same as the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro. And the Pixel Fold supports Qi wireless
                          charging. The Pixel Fold certainly seems like a promising entry into the foldable phones market. It
                          offers a durable and flexible hinge, a front display that looks easy to use and a premium camera
                          experience in the thinnest foldable design yet. It's also encouraging to see Google optimizing its
                          own apps for foldables and pushing developers to do the same. However, the $1,799 price will give
                          anyone pause because Google is known for undercutting Samsung and other flagships. So far after
                          testing the Pixel Fold, it's proving more to be a champ among foldables and should be in
                          consideration for the best phones this year. Instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews,

                          Google is also banking on two more conventional devices as it attempts again to make headway in the
                          hardware market. The Pixel 7a looks like last year’s Pixel 7, but uses more basic components and
                          trims back the list of features. Its screen is 25% brighter than the preceding model and has a
                          faster, 90-hertz refresh rate. There’s also face unlock, enhanced camera zoom, and a 64-megapixel
                          rear camera, making it one of the more compelling low-end smartphones. A year after announcing the
                          product, Google shared more details about its tablet. The device’s specifications — including the
                          company’s G2 processor, 128GB of storage, 8MP front and rear cameras and hardware design — are by

                          Even though it trails some of the other devices on our best phone battery life list, it's expected
                          because foldables drain more due to their larger displays. You get 30W wired charging for the Pixel
                          Fold, which is the same as the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro. And the Pixel Fold supports Qi wireless
                          charging. The Pixel Fold certainly seems like a promising entry into the foldable phones market. It
                          offers a durable and flexible hinge, a front display that looks easy to use and a premium camera
                          experience in the thinnest foldable design yet. It's also encouraging to see Google optimizing its
                          own apps for foldables and pushing developers to do the same. However, the $1,799 price will give
                          anyone pause because Google is known for undercutting Samsung and other flagships. So far after
                          testing the Pixel Fold, it's proving more to be a champ among foldables and should be in
                          consideration for the best phones this year. Instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews,

                          California state laws add six months to the federal PHE requirements on health plans to continue
                          covering COVID-19 tests, vaccines and treatment from any licensed provider (in- or out-of-network)
                          with no prior authorization or enrollee cost sharing. The federal PHE ends on May 11, 2023, and
                          state laws extend these requirements for six months through November 11, 2023. After November 11,
                          2023, enrollees can continue to access COVID-19 tests, vaccines and treatment with no prior
                          authorization or cost sharing when they access these services through their health plan’s network.
                          Health plan enrollees can be charged cost-sharing only if these services are provided out of
                          network after November 11, 2023. View the DMHC COVID-19 fact sheet for more information and
                          resources for health plan enrollees. In March 2020, at the beginning of the federal PHE, the
                          federal government required states to continue to cover every person who became eligible for
                          Medi-Cal, even if their income or other circumstances changed. This became known as the “continuous
                          coverage requirement.” This assured that low-income families, older adults, working adults,
                          children, and people with disabilities would have access to health care throughout the pandemic.

                          repurposed parts of their buildings for COVID-19 treatment or created temporary structures that
                          could be used to accept patients during a COVID-19 surge. facilities will still have the ability to
                          augment their medical surge capacity after the end of the Public Health Emergency through HCAI. For

                          WIC (Women, Infants & Children) program recipients will again be required to enroll or recertify
                          in-person to receive services. In addition, some staffing resources provided to locals related to
                          maternal, child and adolescent health will be reduced. For more information, visit the WIC website.
                          The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) anticipates the following changes will occur with
                          the end of the federal PHE: Federal rules that provided additional workforce to administer COVID-19
                          vaccination are set to end on October 1, 2024. These rules allowed, for example, pharmacy interns,
                          healthcare providers with recently expired licenses and those licensed to work only in one state to
                          give COVID-19 vaccines. There is ongoing deliberation at the federal level and in the courts in
                          this area. For more information on Healthcare Provider Flexibilities, visit the Public Health

  - Source              :
                          According to Alan Cooper, the "Father of Visual Basic", the concept of Clippit was based on a
                          "tragic misunderstanding" of research conducted at Stanford University, showing that the same part
                          of the brain in use while using a mouse or keyboard was also responsible for emotional reactions
                          while interacting with other human beings and thus is the reason people yell at their computer
                          monitors.[11] Microsoft concluded that if humans reacted to computers the same way they react to
                          other humans, it would be beneficial to include a human-like face in their software.[11] As people
                          already related to computers directly as they do with humans, the added human-like face emerged as
                          an annoying interloper distracting the user from the primary conversation.[11] First introduced in
                          Microsoft Office 97,[12] the Office Assistant was codenamed TFC during development.[13] It appeared
                          when the program determined the user could be assisted by using Office wizards, searching help, or
                          advising users on using Office features more effectively. It also presented tips and keyboard
                          shortcuts. For example, typing an address followed by "Dear" would cause the Assistant to appear
                          with the message, "It looks like you're writing a letter. Would you like help?" Microsoft turned
                          off the feature by default in Office XP.[14] The feature was removed altogether in Office 2007 and
                          Office 2008 for Mac.

  - Source              :
                          As for how Cortana goes about this work, here’s how a Microsoft spokesperson describes it: “Cortana
                          is a native component of productivity applications, including Microsoft Teams, Outlook, Microsoft
                          ToDo, and more. In productivity apps there is no need to invoke Cortana by name, but rather by
                          selecting the microphone in those applications and invoking the desired skill — for example, ‘Send
                          an email to Jan.’” Cortana’s power is most evident with the Outlook mobile app, where it does even
                          more, including finding relevant documents for you and letting you use natural-language commands
                          like “Send an email to Allison and her manager telling them I’m running late” to accomplish tasks.
                          Cortana in the Outlook mobile app will also do things such as read to you what it considers the
                          most important of your recent incoming emails. Cortana also works in concert with Teams, letting
                          you do things such as joining or ending Teams meetings and adding people to meetings. In Teams, it
                          will also help you find information relevant to your meetings by tapping into AI. Cortana can
                          perform a variety of tasks in the Teams mobile app. These may sound like humble tasks, but for
                          Kuppusamy, that’s a virtue. They may not be flashy, but they’re examples of Cortana making people’s
                          work life easier. He’s careful not to overpromise and underdeliver.

                          In the Adobe Life Blog interview, Levoy said that while his role at Google was to "democratize good
                          photography", his mission at Adobe is instead to "democratize creative photography". And that
                          involves "marrying pro controls to computational photography image processing pipelines". In other
                          words, Google and others have now taken the baton of "democratizing good photography", while
                          Adobe's programs use machine-learning power to improve the workflows of amateurs and pros who need
                          the finer craft of manual photo edits. The death of Photoshop is a long way off, then, even if many
                          of its mass market tools are being automated by phones. These are still early days in the AI photo
                          editing revolution and Google's new tools are far from the only ones out there. Desktop editors
                          like Luminar Neo, ImagenAI and Topaz Labs are all impressive AI assistants that can enhance (or
                          rescue) your imperfect photos. But Google's Photo Unblur and Magic Eraser go a step further by
                          living in our Pixel phones – and they'll surely migrate to our Google Photos libraries, too. This
                          step would really take them to a mass audience, who'll be able to turn their holiday snaps or
                          family photos into polished masterpieces without needing to know what an adjustment layer is. As
                          for Adobe and Photoshop, we'll likely see some new Sensei announcements at Adobe's Max 2022
                          conference from October 18.

                          Games can be played with Bluetooth game controllers that connect to the headset. Apple Vision Pro
                          is priced starting at $3,499 and it is set to launch in early 2024. It will be available on
                          Apple.com when it launches, and in stores only in the United States to begin with. Note: See an
                          error in this roundup or want to offer feedback? Send us an email here. Apple Vision Pro is a
                          "mixed reality" headset, meaning it can display both virtual and augmented reality content. It is
                          not like augmented reality glasses, however, as it is designed to completely cover the eyes and
                          block out all of your surroundings. Apple is using exterior and interior cameras for the augmented
                          reality component of the device. The cameras are able to map the space around you and project the
                          real world back to you, so though you're not actually looking at what's around you using
                          see-through glasses, you are effectively seeing an accurate picture of your real world environment.
                          With this capability, Apple can show you 3D windows, objects, and content in your actual space, or
                          the cameras can be turned off to shut out the world to provide an entirely virtual setting. Apple
                          is focusing on the headset's ability to allow for working, content consumption, gaming,
                          communication and other activities to be done "anywhere" with just the Vision Pro.

                          Cramer on Monday considered a new angle on Apple's divisive virtual reality headset, the Vision
                          Pro, linking the product to the ongoing battles between the most popular wireless carriers. Some
                          were shocked just a few weeks ago when Apple execs revealed the Vision Pro's price tag: at $3,500 a
                          pop, the Vision Pro is one of Apple's more expensive consumer products. Cramer noted that some
                          rationalized the steep cost by figuring Apple's Vision Pro would open the doors for less expensive
                          headsets of a similar ilk. But Cramer sees potential for major wireless carriers like Verizon,
                          T-Mobile and AT&T to capitalize on the new product by offering discounts on plans in exchange for
                          cheaper phones.

                          Games can be played with Bluetooth game controllers that connect to the headset. Apple Vision Pro
                          is priced starting at $3,499 and it is set to launch in early 2024. It will be available on
                          Apple.com when it launches, and in stores only in the United States to begin with. Note: See an
                          error in this roundup or want to offer feedback? Send us an email here. Apple Vision Pro is a
                          "mixed reality" headset, meaning it can display both virtual and augmented reality content. It is
                          not like augmented reality glasses, however, as it is designed to completely cover the eyes and
                          block out all of your surroundings. Apple is using exterior and interior cameras for the augmented
                          reality component of the device. The cameras are able to map the space around you and project the
                          real world back to you, so though you're not actually looking at what's around you using
                          see-through glasses, you are effectively seeing an accurate picture of your real world environment.
                          With this capability, Apple can show you 3D windows, objects, and content in your actual space, or
                          the cameras can be turned off to shut out the world to provide an entirely virtual setting. Apple
                          is focusing on the headset's ability to allow for working, content consumption, gaming,
                          communication and other activities to be done "anywhere" with just the Vision Pro.

Question 296              : What is the name of Apple's headset?
Correct Answers         :  
                          Vision Pro
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                          That's because Apple ditches controllers entirely with the Apple Vision Pro, instead using the
                          headset's many sensors and cameras to allow you to control the device using just your eyes, hands
                          and voice. And these intuitive controls are meant to feel natural as well. Apple says all it takes
                          is turning your head to shift the focus of the display, or a simple tap of your fingers to simulate
                          a mouse click. You can even keep your hands in a natural position rather than holding them in front
                          of you when making gestures. Glancing at a search bar and speaking will even allow you to type into
                          the search bar for easy use. Aside from these new methods of controlling the mixed reality headset,
                          there are two familiar features. First, Siri is back, giving you Apple's famous voice assistant
                          right out of the box. Second, the headset does work with a range of Bluetooth products. In addition
                          to supporting controllers like the PS5 DualSense, it also supports the Apple Magic Keyboard, Mouse
                          and Trackpad in case you don't want to rely on hand gestures or a virtual keyboard. According to
                          reports, the Apple VR/AR mixed reality headset — which we now know as the Apple Vision Pro — was
                          designed to be a precursor to Apple Glass. And now that we've officially seen the Vision Pro, it's
                          clear that Apple wanted to have a true mixed reality device rather than a VR headset.

                          sure what all the fuss is about? Amazon Prime Day is an annual two-day shopping bonanza where
                          Amazon offers some of its best deals of the year on everything from luggage and electronics to home
                          goods and shoes. Whether you've got a wish list ready or are new to the retail giant's Black
                          Friday–like deals, we've put together a quick rundown of everything you need to know to make the
                          most of this year's Amazon sale—including editor-recommended favorites to consider adding to your

                          Day, let's get you up to speed: Amazon Prime Day is an annual 48-hour event that typically happens
                          once a year, in which Amazon discounts thousands of products across every single category. Tech and
                          home sales tend to be the most popular during these events—and amount to the biggest savings—but
                          you can also score deals on clothing and shoes, luggage, beauty products, outdoor gear, and family
                          travel essentials.

                          Selected members will be notified during Prime Day with instructions on how to purchase an item at
                          its discounted price. Finally, be sure to check back in often with the Wirecutter Deals page, since
                          our team of expert deals hunters will be working around the clock to share the best deals they find
                          on Wirecutter’s expert-approved picks during Amazon Prime Day (and every other day of the year).
                          Beginning Monday, July 3, 2023, through Monday, July 10, 2023, Prime members can get a $5
                          promotional credit with the purchase of an Amazon eGift Card worth $50 or more. This is a nice
                          opportunity to save a little extra if you already plan to spend at least $50 on Prime
                          Day—especially since that $50 gift card can also be applied to your purchase. After an order is
                          placed, shoppers will receive an email with instructions for redeeming the credit (which is
                          redeemable through Friday, August 25), and their savings will reflect at checkout. There is a
                          caveat, though: This credit can be applied only to items shipped and sold by Amazon, not products
                          sold by third-party sellers or gift cards. Only current Prime members qualify for this offer. But
                          that shouldn’t be a problem, considering you also have to be a Prime member to score many of
                          Amazon’s Prime Day deals. Plus, non-members can always take advantage of this offer and of Amazon’s
                          Prime Day discounts by signing up for a 30-day free trial.

                          Some of Kupp's many achievements: Became only the second player to win the receiving triple crown,
                          NFL Offensive Player of the Year and Super Bowl MVP, joining Jerry Rice. A notable difference: Rice
                          accomplished all of those things in a whole career, while Kupp did it in one season. Set a record
                          for receptions (33) and tied for the second-most receiving yards (478) and receiving touchdowns (6)
                          in a postseason in NFL history. Caught a touchdown in each of the Rams' four postseason games,
                          making him the second player in league history to do that in a single postseason, along with former
                          Arizona Cardinals wideout Larry Fitzgerald. Joined former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Joe
                          Montana as the only players to win Offensive Player of the Year and Super Bowl MVP in the same
                          season. Became the first player to lead the league in receiving and win a Super Bowl since Rice in
                          1994. When it was over and his vision had become reality, Kupp struggled to find words on the
                          podium. Even as he sat with his son and had more time to reflect, he was still overcome by the
                          emotions of his own manifestation.
