                          The only way to resume his job is as her subordinate, an arrangement which, for him, is untenable.
                          Their interactions work, and Sophia Bush and Jason Isaacs seem like they could be a great pairing.
                          The other characters around them fail to make much of an impression, except for Sam's mother and
                          Griff's ex-wife, Vivian, who's an administrator at the hospital. Oh, and her new husband is also a
                          doctor there. Adding to the intrigue, Sam's best friend Pippa sleeps with Griff! So, yes, there are
                          some seriously intermingled lives at this hospital, and a fair number of twists in the pilot, but
                          it's not clear where the show goes from here, and/or whether CBS viewers will be invested enough in
                          its characters to care. FINAL RECOMMENDATION: Good Sam is a solid pilot script with a fair number
                          of twists. The father-daughter relationship at its heart is compelling, and Sophia Bush and Jason
                          Isaacs seem well cast. That said, it doesn't feel like it brings much new to the medical show genre
                          overall, and feels far more soapy than we've come to expect from CBS. It's not clear to me where it
                          could fit in their schedule. OVERALL PROJECT SCORE: [X] PASS [ ] CONSIDER [ ] RECOMMEND Network:

  - Answer              : Succession is delightfully selfish in their own
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          Inspired by the Karate Kid movies, Cobra Kai reunites the Karate champions Johnny Lawrence and
                          Daniel LaRusso. However, the stakes are high now as both of their children also get involved in
                          martial arts tournaments. Just like their opposite karate styles, both men seem to have different
                          approaches to parenting that are reflected in their children’s actions. RELATED: 5 Ways Johnny Is
                          Cobra Kai's Hero (& 5 It's Still Daniel) This is how Cobra Kai feels thematically similar to The
                          Good Sam. Sam wishes to walk in the professional footsteps of her father even though he has his own
                          fallacies. How she seeks to reinvent herself in this context is what adds more substance to the
                          premise. A satire on the ultra-rich sections of American society, Succession deals with the
                          internal conflicts of the Roy family. As the family's aging patriarch continues to thrive with an
                          iron fist, his children devise to take the reins of his empire. Each of the main characters on
                          Succession is delightfully selfish in their own ways. The result of their actions is a family drama
                          of Shakespearean proportions. If people think Sam Griffith is a harsh dad, they should watch Logan
                          Roy's outbursts at his children in Succession. The latter can be equally hot-headed and scheming,
                          making Succession a treat for fans of well-written family dramas.

                          The 2022 Citrus Bowl was a college football bowl game played on January 1, 2022, with kickoff at
                          1:00 p.m. EST and televised on ABC.[4] It was the 76th edition of the Citrus Bowl, and was one of
                          the 2021–22 bowl games concluding the 2021 FBS football season. Sponsored by Vrbo, a vacation
                          rental marketplace owned by the HomeAway division of Expedia, the game was officially known as the
                          VRBO Citrus Bowl. In the first meeting between the two programs, the game featured the Kentucky
                          Wildcats of the Southeastern Conference (SEC) and the Iowa Hawkeyes of the Big Ten Conference. Both
                          teams received and accepted invitations on Sunday, December 5.[5] The Wildcats entered the Citrus

                          It’s been a long time coming. Before Chris Creighton arrived as head coach in 2014, the 1987
                          California Bowl was the program’s last bowl trip. Since then, Creighton brought the Eagles to five
                          bowl games, but this year was the first time EMU pulled out the victory. With the win, EMU finished
                          9-4 for the season. That’s the second-most wins in a season in program history. Kentucky: The
                          Wildcats made sure that the Music City Bowl was going to hit the under in a 21-0 loss to Iowa. The
                          total for the game was 31 and the lowest total for a bowl game in decades. It was also the lowest
                          total of any game this season after Iowa and Minnesota had a pregame total of 31.5 in what turned
                          out to be a 13-10 game. And just like that Iowa win, this game went under too. The two teams
                          combined for fewer than 400 total yards and punted the ball 18 times with just 21 first downs
                          between them. It was as ugly as an offensive performance as we all expected, especially from
                          Kentucky. Freshman QB Destin Wade started in place of Will Levis and threw two pick sixes in the
                          second quarter. The loss drops the Wildcats to 7-6 in what ultimately is a disappointing season
                          while Iowa finishes at 8-5 despite its remarkable offensive futility throughout the season.

  - Source              :
                          Super Bowl LVI[12] was an American football game played to determine the champion of the National
                          Football League (NFL) for the 2021 season. The National Football Conference (NFC) champion Los
                          Angeles Rams defeated the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Cincinnati Bengals, 23–20.
                          The game was played on February 13, 2022, at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, the home
                          stadium of the Rams, marking the second consecutive and second overall Super Bowl with a team
                          playing and winning in its home stadium.[13][14][15][16] The Rams' victory was their second, first
                          as a Los Angeles-based team, and first since winning 1999's Super Bowl XXXIV when they were based
                          in St. Louis. Finishing with a 12–5 record, the Rams reached their fifth appearance after acquiring
                          veteran quarterback Matthew Stafford, who had not won a playoff game in his previous 12 years with
                          the Detroit Lions. The Bengals, who finished with a 10–7 record, were seeking their first Super
                          Bowl title following several decades of losing seasons and playoff struggles. They won their first
                          playoff game since 1990, ending the longest drought in the four major North American sports, en
                          route to their third Super Bowl appearance and first since 1988's Super Bowl XXIII.

                          121] This swap gave NBC the rights to both events and the network planned to maximize the
                          advertising revenue from both events (as it did for Super Bowl LII prior to the 2018
                          Olympics).[116][117][118] NBC subsequently announced in November 2021 that a block of primetime
                          coverage for the Winter Olympics would air after Super Bowl LVI in lieu of new entertainment
                          programming.[122][123] The network promoted the events under the title "Super Gold Sunday".[120]
                          NBC constructed an outdoor stage on the lake in Hollywood Park outside the stadium, from which it
                          broadcast studio programming and other sporting events being held over Super Bowl
                          week.[124][125][126] This served for both cross-promotional reasons, and due to the availability of
                          NBC Sports' headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut being constrained by the Olympics.[127] As Mike
                          Tirico was the studio host for both the NFL and the Olympics, he traveled back from Beijing
                          part-way through the Games' opening week, and briefly hosted its primetime coverage from Stamford
                          (using a redecorated version of the Football Night in America set) before flying out to Los Angeles
                          for Super Bowl weekend. Tirico then presented the Games' primetime coverage from the lakeside set,
                          before returning to Stamford after the Super Bowl.[124][128][125] Alongside NBC's presences in and
                          around SoFi Stadium, Telemundo originated a pre-game show from Plaza México in Lynwood to showcase
                          California's Latino community.[126]

                          Tehreem Hussain on February 4, 2022 in News The sculpture of the “Three Pioneers,” standing in the
                          shadow of Tech Tower in Harrison Square is a poignant reminder of the Institute’s history with
                          integration and race relations. On Sep. 27, 1961, three black students attended classes at the
                          Institute, making Tech the first higher education institution to integrate in the Deep South.
                          Peaceful integration without a court order was unprecedented at the time; black students were often
                          met with violence, and civil unrest ensued throughout college campuses across the South. In
                          recognition of their roles as trailblazers and pioneers, Tech’s first black students, Ford Greene,
                          Ralph Long Jr. and late Lawrence Williams, along with the first black graduate, Ronald Yancey, have
                          been named as the recipients of the 2022 Ivan Allen Jr. Prize for Social Courage. The Ivan Allen
                          Jr. Prize for Social Courage was established in 2010 in honor of beloved Tech alumnus and former
                          Atlanta mayor, Ivan Allen Jr. The award’s foundation is rooted in the rhetoric surrounding Tech’s
                          core principle: bettering the human condition through progress and service. Much like Mayor Allen,
                          recipients of the award have dedicated their lives to supporting a moral principle, despite risks
                          to their careers and lives.

                          war and hate".[9] The final torchbearer was four-time Chinese para-athletics gold medalist Li Duan,
                          who mounted the torch at the centre of a large snowflake sculpture.[9] The closing ceremony was

                          Super Bowl LVI[12] was an American football game played to determine the champion of the National
                          Football League (NFL) for the 2021 season. The National Football Conference (NFC) champion Los
                          Angeles Rams defeated the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Cincinnati Bengals, 23–20.
                          The game was played on February 13, 2022, at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, the home
                          stadium of the Rams, marking the second consecutive and second overall Super Bowl with a team
                          playing and winning in its home stadium.[13][14][15][16] The Rams' victory was their second, first
                          as a Los Angeles-based team, and first since winning 1999's Super Bowl XXXIV when they were based
                          in St. Louis. Finishing with a 12–5 record, the Rams reached their fifth appearance after acquiring
                          veteran quarterback Matthew Stafford, who had not won a playoff game in his previous 12 years with
                          the Detroit Lions. The Bengals, who finished with a 10–7 record, were seeking their first Super
                          Bowl title following several decades of losing seasons and playoff struggles. They won their first
                          playoff game since 1990, ending the longest drought in the four major North American sports, en
                          route to their third Super Bowl appearance and first since 1988's Super Bowl XXIII.

  - Source              :
                          By Maxim Mower Link copied Chris Stapleton picked up his sixth Male Vocalist of the Year prize at
                          the 56th Annual CMA Awards, making him the most decorated artist of all-time in this category.
                          Stapleton has now surpassed country icons such as George Strait, Vince Gill and Blake Shelton with
                          six Male Vocalist of the Year wins. In his acceptance speech, the Kentucky crooner paid tribute to
                          the other artists nominated in this year’s category, Luke Combs, Eric Church, Cody Johnson and
                          Morgan Wallen. This marks the second year in a row that Stapleton has taken home the award, and
                          consolidates the ‘You Should Probably Leave’ songsmith’s status as one of the preeminent artists of
                          the past decade. In addition to this, Stapleton took to the CMA stage for a memorable rendition of
                          ‘You’ll Never Leave Harlan Alive’ with fellow Kentuckian, Patty Loveless. The CMA Awards 2022 also
                          saw performances from artists such as Carrie Underwood, Thomas Rhett, Katy Perry, Zac Brown Band,
                          Miranda Lambert, HARDY, Lainey Wilson and more. Chris Stapleton was nominated in four other
                          categories, including Entertainer of the Year, which went to Luke Combs, and Music Video of the
                          Year, for his high-profile Taylor Swift collaboration, ‘I Bet You Think About Me (Taylor’s Version)
                          (From The Vault)’.

  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          That's in line with when Google normally holds its developers conference — last year's edition took
                          place on May 11 and May 12, for example. There will be an in-person event at the Shoreline
                          Amphitheatre in Mountain View, Calif., a venue that's just down the street from Google
                          headquarters. Most people will attend virtually, though since Google streams its developer
                          conference. The Google I/O 2023 website promises a kickoff keynote that gets underway at 1 p.m. ET/
                          10 a.m. PT/ 6 p.m. BST on May 10. A developer keynote will follow afterward, diving into more
                          detail on tools available to Google developers. You can find a full Google I/O 2013 schedule
                          listing the different presentations. The Google I/O 2023 agenda doesn't provide any specific
                          details about what's in store on May 10. But we can make some educated guesses about what's on tap,
                          given Google's past announcements and rumors about the company's current plans. Google Bard is just
                          the start of the company's grand plans for AI-powered search. According to a report in The New York
                          Times, Samsung is considering ditching Google as the default search engine for its devices in favor
                          of Bing. And Google is feverishly working on the next stage of its search engine which will
                          integrate a chatbot. Dubbed Project Magi, Google has reportedly devoted a large portion of its
                          staff to accelerating the implementation of AI into its search engine.

                          Jokes aside, Randolph, who plays Loretta's determined publicist, Beth, says she appreciated the
                          danger because she knew it would result in a different kind of film. "I was excited because it was
                          like, 'Oh, this isn't going to just be a cute rom-com,'" she says. "I was immediately confronted
                          with just how much action and how physical this was going to be. I just love that, especially as a
                          female, that I was able to do that, because sometimes they just reserve that stuff for the guys."
                          Radcliffe's villainous Fairfax is a far cry from his beloved Harry Potter. When it comes to the
                          inspiration for his spoiled antagonist, he said there's no specific person he had in mind. "I feel
                          like I've spent enough time around a certain type of incredibly entitled bratty Englishman," the
                          actor adds. "And I see one in the mirror every morning. There's stuff to pull from there, if not an
                          actual person, for sure." One scene that tested Radcliffe had him in a cave on a beach alone, while
                          cameras on boats filmed him from a long distance for hours on end. The problem, according to Adam,
                          was where Radcliffe would relieve himself. The solution? "Corner of the cave," the actor jokes,
                          prompting Bullock to suggest that'd be the title of his new book.

                          incident disrupting the momentum of the proceedings, the telecast was "one of the most uplifting,
                          groundbreaking, amazing Oscars ever".[69] The American telecast on ABC drew in an average of 16.62
                          million people over its length, which was a 60% increase from the previous year's ceremony.[2] The

                          or 77% viewers in that demographic.[2] In July 2022, the broadcast was nominated for three awards

                          aforementioned reports false,[77][78] urging the SEC to investigate Twitter's daily user
                          numbers.[79] The same day, Twitter filed new documents with the SEC, including a detailed timeline
                          of Musk's purchase,[9] and affirmed they would "enforce the merger agreement" regardless of Musk's

                          in California by manipulating the market.[84] The lawsuit further declared that Musk was not
                          permitted by the acquisition contract to place the deal on hold, and that Musk's misleading
                          statements had contributed to declining Twitter stock prices.[85][86] On June 3, the acquisition
                          was cleared by U.S. antitrust review.[87] In an email sent by Musk's attorney to Twitter three days
                          later, Musk threatened to terminate his agreement with Twitter because the company had refused to
                          give him data pertaining to its users.

                          against Tesla stock, instead opting to pledge an additional $6.25 billion in equity
                          financing.[81][82] Dorsey departed Twitter's board the same day,[83] while Twitter investor William
                          Heresniak filed a class-action lawsuit against Musk, alleging that he had violated corporate laws
                          in California by manipulating the market.[84] The lawsuit further declared that Musk was not
                          permitted by the acquisition contract to place the deal on hold, and that Musk's misleading
                          statements had contributed to declining Twitter stock prices.[85][86] On June 3, the acquisition
                          was cleared by U.S. antitrust review.[87] In an email sent by Musk's attorney to Twitter three days
                          later, Musk threatened to terminate his agreement with Twitter because the company had refused to
                          give him data pertaining to its users.

                          though her ambitions make it so difficult. She has been frank about the possible outcomes here,
                          including the fact that losing is an option that should be prepared for, one that would not be a
                          tragedy. Quite the final we have on Philippe Chatrier today, a battle between an irresistible force
                          in Iga Swiatek and irresistible charm in Coco Gauff. It’s also a battle between two members of the
                          younger generation on the women’s tour. Swiatek, the 2020 French Open champion, while Gauff is
                          still just 18, having charmed the tennis world in 2018 with her Wimbledon run. It’s her first grand
                          slam final, though she has also reached the women’s doubles final this year at Roland Garros. To
                          land the French title, Gauff must beat a player on a 34-match winning streak, going for a sixth
                          title in succession, and therefore upset the odds, though she has yet to drop a set this year in
                          Paris. This could be a classic, and three sets of tennis must be expected. We start at 2pm UK time.

                          Kudos to Karolina Muchova for putting up such a brave fight and taking Swiatek to a final set but
                          the Pole once again proved why she is the World No. 1. Presentation ceremony shortly! Muchova
                          serving to stay in the final. Swiatek attacks the wide serve with a forehand return which just
                          catches the baseline and engages Muchova in the rally. Eventually, Muchova hits a backhand lob long
                          - 0-15. Muchova overhits a forehand going for a down the line winner and she is down 0-30. Body
                          serve from Muchova, Swiatek nets the backhand return - 15-30. Chipped forehand return from Swiatek
                          to Muchova’s T serve and the Czech player hits the crosscourt forehand wide. Swiatek has two
                          championship points. What an anticlimactic end as Muchova commits a double fault! Swiatek
                          successfully defends her French Open title! A forehand going long and a backhand into the net -
                          Swiatek down 0-30 on her serve. Trouble again. Second serve from Swiatek, Muchova hits the forehand
                          return right at her and the Pole finishes the point with a forehand winner down the line - 15-30.
                          Big T serve from Swiatek, fails to finish the point with the backhand volley but Muchova sends the
                          lob return long - 30-all.

                          While he still covers the court with more flexibility and ease than most athletes at their physical
                          peak, these achievements at his age have only added another layer to his greatness. Djokovic is now
                          the oldest Roland Garros singles champion in history at 36 years and 20 days. He has also won the
                          last three grand slam tournaments he has contested – he did not travel to the US Open last year due
                          to the United States banning unvaccinated visitors – compiling a 21‑match grand slam winning run.
                          Few people gave Ruud, the fourth seed, much of a realistic chance against the third seed Djokovic,
                          but after contesting the French and US Open finals last season against Nadal and Carlos Alcaraz,
                          Ruud knew what level it would take for him to match Djokovic in a grand slam final. Ruud started
                          the match vaporising his forehand as he took an early break, while Djokovic started the match
                          poorly. He played passively while he sprayed forehands and missed overheads. The benefit of being
                          Djokovic, though, is that he always has options. He dug in and he relied on his legs as he soaked
                          up a series of stinging Ruud forehands before retrieving the early break. Still, the Norwegian kept
                          his head up. The decisive moment of the match came while he led 5-4 with Djokovic serving.

                          Elena Rybakina won the women’s singles final Wimbledon on Saturday, claiming her first grand slam
                          title and the first for Kazakhstan. Rybakina beat world No. 3 Ons Jabeur in three sets, coming from
                          a set down to win 3-6 6-2 6-2. The 23-year-old, appearing in her first grand slam final, started
                          slowly but gradually found her rhythm and powerful serve to overcome Jabeur. Rybakina, who was born
                          in Russia but has represented Kazakhstan since 2018, was the youngest women’s finalist at Wimbledon
                          since 2015 when Garbine Muguruza was 21. But at the end of an enthralling encounter, Rybakina
                          lifted the Venus Rosewater Dish aloft as she was named Wimbledon champion for the first time. In
                          her interview on court afterwards, Rybakina’s first emotion was one of relief. “I was super nervous
                          before the match, during the match and I’m happy it’s finished,” she told Sue Barker on Center
                          Court. “Really I have never felt something like this. I want to thank the crowd for the support, it
                          was unbelievable these two weeks. “But also I want to congratulate Ons for a great match and
                          everything you have achieved. I think you are an inspiration for everybody. You have an amazing

                          Markéta Vondroušová had overcome the odds throughout the last fortnight at Wimbledon and the Czech
                          did so again in the women’s final on Saturday, beating favorite Ons Jabeur to become the first
                          unseeded woman in the Open Era to win the famous tournament. The world No. 42, who was playing in
                          her second grand slam final, beat the No. 6 seed 6-4 6-4 on Centre Court to make history, falling
                          onto the grass as the enormity of her achievement hit her. Not since Serena Williams in 2018, when
                          the American was ranked 181 in the world, had a female player ranked so low in the world reached a
                          Wimbledon final. The last unseeded woman to do so was Billie Jean King in 1963. Last year
                          Vondroušová was in London as a tourist, still recovering from surgery to her left wrist. And at the
                          start of Wimbledon, seven months on from her most recent injury comeback, no one had expected her
                          to be competing in the championship match, not even the player herself whose husband had remained
                          in the Czech Republic until the final to look after their cat, Frankie.

                          victories on Friday. Alcaraz and Djokovic both flashed their dominance in straight-set wins over
                          Daniil Medvedev and Jannik Sinner. Alcaraz's win over Medvedev advanced him into his first
                          Wimbledon singles final. His only other previous major title match appearance came at the 2022 U.S.
                          Open. Djokovic reached his 35th-career Grand Slam final with his triumph over Sinner. The four-time
                          reigning Wimbledon champion has not been beaten on Centre Court in his last 45 appearances. Alcaraz
                          will try to become the first player to eliminate Djokovic since 2017 in Sunday's men's singles
                          final (9 a.m. ET, ESPN). Men's Semifinals No. 1 Carlos Alcaraz def. No. 3 Daniil Medvedev, 6-3,

                          far better player for most of his showdown with the No. 3 seed. The Spaniard made the gap in class
                          between himself and Medvedev look far steeper than it actually is on paper.

                          digits in sacks in a season? Darryl Tapp back in 2005. Unlike offense and defense, special teams
                          was always pretty good and sometimes great under Fuente. Football Outsiders ranked Tech’s special
                          teams 22nd last year and in the top 25 three times in Fuente’s six years, so the new staff isn’t
                          starting from scratch. Getting Peter Moore back at punter is a nice start. His 44.5-yard average
                          was fourth in the ACC, though Tech’s coverage unit (122nd nationally with a 13.2-yard average) has
                          lots of room for improvement. It’s everywhere else that there are question marks. With Robinson
                          gone, Blue and Lofton caught punts in the spring game, though the player who looked most
                          comfortable catching it was DJ Harvey, a big recruit from 2021 and one of the Hokies’ top
                          nickelback options. King or Black figures to be the lead option on kick returns, where Tech crept
                          back into the top 25 last year. The Hokies are starting over at kicker, with John Parker Romo off
                          to the pros. Former Coastal Carolina transfer William Ross and scholarship freshman John Love are
                          the top options. Neither has kicked in a college game yet.

                          This article was published more than 1 year ago CHARLOTTE — Virginia Tech’s Dax Hollifield was
                          speaking in glowing terms about Hokies first-year football coach Brent Pry on Thursday afternoon
                          when the senior linebacker compared him to Bud Foster, the program’s former longtime defensive
                          coordinator. Pry, who served under Foster at Virginia Tech as a graduate assistant and defensive
                          line coach from 1995 to 1997, smiled broadly in addressing the significance of having the Hokies’
                          leader on and off the field mention him in the same breath as a legend who remains beloved in
                          Blacksburg. “It’s a great compliment, and it’s not by accident, right?” Pry said during his first
                          ACC media day. “As far as defensive coach and mind-set and coaching mentality and all those things,
                          I learned so much from Bud those three years. Three years is a pretty good run, especially when
                          you’re a sponge and you’re a young coach and you’re just soaking up everything.” ACC commissioner
                          says league is trying to close gap with Big Ten and SEC Pry parlayed the knowledge he gained from
                          Foster into a successful career as an assistant, most recently serving as Penn State’s defensive
                          coordinator since 2014 before undertaking the assignment of overhauling the program at Virginia
                          Tech on the heels of Justin Fuente’s departure. Unlike his predecessor, Pry has made himself
                          accessible in the community, following the model established under Frank Beamer, the program
                          architect who turned Virginia Tech into a national power.

                          My own view is that algorithmic stablecoins should be treated separately from fiat/asset backed
                          stablecoins,” he said, adding, “But let’s be clear: Terra was very large, and when something that
                          large can collapse, the natural inclination of a regulator is to look out across the field to see
                          what other similar instruments and products are there, and the dangers that may arise.” Given the
                          current state of cryptocurrency markets, it’s notable that many ecosystem participants remained
                          optimistic about the future. In particular, Austin’s cryptocurrency community appears to be
                          thriving, as it has become a hot spot for crypto mining companies and a number of Web3 projects.
                          Patrick Stanley, core contributor to City Coins — the cryptocurrency project that has been
                          implemented in New York State and Miami — told Cointelegraph that AustinCoin (ATX) can be activated
                          at any time, noting that there is a group currently working on a proposal for getting new CityCoins
                          up and running. “We want to be more deliberate about launching AustinCoin. We already have people
                          on the ground in Austin, we have the capital, and there is clear commitment. We just want to ensure
                          all of this before activating AustinCoin.” Stanley added that Austin Mayor Steve Adler is a
                          “cryptocurrency progressive,” noting that he understands that CityCoins leaves less of a footprint
                          than having big tech companies move to Austin. “CityCoins is like getting the tax revenue of a
                          large company without the footprint and real estate going up.

                          The 2022 Kentucky Derby (officially, the 148th Running of the Kentucky Derby Presented by Woodford
                          Reserve[1]) took place on Saturday, May 7, 2022, at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky. It was
                          the 148th running of the Kentucky Derby, a 1+1⁄4 miles (2.0 km) Grade I stakes race for
                          three-year-old Thoroughbreds. The Derby is held annually at Churchill Downs on the first Saturday
                          in May since its inception in 1875. The 20 horses that ran in the Derby qualified by earning points
                          in the 2022 Road to the Kentucky Derby. The two favorites for the 2022 Kentucky Derby were
                          Epicenter, the winner of the Louisiana Derby, and Zandon, the winner of the Blue Grass Stakes. Both
                          horses finished behind winner Rich Strike, who had only entered the race after a late scratch.
                          Entering the race at odds of 80–1, Rich Strike's victory was the second-largest upset in Derby
                          history. It was the first Kentucky Derby victory for his trainer Eric Reed, as well as the first
                          graded stakes win in any race for his jockey Sonny Leon. Participation in the Kentucky Derby is
                          restricted to three-year-old Thoroughbreds.

                          Summer Is Tomorrow was the leader after a quarter-mile, or two furlongs. He covered that distance
                          in 21.78 seconds — the fastest time in Kentucky Derby history. No horse can sustain that pace for 1
                          1/4 miles. And Summer Is Tomorrow wound up finishing last in the 20-horse field, 64 1/2 lengths

                          because so many trainers and jockeys had decided their best move was to get close to the lead for
                          the opening portions of the race. The biggest indicator that this was going to be a wild finish
                          probably came when track announcer Larry Collmus briefly stopped his rundown of which horse was
                          where in the field at the half-mile mark. “The opening half-mile was — WHOA! — blazing fast, 45.36
                          seconds,” Collmus said. Those fuel tanks were emptying far faster than anticipated. At that
                          half-mile mark, Rich Strike was ahead of only two horses. He was sitting in 18th place. Two
                          answers: He ran by some, and some, as they say in racing, stopped running. Technically, that last
                          part isn’t true. All 20 horses were “running” when they crossed the finish line. Nobody “stopped.”
                          But some simply ran out of gas, meaning their all-out sprints had become little more than a gallop
                          or a jog.

                          respectively 10 April 2022 for the first round and 24 April 2022 for the eventual second round.[9]
                          To be listed on the first-round ballot, candidates needed to secure 500 signatures (often referred
                          to as parrainages in French) from national or local elected officials from at least 30 different
                          departments or overseas collectivities, with no more than a tenth of these signatories from any
                          single department. The signatures were submitted to the Constitutional Council, which is the sole

                          financing of the 2022 presidential campaign was not assured despite "economic restructuring" but
                          still planned to spend €12,000,000, the maximum legally permitted before the first round. According
                          to the report, the party's leadership had seriously considered the possibility of not presenting a

  - Source              :
                          While the sensor size of the front-facing camera isn’t massive (nor do we believe it has to be),
                          upgrades in its lens and sensor allowed for some significant improvements in dynamic range,
                          sharpness and quality. The actual jump between a previous-generation iPhone’s front camera and this
                          new shooter are significant enough for most people to notice immediately. In our testing, the
                          iPhone 14 Pro achieved far sharper shots with vastly — and we mean vastly — superior dynamic range
                          and detail. The previous cameras were simply not capable of delivering very high-quality images or
                          video in challenging mixed light or backlit subjects. We’re seeing some significant advancements
                          made through better software processing (something Apple calls the Photonic Engine) and hardware.
                          While the sensor is larger and there is now variable focus (yes, you can use manual focus on the
                          selfie camera with an app like Halide now!) you shouldn’t expect beautiful bokeh; the autofocus
                          simply allows for much greater sharpness across the frame, with a slight background blur when your
                          subject (no doubt a face) is close enough. Most of the time it’s subtle, and very nice. Notable is
                          that the front facing camera is able to focus quite close — which can result in some pleasing
                          shallow depth of field between your close-up subject and the background: Low light shots are far
                          more usable, with less smudging apparent.

                          default resolution for iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max (this is optional – tap to switch back to 12MP for

                          you’ll be auto-switched to 12MP images but it will still be in the RAW format. Now when you take a

                          my fingertip, the phone powered up and everything was back to normal. I was ready for the real
                          thing, I thought. Days later, a UPS truck pulled up to my driveway. When the delivery man wheeled
                          two bulky containers to my door, he asked what was inside. “It’s equipment for people to repair
                          their own iPhones,” I said. He looked incredulous. While iFixit’s repair kit is lightweight,
                          Apple’s self-repair program rents out the same machines that the company’s technicians use at Apple
                          stores. That’s heavy-duty gear, and when I unpacked the equipment, I had a bad feeling. The three
                          machines — all angular and industrial — looked like serious business. I had never used anything
                          like them before. So I called Mr. Taiyab, who had fixed my family’s devices in the past, and told
                          him my conundrum. He invited me to try the machines on a spare broken phone in his office. So I
                          drove to Mr. Taiyab’s office in South San Francisco with the bulky Apple machines. There, he
                          provided a broken iPhone 12 for practice. Then we walked through the steps together.

                          Images for Netflix) LOS ANGELES - Netflix is bringing "Squid Game" to life with a reality
                          television series that offers "the largest cast and lump sum cash prize in history," according to
                          the streaming giant. The new reality TV series, called "Squid Game: The Challenge," will feature
                          456 contestants competing in a series of games inspired by the hit show. The winner will take the
                          record reward of $4.56 million. "The stakes are high, but in this game the worst fate is going home
                          empty-handed," Netflix said in a statement shared Tuesday. Casting for the show is now open at
                          SquidGameCasting.com in search of any English-language speakers from around the world. The
                          10-episode competition series is a co-production between Studio Lambert ("The Circle") and The
                          Garden ("24 Hours in A&E"), part of ITV Studios, the company said. It will be filmed in the U.K.
                          The original "Squid Game" scripted series, which premiered in September 2021, holds the record as
                          Netflix’s most popular series of all time. The Korean survival drama received more than 1.65
                          billion viewing hours in the first 28 days after its release.

                          If it was a solo campaign you were looking for, then, you'll have to wait until next year for it.
                          Like the original, Overwatch 2 will release on PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and Microsoft Windows
                          PC. But there is a new generation of consoles for this latest game and it will also be out on both
                          the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. Seeing as there has already been an Overwatch 2 beta (and now the game
                          is out), there's no shortage of gameplay footage doing the rounds. Take a look at the video above
                          to see what's in store. Teasing what you should expect from the Overwatch 2 gameplay at launch,
                          Blizzard has said: "Season One will feature Sojourn, Junker Queen, and an unannounced support hero,
                          as well as the new 5v5 PvP experience, reworked heroes, new maps and modes, and more. "We’re also
                          releasing a reimagined competitive experience that was created to give players more tools to
                          improve gameplay and feel a sense of progression in competitive play." Hinting at what this means,
                          it added: "Players will have more of an impact on individual matches with the shift to 5v5, and
                          there will be additional systems in place to help you discern your contributions per match." Sign

                          If it was a solo campaign you were looking for, then, you'll have to wait until next year for it.
                          Like the original, Overwatch 2 will release on PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and Microsoft Windows
                          PC. But there is a new generation of consoles for this latest game and it will also be out on both
                          the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. Seeing as there has already been an Overwatch 2 beta (and now the game
                          is out), there's no shortage of gameplay footage doing the rounds. Take a look at the video above
                          to see what's in store. Teasing what you should expect from the Overwatch 2 gameplay at launch,
                          Blizzard has said: "Season One will feature Sojourn, Junker Queen, and an unannounced support hero,
                          as well as the new 5v5 PvP experience, reworked heroes, new maps and modes, and more. "We’re also
                          releasing a reimagined competitive experience that was created to give players more tools to
                          improve gameplay and feel a sense of progression in competitive play." Hinting at what this means,
                          it added: "Players will have more of an impact on individual matches with the shift to 5v5, and
                          there will be additional systems in place to help you discern your contributions per match." Sign

Question 87              : What was the revenue of AWS in Q2 2022?
Correct Answers         :  
                          19.7 billion
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prediction (only positive):
  - Answer              : tumbled amidst analyst
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          Year-over-year quarterly net sales grew 33% from $14.8 billion in Q2 2021 to $19.7 billion in 2022.
                          Operating income from AWS increased 36% year-over-year from $4.2 billion in Q2 2021 to $5.7 billion
                          this year. During the 2022 second quarter, AWS announced new customer agreements with Delta
                          Airlines and British Telecom, among other enterprises. In the earnings call, Amazon staff stated
                          that over half of capital investment for the entire 2022 year would focus on technology
                          infrastructure for AWS. In the call, Amazon staff projected Q3 2022 net sales to range from $125
                          billion to $130 billion, an increase of 13% to 17% over Q3 2021. Operating income will range from
                          $0 to $3.5 billion, compared with $4.9 billion in Q3 2021. The guidance includes an unfavorable
                          impact on foreign exchange rates. I reported last week on Shopify’s poor second-quarter
                          performance, and I’ve been following Wall Street analysts’ responses to the two companies. While
                          both suffered losses, analysts had a much more bullish response to Amazon. The market agreed, with
                          Amazon’s stock price rising 12% in after-hours trading the day the company announced its results.
                          Shopify’s stock price tumbled amidst analyst criticism, although it has since recovered. Amazon has
                          strengths that Shopify lacks.

                          Peele added his long-awaited third film, Nope, to his collection on July 22. It is a sci-fi horror
                          film that takes both of those genres to completely new and unprecedented places. Peele said about
                          the film, “It’s a bigger adventure than I’ve ever tried to tell. From a film perspective, by far my
                          most ambitious.” Teaming up with renowned cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema, the two created the

                          discourse, creating a slew of new conversations to be had about film and our relationship with it.
                          While Nope hit theaters on July 22, it is currently streaming at home, exclusively on Peacock,
                          having made its way to the NBC-owned streamer on November 18th. If you are more old-skool about
                          your media, you can buy Nope on 4K Ultra HD, Blu-ray, and DVD, with extras including a making of
                          documentary, gag reels, deleted scenes, a deep dive into "The Horse in Motion" short film, and more.

  - Source              :
                          15] Kim Bo-ram in her review for Yonhap News praised director for creatively weaving "breath-taking
                          action sequences of physical combat, gun fights and large-scale helicopter stunts" but stated that
                          "latter part of the movie, when the true story of Carter's mission is revealed, makes the majority
                          of the parts, including the fast-paced action scenes, almost tiring."[16] YTN's Kang Nae-ri stated
                          that the film fails to attracts audience's immersion and the tension decreases towards the second
                          half, but praised Joo Won for his splendid action performance and digesting title role.[17] Writing
                          for Sports Kyunghyang, Lee Da-won criticised the director for using Joo Won's efforts in a crude
                          way. Lee stated that the only good thing about this movie is Joo Won's action sequences but his
                          power lasts less than 20 minutes due to the tattered story and senseless directing.[18] In his
                          review for South China Morning Post, James Marsh wrote [film's] "action feels weightless and
                          simulated, even when propped up by Won’s insanely physical performance", described the film
                          "dizzyingly ridiculous" and rated it with 2 out of 5 stars.

                          At the time, Amazon senior vice president of devices and services David Limp said the company
                          launched the robot with no defined use case. In an interview with WIRED in June, Amazon vice
                          president of consumer robotics Ken Washington said the initial focus is home monitoring and
                          security. Astro is currently only available by invitation only. Washington declined to share the
                          number of Astro in people’s homes today or when Astro will be made generally available. Since
                          launch, Amazon pushed an update to Astro that allows people to add rooms to a home map without the
                          need to remap an entire home. Amazon home robots are currently unable to coordinate activity
                          between multiple units, but Washington said climbing stairs and coordination between Astros on
                          multiple floors are part of the product development roadmap. Rather than hope that Astro catches on
                          with a mass audience, the iRobot acquisition would give Amazon an instant home mapping presence at
                          a huge scale. It’s too early to tell, but the deal could face scrutiny from the Federal Trade

                          MLB at Field of Dreams is a recurring Major League Baseball (MLB) regular-season game played in a
                          ballpark adjacent to Field of Dreams in Dyersville, Iowa, a site popularized by the 1989 baseball
                          film Field of Dreams. The first edition of the game was played on August 12, 2021, with the Chicago
                          White Sox defeating the New York Yankees, 9–8. The second edition of the game was played August 11,
                          2022, with the Chicago Cubs defeating the Cincinnati Reds, 4–2. Both games were held on the second
                          Thursday of August. Future games are on hold while a new youth baseball and softball complex is
                          under construction at the Field of Dreams site. The first edition of the game was planned for
                          August 13, 2020, with the Chicago White Sox facing the New York Yankees.[1] However, due to the
                          COVID-19 pandemic, MLB implemented a shortened 2020 season that limited games played to each team's
                          division and the opposite league's geographically equal division to reduce travel. Hence, on July
                          1, MLB announced that the St. Louis Cardinals would replace the Yankees for the game.[2] After
                          several St. Louis players and coaches tested positive for COVID-19 in late July, MLB postponed
                          several Cardinals games, eventually leading the league to announce on August 3 that the MLB at
                          Field of Dreams game would be postponed to the 2021 season.

                          FSD Beta can best be summarized as a host of new features that are not yet fully debugged. The main
                          attraction is "autosteer on city streets," which lets a Tesla navigate around complex urban
                          environments automatically, if imperfectly. Tesla has never disclosed how many people buy or
                          subscribe to the premium FSD option. In the company's last earnings call, CEO Elon Musk said: "As
                          of now, we've deployed Full Self-Driving Beta to -- for city streets -- to roughly 400,000
                          customers in North America. This is a huge milestone for autonomy as FSD Beta is the only way any
                          consumer can actually test the latest AI-powered autonomy." NHTSA and Tesla communications say the
                          system is something much simpler: a "SAE level 2 driver support feature that can provide steering
                          and braking/acceleration support to the driver under certain operating limitations." The safety
                          recall report notes, "the driver is responsible for operation of the vehicle whenever the feature
                          is engaged and must constantly supervise the feature and intervene (e.g., steer, brake or
                          accelerate) as needed to maintain safe operation of the vehicle." Shares of Tesla fell a little
                          more than 1% on the news, then quickly recovered. This is a developing story. Please check back for

                          its tininess, with enormous repercussions for the kingdom. The scene was a somber counterpoint to

  - Answer              : wearer’s surroundings and help the virtual environment change realistically
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          Sony says the PS VR2 has a 4K resolution, which translates to 2,000 x 2,040px per eye, and there’s
                          HDR (high dynamic range) technology too, for improved contrast and brighter colours. The headset
                          uses an OLED display, so we’re hoping for the sort of vivid colours and deep blacks that the
                          technology is known for. Additionally, the frame rates of 90Hz and 120Hz should make for smoother
                          visuals. The field-of-view, a key metric when it comes to VR, is 110 degrees. The PS VR2 has
                          outwards-facing cameras on its exterior for inside-out tracking. VR headsets use this technology to
                          map the wearer’s surroundings and help the virtual environment change realistically as they move
                          their head, without the need for extra sensors placed around the room, as used to be the case with
                          some VR systems. Added to this, the PS VR2 also includes eye-tracking tech, which will detect the
                          motion of the gamer’s eyes, helping them explore and control a game by looking in specific
                          directions. Further sensor tech includes headset feedback, which Sony says “amplifies the
                          sensations of in-game actions from the player. It’s created by a single built-in motor with
                          vibrations that add an intelligent tactile element, bringing players closer to the gameplay
                          experience.” Read more: Best PS5 games for every kind of player, from Elden Ring to Stray Sony is

                          Kolo Muani kept France alive by scoring his chance, setting up a chance for Montiel to make up for
                          his late handball by clinching the championship for Argentina. Montiel scored low to the left,
                          giving Argentina their third World Cup trophy and first since 1986.[75] Man of the Match: Lionel

                          a duel between Paris Saint-Germain teammates Messi and Mbappé.[80][81][82][83] The match has since
                          been hailed as one of the most exciting World Cup finals, and among the greatest football matches
                          of all time.[84][85][86][87] With the victory, Argentina won their third FIFA World Cup title to
                          surpass France and Uruguay, their titles ranking behind only Brazil's five and the four of Italy

                          The Souls games by FromSoftware ranked, including ‘Elden Ring’ Dark Souls (FromSoftware’s most
                          recognizable action role-playing series), “Bloodborne” and “Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice” are all
                          brutally punishing games. Despite this, the studio’s work is widely cited as a major influence on
                          dozens of other titles such as “Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order,” “God of War” and “The Witcher 3:
                          Wild Hunt.” Many gamers and critics have asked FromSoftware to add difficulty settings to its
                          games; the studio has steadfastly refused so far. FromSoftware’s award-winning creative director
                          Hidetaka Miyazaki has said the uniformly intense challenge in his games is meant to provide players
                          with a sense of accomplishment. This polarizing design philosophy has won FromSoftware a devoted
                          following — but also a small cadre of detractors who have described the company’s games as
                          alienating. That perception changed with “Elden Ring.” FromSoftware’s most recent title, made in
                          collaboration with “A Game of Thrones” writer George R.R. Martin, was a roaring success, selling
                          over 16 million copies. Critics and fans praised FromSoftware’s approach in “Elden Ring,” which
                          made the game more accessible than the studio’s previous titles with a wider array of playstyle
                          options. FromSoftware has long been a highly praised and well-respected developer. But after “Elden
                          Ring,” it’s now seen as a hitmaker.

                          The Souls games by FromSoftware ranked, including ‘Elden Ring’ Dark Souls (FromSoftware’s most
                          recognizable action role-playing series), “Bloodborne” and “Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice” are all
                          brutally punishing games. Despite this, the studio’s work is widely cited as a major influence on
                          dozens of other titles such as “Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order,” “God of War” and “The Witcher 3:
                          Wild Hunt.” Many gamers and critics have asked FromSoftware to add difficulty settings to its
                          games; the studio has steadfastly refused so far. FromSoftware’s award-winning creative director
                          Hidetaka Miyazaki has said the uniformly intense challenge in his games is meant to provide players
                          with a sense of accomplishment. This polarizing design philosophy has won FromSoftware a devoted
                          following — but also a small cadre of detractors who have described the company’s games as
                          alienating. That perception changed with “Elden Ring.” FromSoftware’s most recent title, made in
                          collaboration with “A Game of Thrones” writer George R.R. Martin, was a roaring success, selling
                          over 16 million copies. Critics and fans praised FromSoftware’s approach in “Elden Ring,” which
                          made the game more accessible than the studio’s previous titles with a wider array of playstyle
                          options. FromSoftware has long been a highly praised and well-respected developer. But after “Elden
                          Ring,” it’s now seen as a hitmaker.

                          I learned so much from Bud those three years. Three years is a pretty good run, especially when
                          you’re a sponge and you’re a young coach and you’re just soaking up everything.” ACC commissioner
                          says league is trying to close gap with Big Ten and SEC Pry parlayed the knowledge he gained from
                          Foster into a successful career as an assistant, most recently serving as Penn State’s defensive
                          coordinator since 2014 before undertaking the assignment of overhauling the program at Virginia
                          Tech on the heels of Justin Fuente’s departure. Unlike his predecessor, Pry has made himself
                          accessible in the community, following the model established under Frank Beamer, the program
                          architect who turned Virginia Tech into a national power.

                          It’s short on top-tier talent and facing depth deficiencies in key areas, the fallout from subpar
                          recruiting classes, a revolving door in the transfer portal and at times disappointing development
                          by his predecessor. Virginia Tech returns one All-ACC player from last year: sophomore punter Peter
                          Moore, who was a third-teamer. After losing a large group of veterans, there’s no surefire 2023 NFL
                          Draft pick on the roster. Tech has been shut out in the draft only once in the past 29 years
                          (2019). Pry has spent most of his time trying to untangle the roster he inherited, with 10 players
                          switching positions this spring and nine more heading to the transfer portal, though that attrition
                          was necessary to get the Hokies under the scholarship limit and open up some spots this summer for
                          transfer additions who could make an immediate impact. Put simply, sorting this all out is going to
                          take time. Advertisement Pry has been inside the machine, having previously served under James
                          Franklin for eight years as linebackers coach and defensive coordinator. He’s seen the blueprint
                          for a successful big-time program and, from the looks of it, is trying to recreate it in some
                          (smaller) form six hours to the south in Blacksburg. While Pry won’t quite have the resources or
                          the national cachet that the Nittany Lions do, he’s still assembled the largest staff Virginia Tech
                          has ever had and taken a page out of the Franklin playbook by prioritizing relationships.

                          Jackie Evancho has released a new album called Carousel of Time. The project contains 10 gorgeous
                          covers of songs originally by legendary singer/songwriter Joni Mitchell. This album shows just how
                          much Evancho has matured as an artist since she appeared on America’s Got Talent. It’s appropriate
                          that Evancho chose Carousel of Time as the title of this album. The phrase comes from a lyric in
                          Mitchell’s song “The Circle Game,” which is all about growing up and looking back at where we came
                          from. In 2010, Evancho finished AGT in second place at the age of 10. Now 22, the singer is finding
                          her voice as an adult in the music industry. That voice, as we’ve come to expect, is absolutely
                          beautiful. Evancho brings a signature ethereal quality to Mitchell’s music, as well as a clear
                          emotional connection with the lyrics. In addition to the nostalgic “Circle Game,” other highlights
                          from the album include the bittersweet opening track, “Both Sides Now,” as well as the soaring “A
                          Case of You” and the melancholy “River.” The project is likely to serve as a captivating
                          introduction to Mitchell’s music for a younger generation.

                          animated sitcom to win a 12th time. The saving grace for “Entergalactic” is that this is a category
                          that encourages innovative animated projects like “Genndy Tartakovsky’s Primal” or “BoJack
                          Horseman” to keep going even if it does not always award them. A win for “Entergalactic” could mean
                          the special becomes a series. A win for “The Simpsons” does little for the Fox hit’s trajectory

                          from 1975-85, when the field doubled from 32 to 64 teams. Much like the CFP now, that expansion
                          wasn’t so much about making sure a potential champion wasn’t left out. It was about increasing

                          consensus needed to push it forward. Expansion for the 2024 season was pronounced dead back in

                          Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Ireland’s data privacy regulator has agreed to levy a
                          record fine of 405 million euros ($402 million) against social network Instagram following an
                          investigation into its handling of children’s data, a spokesperson for the watchdog said. Instagram
                          plans to appeal against the fine, a spokesperson for its parent company, Meta, said in an emailed
                          statement. The investigation, which started in 2020, focused on child users between the ages of 13
                          and 17 who were allowed to operate business accounts, which facilitated the publication of the
                          user’s phone number and/or email address. “We adopted our final decision last Friday and it does
                          contain a fine of 405 million euro,” said the spokesperson for Ireland’s Data Protection
                          Commissioner, the lead regulator of Instagram and Facebook’s (FB) parent company. Instagram is
                          rolling out new parental supervision tools Full details of the decision will be published next
                          week, he said. Instagram updated its settings over a year ago and has since released new features
                          to keep teens safe and their information private, the Meta spokesperson said. The spokesperson said
                          Instagram disagrees with how the fine was calculated and is carefully reviewing the decision. The
                          DPC regulates Facebook, Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOGL) and other technology giants due to the
                          location of their EU headquarters in Ireland.

                          While today’s announcement is not final, it serves as a clear indication that the U.K.’s
                          investigations have unearthed enough to warrant a potentially hefty fine. The ICO has issued a
                          “notice of intent” to TikTok Inc. and TikTok Information Technologies UK Limited, which is
                          basically a legal document that outlines its findings ahead of the final decision, giving TikTok a
                          chance to respond. “This Notice of Intent, covering the period May 2018 to July 2020, is
                          provisional and as the ICO itself has stated, no final conclusions can be drawn at this time,” a
                          TikTok spokesperson said in a statement issued to TechCrunch. “While we respect the ICO’s role in
                          safeguarding privacy in the U.K., we disagree with the preliminary views expressed and intend to
                          formally respond to the ICO in due course.” The ICO was also quick to stress that “no conclusion
                          should be drawn at this stage” in terms of whether there has been a breach of data protection law,
                          or that any fine will in fact be imposed. “We all want children to be able to learn and experience
                          the digital world, but with proper data privacy protections,” Information Commissioner John Edwards
                          said in a statement. “Companies providing digital services have a legal duty to put those
                          protections in place, but our provisional view is that TikTok fell short of meeting that
                          requirement.” Under current laws, the U.K. has the power to fine companies that contravene U.K.

                          With Batman and Commissioner Gordon dead, the Gotham Knights must rise up... The Gotham Knights
                          release date is finally arriving this week, and everyone can soon play through the latest foray
                          into Gotham City. Without Batman or Commissioner Gordon to protect the city following their deaths,
                          the task is instead left up to the Bat-Family of Nightwing, Batgirl, Robin, and the Red Hood. In
                          your way stands the mysterious secret society the Court of Owls. It's a decent game, too. In our
                          three-star Gotham Knights review, we called it "a mixed bag" but noted that, "once you stop
                          comparing it to Arkham in your head", you should find plenty to enjoy. Enough of our babbling,
                          here's everything you need to know about Gotham Knights from its release date and trailers to how
                          to pre-order it for yourself. Plus, is it on Game Pass? The Gotham Knights release date will take
                          place on 21st October 2022, the developers have confirmed. You can buy your copy from the likes of
                          Amazon. The game has already seen a number of different release dates come and go, but it looks
                          like the delays are over and this one will stick! For console players, the Gotham Knights launch
                          time in the UK is midnight BST, just as the clock ticks over to 21st October. PC players,
                          meanwhile, have to wait until 5pm on 21st October to play the co-op game on either Steam or the
                          Epic Games Store.

  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          Elizabeth, who believed that she was speaking to Chrétien, said she supported Canadian unity and
                          would try to influence Quebec's referendum on proposals to break away from Canada.[159] In the year
                          that followed, public revelations on the state of Charles and Diana's marriage continued.[160] In
                          consultation with her husband and John Major, as well as the Archbishop of Canterbury (George
                          Carey) and her private secretary (Robert Fellowes), Elizabeth wrote to Charles and Diana at the end
                          of December 1995, suggesting that a divorce would be advisable.[161] In August 1997, a year after
                          the divorce, Diana was killed in a car crash in Paris. Elizabeth was on holiday with her extended
                          family at Balmoral. Diana's two sons, Princes William and Harry, wanted to attend church, so
                          Elizabeth and Philip took them that morning.[162] Afterwards, for five days, the royal couple
                          shielded their grandsons from the intense press interest by keeping them at Balmoral where they
                          could grieve in private,[163] but the royal family's silence and seclusion, and the failure to fly
                          a flag at half-mast over Buckingham Palace, caused public dismay.[131][164] Pressured by the
                          hostile reaction, Elizabeth agreed to return to London and address the nation in a live television
                          broadcast on 5 September, the day before Diana's funeral.

  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          Alcaraz won 12 of the first 13 points, building a 3-0 lead and breaking Tiafoe’s serve three times
                          as he rolled to take the set 6-1 and gain a two-sets-to-one advantage. By the end, Tiafoe looked
                          lost, double-faulting, committing error after error, unable to get his feet behind the ball and set
                          up to swing. Alcaraz beat him every which way, pushing him deep into the backcourt, then drawing
                          him up to the net and passing him, as he seized control of a match that seemed like it would be
                          over before too long. Matthew Futterman Carlos Alcaraz drew even with Frances Tiafoe, winning the
                          second set, 6-3, with a display of hustle and shotmaking that has made him the best teenager in
                          men’s tennis since his fellow Spaniard Rafael Nadal came along nearly 20 years ago. After taking
                          the first set in a tiebreaker, Tiafoe stayed even with Alcaraz through the first five games, but
                          trouble arrived when he was serving at 2-3. That’s when Alcaraz showed that if he can stay healthy,
                          he could have a career as good as anyone who has ever played the game. Balls that don’t come back
                          against other players come back when Alcaraz is on the other side of the net.

                          Then in the last set he was up once more, and then all even again. The crowd rode every wave, with
                          the match sounding like a New York Rangers hockey game as fans bellowed “Let’s go, Tiafoe!” — and
                          then shifting to something like a soccer match in Madrid, as choruses of “Olé, Olé, Olé, Olé” rang
                          through the stands, only to turn back into a Rangers game again. When it was finally finished, just
                          before midnight, 4 hours 18 minutes after it began, Alcaraz had become the first teenage man to
                          reach a Grand Slam final since Rafael Nadal won his first French Open in 2005. That was the first
                          of 22 Nadal has captured in his career. If Alcaraz beats Casper Ruud of Norway on Sunday, he will
                          rise to No. 1 in the world rankings, and who knows how many more Grand Slams he will win. He
                          finished off Tiafoe with a magical lob to get to triple match point, and he needed all three, with
                          Tiafoe finally netting one last backhand.

                          Racing following months of failed sponsorship talks, but here we are. The two-time Nascar Cup
                          Series champion is officially a driver for Richard Childress Racing, as he will take over the No. 8
                          Chevrolet in 2023. The move is a serious blow to Toyota, which invested in Busch when he joined the
                          OEM in 2008 as a hot-headed young gun. No matter what trouble Busch got himself into, Toyota and
                          Mars Wrigley — his primary sponsor until 2022 — always had his back. Two championships and dozens
                          of wins later, Busch was waiting for JGR to sign a new primary sponsor and then have a contract
                          extension of his own. But when an unreported company backed out late in the going, it left JGR with
                          little time to find a new multi-million dollar primary sponsor for Busch’s No. 18 car. In return,
                          team owner Joe Gibbs’ grandson Ty Gibbs will take over the car, which moves the No. 54, in 2023.
                          Now, Busch will focus on his return to Chevrolet, the manufacturer that believed in him from the
                          start.

                          got hip to the kryptonite pretty early and he’s used that as a source. Over the years, he’s created
                          clones and massive robots and destructive weapons and things to deal with Superman. I think, in

                          demonstration of a need to connect with Superboy and to perhaps pass on to him. He basically says
                          Lexcorp goes to you. I got nobody else. Superboy’s response is I don’t think of you as my father.
                          Initially, there’s a manipulation because he is Superboy but he’s also a young man.

                          know the comic books, you know his life work has been trying to — because he doesn’t have
                          superpowers — create things based on his massive mind, and how to combat and defeat Superman. He
                          got hip to the kryptonite pretty early and he’s used that as a source. Over the years, he’s created

                          hit series Squid Game. The win makes him the first Asian actor to receive the award. The win also
                          makes him only the fourth Asian actor ever to win an Emmy for acting and the first ever to win the
                          award for a non-English speaking role. Lee competed against Jason Bateman (Ozark), Brian Cox
                          (Succession), Bob Odenkirk (Better Call Saul), Adam Scott (Severance) and Jeremy Strong
                          (Succession). "Thank you to the Television Academy, thank you to Netflix and thank you to the

                          Some of the youngest members of the family were in attendance at the abbey - the Queen's
                          great-grandchildren Prince George and Princess Charlotte, aged nine and seven, sat with their
                          parents the Prince and Princess of Wales. Prime Minister Liz Truss and her husband Hugh O'Leary
                          were present alongside cabinet ministers and all of the UK's surviving former prime ministers,
                          seated in the abbey's quire. About 100 presidents and heads of government joined the 2,000-strong
                          congregation at the abbey - as well as US President Joe Biden and his wife, Jill, there were French
                          President Emmanuel Macron, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, Canadian PM Justin Trudeau,
                          South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol and Chinese Vice-President Wang Qishan. Europe's royal
                          families were strongly represented - with kings and queens from Denmark, Spain, Sweden, Norway,
                          Belgium and The Netherlands. Denmark's Queen Margrethe II - now Europe's longest-reigning monarch -
                          sat opposite King Charles close to the coffin. The Emperor and Empress of Japan also attended,
                          alongside other overseas royalty including Malaysia's King and Queen and King Abdullah II and Queen
                          Rania of Jordan. The religious service heard church leaders highlight the affection in which the
                          Queen has been held by many people. The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby said: "People of

Question 161              : Where did Queen Elizabeth II's state funeral take place?
Correct Answers         :

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                          "So I said to [Queen Elizabeth II], 'How did you manage?' And I remember she just said, 'Well, you
                          just get on with it.' And that was actually probably the best and most factual advice I could
                          have," Ardern said. The pallbearers raised Queen Elizabeth II's coffin from the catafalque in the
                          center of Westminster Abbey and began processing with it through the center aisle of the great
                          nave, to bring it outside and place it back on the State Gun Carriage. The coffin will be followed
                          in procession on the carriage by King Charles III and Camilla, the Queen Consort, along with other
                          members of the family. The entire procession was to take about 45 minutes to reach Wellington Arch,
                          at Hyde Park Corner. From there, the queen's coffin was to be placed in a hearse for the drive west
                          from central London to Windsor, where the queen will be laid to rest in her family chapel next to
                          her late husband Prince Philip. Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby gave the commendation over
                          the queen's coffin as the funeral service neared its end on Monday. The commendation, essentially a
                          prayer for the late queen to be welcomed into heaven, included the traditional line: "Go forth, O
                          Christian soul, from this world," which is often included in funeral services.

                          One plane crashed near the 10,000 block of Niwot Road on the south side of the road, the sheriff’s
                          office said. Two people onboard were dead. The other downed plane was found in the 9,700 block of
                          Niwot Road on the north side. The pilot of the plane was dead. The two planes involved were
                          described by National Transportation Safety Board investigators as a Cessna 172 and a Sonex Xenos
                          aircraft. The Sonex Xenos is a light, aluminum, low-wing homebuilt aircraft that seats two. The
                          Cessna 172 Skyhawk is a popular single-engine aircraft that seats four. None of the people involved
                          was identified immediately. Tom Falk and his wife, Susan, operate a 100-acre farm off of the 9500
                          block of Niwot Road. One plane crashed in an irrigation ditch about 300 yards from their home. The
                          couple did not see or witness the crash, but they did hear and see the nearby emergency response.
                          “We just heard a lot of rescue coming,” he said. Falk said that after the crash he walked their
                          property, which is about five miles south, and a bit east, of the Vance Brand Airport, a
                          Longmont-owned public-use airport. “There’s always a lot of light aircraft coming around, but
                          nothing unusual,” Falk said. Falk said he couldn’t recall any prior plane crashes in the area.
                          “It’s unusual,” he said.

Question 165              : Who is Italy's first female prime minister?
Correct Answers         :  
                          Giorgia Meloni
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prediction (only positive):
  - Answer              : who you read."[116
  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          Observers have debated how right-wing a Meloni-led government would be, and which label and
                          position on the political spectrum would be more accurate or realistic. Many variously described it
                          as Italy's first far-right-led government since World War II,[104][110] and Meloni as the first
                          far-right leader since Benito Mussolini, and some academics also described it as the most
                          right-wing government since 1945.[111][112] Many questioned its direction, citing Berlusconi's and
                          Salvini's Russian ties,[113] in contrast to Meloni's Atlanticism.[100] Others, such as Sky News,
                          while citing Meloni's and her party's neo-fascist roots, disagreed with the far-right label and
                          said: "Giorgia Meloni is not a fascist."[114][115] Steve Sedwick of CNBC summarised the discussion,
                          saying: "Have we got a centre-right coalition, have we got a right coalition, have we got a
                          far-right coalition, or have we got a fascist coalition? I have seen all four printed, depending on
                          who you read."[116] Immediately after the first meeting of the new legislature, tensions began to
                          grow within the centre-right coalition. On 13 October, Berlusconi refused to support Ignazio La
                          Russa, FdI's candidacy to be President of the Senate of the Republic.

  - Source              :
                          Her allies, on the other hand, say Meloni has the kind of serious plans her predecessors have
                          lacked, and that she chiefly wants to address Italy’s economic woes. Her stump speech is
                          theatrical, but it deals mostly with ideas about boosting investment and curbing welfare. Her
                          party’s recently released platform has 25 proposals — everything from extending high-speed rail
                          lines to jump-starting university research. Voters inclined toward Meloni tended to cite, in
                          interviews with The Post, her perceived honesty and coherence as the reasons for their support. For
                          now, Meloni’s Fratelli d’Italia party — the Brothers of Italy, a name that echoes lyrics in the
                          national anthem — is the most popular in the country, favored by roughly one-quarter of voters. It
                          has a coalition agreement with other parties on the right, giving it overwhelming odds to prevail
                          against a fractured and reeling left. The right-wing bloc has said that the premier job should go
                          to the leader of the party with the most votes. Still, following the Sept. 25 general election, the
                          president, Sergio Mattarella, has final say on who gets the mandate. Meloni acknowledged in her
                          Post interview that Italy is facing extraordinary challenges. She mentioned the rising cost of
                          energy and raw materials, uncertainty about whether the pandemic might come roaring back, and
                          Italy’s towering public debt — which perpetually leaves the country several missteps away from
                          crisis. There’s a reason Italy has had 11 governments in the past 20 years.

                          Last updated on 19 September 202219 September 2022.From the section Wales Wales have called up
                          teenage Birmingham City midfielder Jordan James for their Nations League games against Belgium and
                          Poland on 22 and 25 September after injury ruled out Joe Allen. Uncapped James, 18, has played for
                          England Under-20s and was last week included in the Wales Under-21 squad. Senior Wales boss Robert
                          Page has now promoted James to his squad. While a hamstring strain ruled out Allen, defender Ben
                          Davies' small leg fracture forced his absence. Swansea's Allen and Tottenham's Davies picked up the
                          injuries with their clubs. Davies, 29, is expected to be out for around three weeks after suffering
                          his injury in Spurs' Champions League defeat by Sporting Lisbon. Allen came off in Swansea's 3-0
                          Championship win over Hull on Saturday. Wales travel to Belgium on Thursday before hosting Poland
                          three days later. Spurs manager Antonio Conte has said Davies will not be available for Wales duty.
                          "He had an injury in his knee in the game against Sporting Lisbon, and he played with this injury,"
                          Conte told Sky Sports. "It is not a serious injury, I think (he will be back) after the
                          international break because, with the national team, he is not available. "But I think after the
                          international break, he will be available for us." Allen, 32, missed the start of the season with a
                          hamstring problem picked up on Wales duty in June.

                          the telecast did not happen last year and that NBC might not air it next year, so they may as well
                          get real and get some stuff off their chests. In his opening monologue, Carmichael sat on the edge

                          Separating the device's true performance from the excitement of a brand-new flagship smartwatch for
                          this Pixel Watch review wasn't a simple task. The best of Google and Fitbit united? It almost
                          sounded too good to be true; and, for the most part, it lives up to its promises. Google apps run
                          smoothly and Fitbit's health-tracking is as holistic as ever. But as time went on with the Pixel
                          Watch, some inconveniences presented themselves that are uncharacteristic for a $349 smartwatch,
                          though unsurprising for a version 1.0 device. The battery life feels very un-Fitbit, and the big
                          bezel is a missed opportunity. There was also a worrying moment when I thought I would never get
                          the watch strap back on my review unit, though I did eventually get a grasp on the interchangeable
                          band mechanism. Despite these reservations, the Pixel Watch offers wearable experience different
                          enough from the Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 and similar enough to the Apple Watch Series 8. By that I
                          mean Wear OS on the Pixel Watch surprisingly stands apart from the software on Samsung's
                          smartwatches, in way that emulates the intuition and interconnectivity of the Apple Watch. And
                          that's why I'd consider it one of the best smartwatches of the year. The Pixel Watch costs $349
                          (£339 / AU$549) for a GPS + Bluetooth-only configuration, while the LTE-compatible version costs
                          $399 (£379 / AU$649).

                          of silence before a video was shown praising Abe’s life in politics. It included his 2006
                          parliamentary speech vowing to build a “beautiful Japan,” his visits to disaster-hit northern Japan
                          after the March 2011 tsunami and his 2016 Super Mario impersonation in Rio de Janeiro to promote
                          the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Kishida, in a 12-minute eulogy, praised Abe as a politician with a clear
                          vision for post-World War II economic growth who promoted national security, the development of
                          Japan and the world and a “free and open Indo-Pacific” as a counter to China’s rise. “You were a
                          person who should have lived much longer,” Kishida said as he looked up at a massive photo of Abe.
                          “I had a firm belief that you would contribute as a compass showing the future direction of Japan
                          and the rest of the world for 10 or 20 more years.” Kishida said Abe will be remembered not just as
                          the nation’s longest-serving leader but for what he achieved, and he pledged to carry on Abe’s
                          policies for Japan and the region. During the ceremony, Harris sat in the third row next to Rahm
                          Emanuel, the U.S. ambassador to Japan, and they later joined others by placing a branch of

                          57][58][59] When Banting published the paper that brought him the Nobel,[60] Paulescu already held
                          a patent for his discovery (10 April 1922, patent no. 6254 (8322) "Pancreina şi procedeul
                          fabricaţiei ei"/"Pancrein and the process of making it", from the Romanian Ministry of Industry and
                          Trade).[61][62][63] The Spanish neurophysiologist Fernando de Castro (1896–1967) was the first to
                          describe arterial chemoreceptors and circumscribe them to the carotid body for the respiratory
                          reflexes in 1926–1928. For many experts, this direct disciple of Santiago Ramón y Cajal deserved to
                          share the Nobel Prize 1938 with the awarded Corneille Heymans, but at that time Spain was immersed
                          in the Spanish Civil War and it seems that the Nobel Board even doubted if he was alive or not,
                          being at the front since almost the beginning of the conflict. Heymans himself recognised the
                          merits of De Castro for the Nobel Prize in different occasions, including a famous talk in
                          Montevideo (Uruguay).[64] In 1949, despite protests from the medical establishment, the Portuguese
                          neurologist António Egas Moniz received the Physiology or Medicine Prize for his development of the
                          prefrontal leucotomy, which he promoted by declaring the procedure's success just 10 days

                          The network is also expected to rely on more programming from unaligned studios such as Warner
                          Bros. TV, Sony Pictures TV, and Lionsgate, as its 20th Century Fox TV sister becomes a part of
                          Disney. Collier’s background is mostly in cable, and in particular smaller, scrappier networks like
                          AMC, SundanceTV, Oxygen and A&E Networks. That experience — including how to program, promote, and
                          sell with a smaller infrastructure — could serve him and Fox well as the network undergoes its own
                          change. Like Newman, Collier also brings more of a business background to the job, which makes a

                          Rob Wade, and chief marketing officer Shannon Ryan. The timing of the transition also comes as Fox
                          celebrates strong early fall ratings: Over the first two weeks in Live+7 ratings, Fox is up 24
                          percent vs. last season — thanks to series such as “9-1-1,” “Empire,” and “Last Man Standing.” “I
                          can’t imagine a more exciting next step than this new role at Fox, which combines the power and
                          reach of a broadcast division, some of the best live assets on the planet from which to build
                          entertainment audiences and fan engagement, and a proven leadership team with a ‘make new rules’
                          start-up mentality,” Collier said in a statement.

                          Adam asks Captain Marvel to bequeath powers on Adrianna, using a version of the Hatshepsut amulet,
                          and Billy agrees. The newly empowered Isis has similar powers to Adam’s, as well as healing and
                          nature powers (flowers bloom when she’s happy, etc.). Black Adam and Isis then rescue Adrianna’s
                          younger brother Amon from slavery and grant him powers as well, turning him into the superhero
                          Osiris. For an all too brief time, the three are happy together, using their powers for the good of

                          small role in the 2011 New 52 reboot, but a new version of her returned to television in 2017, in

                          dystopian near-future, with no connection to the Shazam family; she does have a hereditary magic
                          amulet, but it gives her wind powers and not the other suite of powers her comics counterpart has.

                          Oh, boy! NBC's Quantum Leap revival is officially making the jump from pilot to series, with
                          Raymond Lee starring in the lead role. According to The Hollywood Reporter, NBC has handed out a
                          formal series order to the Quantum Leap revival, with a view to airing the new series as part of
                          its 2022-23 fall schedule. The network released a photo from the sequel, which recently wrapped
                          production, spotlighting the show's new central character Dr. Ben Seong played by Raymond Lee.

                          since Dr. Sam Beckett stepped into the accelerator and vanished." Original Quantum Leap star Scott
                          Bakula is not currently attached to the revival despite the actor previously revealing that he had
                          been involved in conversations about returning. He also said he had spoken to series creator Donald
                          P. Bellisario periodically over the years and encouraged him to move forward with his ideas for the
                          long-dormant series. The revival was formally picked up to pilot in January, with Bellisario
                          onboard as an executive producer.

                          Following months of anticipation and controversy among its add-in board partners, NVIDIA's 40
                          series GPUs are finally here. The company unveiled the GeForce RTX 4090 and GeForce RTX 4080 today
                          at its GTC 2022 keynote. Taking full advantage of its new "Ada Lovelace" architecture, NVIDIA says
                          the two GPUs offer significantly better ray tracing performance. The company worked with Taiwan
                          Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) to co-develop a new "4N" fabrication process that NVIDIA
                          says is up to two times more power efficient than the 8nm process it used for its 30 Series cards.
                          Ray tracing performance is significantly improved thanks to Ada Lovelace featuring NVIDIA's new
                          third-generation RT Cores, and the inclusion of a new rendering technique called Shader Execution
                          Reordering and DLSS 3.0. In some games, NVIDIA said you can expect two to three times better ray
                          tracing performance than what was possible with its Ampere GPUs. The company demoed Cyberpunk 2077
                          running at a near consistent 100 frames per second with all of the game's ray tracing features set
                          to max. NVIDIA said rasterization performance is up to two times faster thanks to the new
                          architecture. The first of NVIDIA's new Ada Lovelace GPUs will arrive next month when the GeForce
                          RTX 4090 goes on for sale for $1,599 on October 12th.

                          Comparing the RTX 4090 to the RTX 4080 reveals a flaw in Nvidia’s pricing plan for this generation
                          — the numbers just don’t add up. If you look at the RTX 4080 alone, regardless of the price, it is
                          a really good graphics card. It outperforms every GPU from the previous generation, including the
                          RTX 3090 Ti, by a considerable amount. The sales of the RTX 4080 are showing us what gamers truly
                          think. It’s also around 30% slower than the RTX 4090 while only being 25% cheaper, and this is
                          where things get complicated, because, at MSRP, the RTX 4090 is a much better deal than the 4080 —
                          even if it’s more expensive. It offers much better performance per dollar, which historically
                          hasn’t been the case. The flagships were aimed at enthusiasts who didn’t try to get the best deal;
                          they just wanted the best performance. Take one step down from the top and the good deals start,
                          where the performance is still great but the price is less ridiculous. That hasn’t been true in
                          this generation, and the sales of the RTX 4080 are showing us what Nvidia’s customers think about
                          this. Every time a new GPU drops, scalpers can be counted on to buy it en masse and then throw it
                          up on eBay at a huge markup.

                          This makes the Pixel Watch a bit more affordable than the Apple Watch Series 8 ($399) but pricier
                          than the Galaxy Watch 5 ($279) and recently-released Fitbit Sense 2 ($299). (See the rest of the
                          differences between the Google Pixel Watch vs. Fitbit Sense 2.) The Pixel Watch release date was
                          October 13, 2022, and since then we're continuing to track the best Pixel Watch deals. Note that
                          the Pixel Watch launched alongside the Google Pixel 7 and Google Pixel 7 Pro, which would both make
                          ideal companion devices for the company's smartwatch. The Google Pixel Watch is a simple-looking
                          smartwatch, I might even call it minimalistic. It comes in just one size: 41mm. Those with larger
                          wrists might complain about the lack of a larger option; that said, it fit me perfectly. The face
                          features a rounded design with a 3D glass dome. This raised effect distracts from the display's
                          thick bezel, but doesn't change the fact that a good chunk of the display is unusable. Perhaps my
                          prior experience with Samsung watches is to blame? I can't help but think it's a missed opportunity
                          to incorporate in digital rotating bezel in that space. It seems like no mistake that the Pixel
                          Watch is a "dark mode" device. The interface and all of Google's watch faces have black backgrounds
                          to further conceal the bezel.

                          Wednesday for her work, efforts and goodwill by honoring her with the 2022 Caregiver Champion
                          Award. Savannah was honored with the prestigious award during the Elizabeth Dole Foundation’s
                          annual Heroes & History Makers Gala. Previously, the award has been granted to former first lady
                          Michelle Obama, actor Gary Sinise, and country music star Tim McGraw. The event, which honors the
                          5.5 million caregivers of wounded warriors across the country, marked the gala's 10th anniversary.
                          In 2012, former Sen. Elizabeth Dole established the foundation which runs Hidden Heroes, a campaign
                          that spotlights military caregivers and provide them with much-needed support. Savannah joined
                          Hidden Heroes in 2018 as an ambassador. Actor Tom Hanks, the first to ever receive the Caregiver
                          Champion Award, hosted the gala and presented the TODAY co-anchor with the award. Before giving
                          Savannah her award, Hanks spoke about her contribution to Hidden Heroes, describing it as
                          “stellar.” “She’s here not only because of her stellar work that has helped Hidden Heroes itself
                          but because she — let’s face it. She’s a little underexposed,” he quipped about Savannah. “She
                          should be out there a little more often because it’s not just the three hours a day that she’s on.

                          Today, Prospect Park is an international model for the care of urban parks, and one of the premier
                          green spaces in the United States. Over the past decade, Prospect Park Alliance has expanded its
                          operating budget to more than $13 million each year for the care of the park, and increased its
                          endowment to $25 million. In addition, the Alliance has secured more than $130 million in public
                          funding for capital improvements, including the restoration of the Vale in the park’s northeast
                          corner, the largest single capital allocation in the history of the Alliance. Other current and
                          recent projects include the award-winning restorations of the Endale Arch and Concert Grove
                          Pavilion, and the restoration of the Flatbush Avenue perimeter and the creation of two new
                          entrances to the park along Flatbush, the first new entrances to the park since the 1940s. During
                          the pandemic, when the park saw record visitorship and a drop in public funding, the Alliance was
                          able to rally its community of volunteers and supporters for record volunteer and fundraising
                          success, which resulted in Re:New Prospect Park, an ongoing initiative to sustain the park to
                          address high use during the pandemic via maintenance and capital improvements. Re:New also includes
                          a partnership with ACE New York, a workforce development nonprofit for those experiencing
                          homelessness, which provides a crew to supplement the City’s trash management efforts on peak days

                          In the most significant deal that the Northern Ireland games industry has seen to date, Derry-based
                          studio Hypixel Studios has been bought by games industry giant Riot Games. The past year has been
                          fantastic for the Northern Ireland games industry, with Northern Ireland Screen's Pixel Mill game
                          development accelerator taking off, Belfast-based studio Italic Pig signing a major publishing
                          deal, and other local wins. Those achievements were dwarfed this week by the announcement that
                          Derry-based studio Hypixel Studios has been officially acquired by industry giant Riot Games. Riot
                          Games is known for its hugely successful global MOBA League of Legends, which took the esports
                          scene by storm and now packs out stadiums each year for its world championship finals. Its upcoming
                          first-person shooter Valorant is also expected to have a similar esports presence, with competitive
                          tournaments eventually reaching millions of pounds in prize money. Hypixel Studios was founded in
                          2018 with support from Riot Games and other investors, and has now been officially bought by the
                          company. The studio is currently developing an upcoming block-based exploration game called Hytale
                          that combines the creative sandbox elements of global hit Minecraft with the gameplay depth of a
                          roleplaying game. Hytale has already had over 2.5 million signups for its impending beta release
                          and the trailer has been watched by millions of people around the world. As a result of the
                          acquisition, Hypixel has announced plans to create its new headquarters in Derry and has begun a
                          recruitment drive for a range of jobs.

                          Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Yahoo has hired away Tinder’s top executive to become
                          its new chief executive officer. Apollo Management Group, which recently bought the ailing search
                          engine for $5 billion, announced Friday that Jim Lanzone will be Yahoo’s new CEO as of September
                          27. He’s succeeding Guru Gowrappan, who has led Yahoo since 2018 and will now shift to a senior
                          adviser role. The move comes just four months after Verizon announced it would sell Yahoo to Apollo
                          for $5 billion. Lanzone has been the CEO of Tinder for about a year and helped revamp the popular
                          dating app during his tenure. Previously he led digital operations for CBS about about a decade and
                          has also held executive roles at IAC. “With his experience and proven management skills, we are
                          confident Jim is the right leader to steward Yahoo through a transformational new phase that can
                          leverage the best of Yahoo’s platform and performance to reach new heights,” said Yahoo Chairman
                          and Apollo Partner Reed Rayman in a press release. Yahoo added that it will “invest significantly
                          in the user experience and develop exciting new offerings that can build on its premier brands in
                          sports, finance, news, technology and more.” Verizon sale of Yahoo to Apollo is a deal that also
                          includes AOL.

                          showcase event,[25] although earlier that year, the title had accidentally been leaked.[26][27][28]

                          producer and creative director for the sequel, could not confirm if Ragnarök would also receive a
                          PC port.[29] Development of the game was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. In June 2021, head of
                          PlayStation Studios, Hermen Hulst, confirmed that the game had been delayed, partly due to the
                          pandemic,[30] as he stated that there were issues getting access to performance capture and
                          talent.[22] Santa Monica Studio issued a statement regarding the delay, which said that while they
                          were focused on delivering a top-quality game, they also wanted to maintain the safety of those
                          involved with the development.[31] The delay brought a unique issue with Atreus actor Sunny Suljic,
                          who was going through puberty during the time of production. Due to the change in his voice,
                          supervising dialogue designer Jodie Kupsco said "We had to go in and even out that performance so

  - Source              :
                          In November 2019, Prince Andrew was forced to walk away from his own royal duties after questions
                          about his ties to Jeffrey Epstein arose. It seems unlikely either scandal will be covered in depth
                          on The Crown. Harry Potter alumna Imelda Staunton will play Queen Elizabeth II. A scrapped sixth
                          season originally meant Oscar nominee Staunton would have only one installment to make an impact,
                          but now she’ll get two, as was the case with the queens before her. Rumors of Staunton’s casting
                          made waves in November 2019, shortly after the third season premiered. Deadline confirmed the news
                          in late January 2020. “I’m absolutely thrilled to confirm Imelda Staunton as Her Majesty the Queen
                          for the fifth and final season, taking The Crown into the 21st century,” creator and showrunner
                          Peter Morgan said in a statement. “Imelda is an astonishing talent and will be a fantastic
                          successor to Claire Foy and Olivia Colman.” Netflix also tweeted a statement from Staunton about
                          her casting: “I have loved watching The Crown from the very start. As an actor it was a joy to see
                          how both Claire Foy and Olivia Colman brought something special and unique to Peter Morgan’s
                          scripts. I am genuinely honored to be joining such an exceptional creative team and to be taking
                          The Crown to its conclusion.” In a recent interview on the BBC radio show Woman’s Hour, Staunton
                          spoke about the hurdles of playing Queen Elizabeth.

                          California-22 (Toss Up): Is it déjà vu for Rep. David Valadao? The California Republican was so far
                          ahead of his Democratic opponent on election night in 2018 that The AP declared him the winner —
                          only to retract the call when Valadao fell behind weeks later. This time, Valadao (who eventually
                          returned to Congress after winning in 2020) leads Democrat Rudy Salas by 5 points, but that’s
                          already down from 8 points on Tuesday night. California-41 (Lean Republican): GOP Rep. Ken Calvert
                          leads Democrat Will Rollins by about 2,100 votes in the Inland Empire, but it’s not clear how the

                          helped extend what was an extremely narrow lead on Election Day. California-49 (Toss Up):
                          Democratic Rep. Mike Levin has opened up a 5-point lead over Republican Brian Maryott in a race
                          that’s close to moving into the Democrats’ column. Colorado-03 (Likely Republican): GOP Rep. Lauren
                          Boebert is up by about 1,100 votes over Democrat Adam Frisch.

  - Source              :
                          The reveal of the 2024 companion feels like a throwback. The Doctor is traveling with only one
                          human. In Doctor Who Season 14, coming 2024, not only will the eponymous Time Lord regenerate into
                          Ncuti Gatwa but he’ll also be joined by a human named Ruby Sunday, played by Millie Gibson. With
                          this new pairing for the TARDIS, aspects of the new Doctor Who are starting to feel a bit retro for
                          longtime fans. Is Who going back to basics? Ncuti Gatwa and Millie Gibson; the new stars of Doctor
                          Who. Following the brief — and as yet, unexplained — return of David Tennant as the Doctor, Ncuti
                          Gatwa is set to become the incumbent Doctor by the end of 2023, and into the regular season,
                          starting in 2024. And, on November 18, 2022, the BBC revealed that Millie Gibson will join Gatwa as
                          the new companion. Interestingly, all the press around this news has focused on the word companion,
                          as in a singular companion, rather than a group of companions. Throughout the tenure of Jodie
                          Whittaker’s 13th Doctor, the Doctor had a TARDIS team of three companions in Seasons 11 and 12, and
                          two during the events of Flux (Season 13).

                          Now, hardcore fans will point out that throughout all those eras, there are multi-companion
                          stories, specifically the fact that Rory (Arthur Darvill) is a huge part of the Smith era after
                          Season 5, and that Matt Lucas’ Nardole is arguably just as important to Season 10 as Mackie's Bill
                          Potts. Still, broadly speaking, from 2005 onward, the format of Doctor Who generally favors just
                          one companion. And, this ratio tends to describe some of the more popular classic Doctors as well.
                          Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen) traveled alone with the 3rd( Jon Pertwee) and 4th Doctor (Tom
                          Baker), while Ace (Sophie Aldred) — who recently returned for “The Power of the Doctor” — traveled
                          alone with the 7th Doctor (Sylvester McCoy). Whovians might debate endlessly about the merits of
                          having multiple companions, but for most fans, the general vibe of Doctor Who tends toward this
                          format. “I was brought up on the Tennant and Matt Smith era,” Gibson said in a promotional
                          interview about her casting. “I always remember Amy Pond.” She’s not alone. Although the Jodie
                          Whittaker era briefly teased the notion that the 13th Doctor had several one-on-one adventures with
                          Yasmin Khan (Mandip Gill), the truth is, most of those stories occurred off-screen.

                          Nebraska. In a speech that sounded a lot like a locker room pep talk, Rhule energized the crowd

                          the state and beyond. Rhule talked a lot about family during his introductory speech and while

                          ultimately brought them here. The new coach was joined by his daughter in a short video posted to
                          the Nebraska Football Twitter account ahead of the news conference. “My family and I... We’re so
                          excited to get started. Go Big Red!” he said on the video recorded on the field with his daughter,
                          Leona. He said at the news conference that he and his wife agreed that Nebraska “is the right fit

                          Biden on Thursday is announcing the infusion of nearly $36 billion to shore up a financially
                          troubled union pension plan, preventing severe cuts to the retirement incomes of more than 350,000
                          Teamster workers and retirees across the United States. The money for the Central States Pension
                          Fund is the largest amount of federal aid provided for a pension plan, the Biden administration
                          said, and comes from the American Rescue Plan, a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package that he
                          signed into law in 2021. Many union retirement plans have been under financial pressure because of
                          underfunding and other issues. Without the federal assistance, Teamster members could have seen
                          their benefits reduced by an average of 60% starting within a couple of years.

Question 223              : Who won the Maxwell Award 2022 in college football?

                          Is the Heisman Trophy heading to Southern California? The signs seem to be pointing in that
                          direction, as USC quarterback Caleb Williams was announced as the winner of the Maxwell Award on
                          Thursday night. The Maxwell is given annually to college football's player of the year and tends to
                          foreshadow the Heisman winner as well. Seven of the last eight Maxwell winners have also won the
                          Heisman, with the lone exception in that stretch being 2018, when Oklahoma quarterback Kyler Murray
                          (Heisman) and Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa (Maxwell) split the awards. Williams won the
                          Maxwell over fellow finalists Hendon Hooker (QB, Tennessee) and C.J. Stroud (QB, Ohio State).
                          That's not the only hardware Williams took home on Thursday, as the Trojans' signal-caller was also
                          named The Associated Press college football player of the year, becoming the school’s first winner
                          of the award since 2005 with his stellar debut season for the Trojans. Williams received 32 of the
                          46 first-place votes and 117 total points from AP Top 25 poll voters to win the award presented by
                          Regions Bank. The Heisman Trophy favorite finished well ahead of TCU quarterback Max Duggan, who
                          came in second with six first-place votes and 64 points. Stroud was third, with Hooker in fourth
                          and Georgia’s Stetson Bennett fifth. Alabama linebacker Will Anderson Jr.

  - Threshold           : 0.8
  - Source              :
                          In November, Cameroon football federation president Samuel Eto'o Fils declared that he was
                          expecting Cameroon to beat Morocco in an all-African final. He was immediately ridiculed online,
                          mostly by his own compatriots, but his statement elicited a different response from me - it piqued
                          my curiosity. "What stopped an African team from winning a World Cup in years past?" I asked
                          myself. It begins with the colonisation of the continent. The unfortunate reality is that
                          throughout the seven World Cups that took place from 1930 to 1962, Egypt in 1934 was the
                          continent's sole representative. That is partly down to the brutal colonisation of the continent by
                          Western European nations, and partly down to Fifa's former bosses refusing to grant Africa an
                          automatic place at the tournament, even for countries that had gained independence. In 1966, the
                          African continent boycotted the World Cup in England to send a message to Fifa that it demanded a
                          guaranteed place at the tournament, which it then secured in 1970. Over the next three decades,
                          African teams managed brilliant upsets, including Algeria defeating West Germany, Morocco
                          dispatching Portugal, and Cameroon bludgeoning Argentina (in more ways than one). Despite this,
                          Fifa continued to drag its feet, awarding African nations only two places in 1982, three in 1994,
                          and then five in 1998.

  - Source              :
                          As a former student-athlete himself, husband to a former college gymnast, and father to two former
                          college football players, Governor Baker is deeply committed to our student-athletes and enhancing
                          their collegiate experience. These skills and perspective will be invaluable as we work with
                          policymakers to build a sustainable model for the future of college athletics.” “We know that to be
                          successful, the NCAA president needs to possess the ability to balance competing priorities,
                          inspire a shared vision, and create a broad sense of trust,” said Grant Hill, an independent member
                          of the NCAA Board of Governors and member of the presidential search committee. “As Governor of
                          Massachusetts and a successful private sector CEO, Charlie Baker has demonstrated the type of
                          results-oriented, bipartisan approach that we will need to bolster the well-being of
                          student-athletes, realize the opportunities and overcome the challenges facing the NCAA.” Governor
                          Baker arrives at the NCAA at a moment of significant transformation. Legal shifts in the
                          environment surrounding college sports have challenged the NCAA’s ability to serve as an effective
                          national regulator for college athletics, resulting in an untenable patchwork of individual state
                          laws. Partnering with federal policymakers to develop a consistent, sustainable legal framework to
                          address issues common to student-athletes and athletic departments across the country will be a top
                          and immediate priority. Throughout the search process, Governor Baker’s history of successfully
                          forging bipartisan solutions to complex problems stood out to the search committee as uniquely
                          suited to the NCAA’s present needs.

                          that suggested how to clean up the game in the wake of FBI/SDNY scandal. During her time on the

                          none. 5. Robert Gates, former U.S. Secretary of Defense and CIA director: Most recently, Gates
                          served on the NCAA Board of Governors and was the constitution committee chairman. Gates might have
                          achieved the impossible -- a rewrite of the NCAA constitution in only five months' time. In that
                          span, the constitution was shrunk from 43 to 18 pages. "It really has to do with getting the NCAA,
                          at a national level, out of the picture in a lot of cases," he said. Gates continues to get raves
                          from those who worked with him on that committee. 6. Chris Howard, executive vice president and CEO

                          he joined the CFP committee in 2017. Howard maneuvered impressively among athletic types in the

                          The space rock looks to have been captured by our planet's gravity over 60 years ago. An asteroid
                          just spotted for the first time seems to have been circling Earth for decades. Our planet has a
                          pretty permanent relationship with the moon, but occasionally Earth's gravity can also capture
                          small asteroids that then spend a period of time orbiting us as a sort of temporary satellite. This
                          has happened at least twice this century, with the "mini moons" hanging around for just a few years
                          or less, but newly discovered asteroid 2022 YG appears to have been trapped in a bizarre orbit for
                          a number of decades. The curious space rock was first observed on Dec. 15. Interestingly, one of
                          the first people to spot it was amateur astronomer Gennadiy Borisov of Crimea, who is also known
                          for discovering the first known interstellar comet, which now bares his name. Asteroid 2022 YG, as
                          it has initially been cataloged, looks to be between 52 and 98 feet (16 to 30 meters) in diameter.
                          Early computer models of its orbit show that it takes about a year to circle Earth once and that it
                          has been doing so since sometime around 1961. Run the simulation into the future, and it looks as
                          though the asteroid will continue to act as a quasi-satellite until 2181 when it may finally break
                          free from Earth's gravitational hold.

                          Elvis styled his signature haircut after the comic book character and some of his stage show
                          outfits, specifically the ones with the capes, were inspired by the hero. Elvis' collection of
                          Captain Marvel comics resides at his estate in Graceland, and the musician's fondness for the hero
                          was referenced in the 2022 film Elvis. Mary Bromfield is the oldest of Billy's foster siblings and
                          very much the most mature of the team. When audiences first meet her, she is trying to get into
                          college but also has fears of leaving and missing the newfound family she has made. In her
                          superpowered form, she wears a red suit like Billy Batson but one with a skirt. In the first
                          Shazam! the teen version of Mary is played by Grace Caroline Currey, while the adult version is
                          played by Michelle Borth. For the sequel, Grace Caroline Currey will play both versions of Mary.
                          Shazam! star Zachary Levi did confirm that Mary is the most intelligent of the team, representing
                          the wisdom of Solomon. Related: Why Shazam! is an Underrated Superhero Movie In the comics, Mary
                          was originally known as Mary Marvel and was Billy Batson long-lost twin sister. This blood
                          connection between the two was cut in the New 52 relaunch to strengthen the idea that the Shazam
                          family in both their superpowered and civilian forms is one not of blood connection but of love for
                          one another.

                          December 2022, National Day, at Lusail Stadium.[31][28] The matches for each group were allocated

                          vocational and life skills training. For the first year of the program, the 2023-24 school year,
                          the funds will be available to all incoming kindergarten students and all public school students.

                          The new Bing, which is available only to a small group of testers now and will become more widely
                          available soon, looks like a hybrid of a standard search engine and a GPT-style chatbot. Type in a
                          prompt — say, “Write me a menu for a vegetarian dinner party” — and the left side of your screen
                          fills up with the standard ads and links to recipe websites. On the right side, Bing’s A.I. engine
                          starts typing out a response in full sentences, often annotated with links to the websites it’s
                          retrieving information from. To ask a follow-up question or make a more detailed request — for
                          example, “Write a grocery list for that menu, sorted by aisle, with amounts needed to make enough
                          food for eight people” — you can open up a chat window and type it. (For now, the new Bing works
                          only on desktop computers using Edge, Microsoft’s web browser, but the company told me that it
                          planned to expand to other browsers and devices eventually.) I tested the new Bing for a few hours
                          on Tuesday afternoon, and it’s a marked improvement over Google. It’s also an improvement over
                          ChatGPT, which, despite its many capabilities, was never designed to be used as a search engine. It
                          doesn’t cite its sources, and it has trouble incorporating up-to-date information or events.

                          Maps.[74] The gadget provided shortcuts to driving directions, local search and full-screen traffic

                          were known as Live Search gadget and Live Search Maps gadget; both gadgets were removed from
                          Windows Live Gallery due to possible security concerns.[75] The Live Search Maps gadget was made
                          available for download again on January 24, 2008 with the security concern addressed.[76] However,
                          around the introduction of Bing in June 2009 both gadgets were removed again. Bing's debut featured
                          an $80 to $100 million online, TV, print, and radio advertising campaign in the US.

                          This shutout for Black performers hasn’t happened since 2020 when the South Korean film Parasite
                          won many key categories, and Cynthia Erivo was the only Black performer nominated. It’s a sad
                          reminder that the Oscars remain a space that often makes room for one non-white group among winners
                          in its top categories, often represented by one successful film. By Glen Weldon Harrison Ford
                          presented the best picture award — a canny move by the evening’s producers, who were clearly
                          betting on an Everything Everywhere All at Once win, as it would reunite Ford and Quan, who starred
                          together in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom 39 years ago. The two shared a warm embrace. The
                          fantasy film about motherhood, love, googly eyes and the multiverse took home the Academy Award for
                          best picture. The film, directed by Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert — who’d picked up Oscars for
                          original screenplay and directing earlier in the evening — was widely favored to win best picture.
                          But the evening began with All Quiet on the Western Front racking up several Oscar statuettes,
                          causing some to wonder if it might be the German war film’s night. Everything Everywhere All at
                          Once went into tonight’s ceremony with 11 nominations, of which it won seven, including best
                          picture, director (Kwan and Scheinert), lead actress (Michelle Yeoh), supporting actress (Jamie Lee
                          Curtis) supporting actor (Ke Huy Quan), original screenplay and editing.

                          defense. If we can run the ball, that to me is 100-level foundational stuff. And we’re getting
                          better there. “I think we’ve got a pretty good group up front on defense. We’ve got some old heads
                          at d-tackle that have got some weight on them, can press gaps and do things, and we were still able
                          to get some movement on them guys. So it’s a work in progress, but again, I think the O-line’s
                          improved, I think the running backs are better. I like what’s happening in that room. Still got a
                          ways to go.” Nice write up on the game and the team. Enjoyed it. thanks Mid-May should be
                          interesting to see who hits the portal. kinda smh as to why qb’s didn’t get a chance to run with
                          1’s/maroon at least for a series… kinda disservice to drones for sure Soooo….I didn’t get to watch
                          the game. Did Grant Wells really have 3 kickoffs? 😲 Those duplicate numbers mess up the stat guys

                          Rizz went viral on TikTok and Twitter shortly after its launch and now has more than 130,000 users.
                          The second Rizz app was founded by three entrepreneurs in New York City, Roman Khaves, Joshua
                          Miller, and Zack Ahmed. It launched in January and has already amassed 250,000 users. Those users
                          have generated 2.5 million openers and replies. “The demand is strong because a lot of users don’t
                          know how to open up on dating apps,” said Khaves. Zhang said that one of the biggest challenges has
                          been trying to decipher inputs from users who aren’t used to writing proper AI prompts. This is
                          perhaps why Rizz gave Lloyd such nonsensical answers. In one instance, a woman presented a humorous
                          date idea on Hinge with the phrase “Steal the Declaration of Independence.” Rizz’s AI tool
                          generated the response, “As much as I’d like to see the Declaration of Independence, I think that’s
                          a little excessive.” Another woman’s profile said she knew the best spot in town for birria tacos.
                          Rizz’s AI generated the response, “I’m glad to hear you’re enjoying the birria tacos in town! It
                          sounds like you’re really taking the time to figure out your dating goals and that’s great! I’m
                          sure you’ll find the right person for you soon!” Lloyd was confused. “The app was effectively
                          breaking up with the object of my interest before we’d even chatted,” he said.

                          his contract expires at the end of 2022. In August 2021, sources said he was expected to leave when
                          the impending departure of Tad Rivelle, CIO of fixed income, was announced. Mr. Lippman has been
                          CEO of TCW Group since 2012. A TCW Group spokesman said in an email that Ms. Koch was selected for
                          "her broad experience in domestic and international business development and strategic planning."

                          For charging, the Pixel Fold supports 21W wired speeds. However, you’ll have to purchase Google’s
                          30W power adapter ($25 at Google Store) separately. The phone also supports wireless charging at up
                          to 7.5W and will work with any Qi wireless charger. No. Furthermore, the Google Pixel does not
                          support pen/stylus input. The Pixel Fold’s inner display is protected by Ultra Thin Glass, complete
                          with a protective plastic layer applied. Gorilla Glass Victus protects the external display. Yes.
                          The Google Pixel Fold has an IPX8 certification, which means it can be submerged in up to 1.5
                          meters of freshwater for up to 30 minutes. No, Google no longer includes chargers with its
                          smartphones. You’ll have to buy a compatible charger that supports USB Power Delivery PPS. The
                          Google Pixel Fold supports dual SIMs. One is a nano-SIM slot, and the second is via eSIM. The Pixel
                          Fold was announced on May 10, 2023. General availability of the phone will commence in June 2023.
                          Folding phones are great for those who want a large-screen device but don’t want the size penalty
                          of carrying a tablet. Based on our hands-on experience, the Pixel Fold should also be a great
                          traditional handset when folded. There’s no indication that Google is working on a second, smaller
                          flip phone to partner the Pixel Fold or challenge the Galaxy Z Flip series.

                          Zoom with 5x optical zoom, Real Tone, Night Sight and Portrait photography along with pro-level
                          modes from Pixel 7 Pro, such as 10-bit HDR video. Plus, you can use Magic Eraser and Photo Unblur
                          in Google Photos to help get your pictures looking just right. With Rear Camera Selfie on Pixel
                          Fold, you can get the highest quality selfie on a Pixel ever. Use the exterior screen as your
                          viewfinder and the 48-megapixel main camera to get an amazing selfie. Ever feel left out as the
                          photographer during a group photo? Just set up Pixel Fold in tabletop mode across the room and join
                          everyone in the shot. You can even use the new palm gesture to trigger the shutter. Finally, to
                          take the stunning astrophotography shots that Pixel is known for even without a tripod handy, you
                          can use tent mode to aim the camera at the night sky and use the front display for camera controls.
                          At I/O we gave a sneak peek at an experience coming to Pixel Fold when Android 14 launches later
                          this year. Powered by Tensor G2, Dual Screen interpreter mode simultaneously uses the inner and
                          outer screens to translate live conversations. With this feature, you'll be able to have more
                          natural conversations across languages, without having to huddle around a single screen.

                          The tablet, which has rounded edges and corners, comes in three colors: porcelain, hazel and rose,

                          Pixel 7A at the show. Like Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 4, the Pixel Fold opens up like a book, allowing
                          users to take advantage of its front display, or its larger tablet-like inner screen. Google says
                          the Pixel Fold’s 5.8-inch external display should feel just like a standard smartphone screen
                          whether surfing the web or checking TikTok. That would be a sharp contrast from Samsung’s Z Fold,
                          which uses a larger, though thinner 6.2-inch outer screen that can feel cramped while doing things
                          like typing messages. Inside, the Pixel Fold gets a 7.6-inch panel that folds directly down its
                          center line. The Z Fold packs a similar internal display, though it looks as though Samsung’s
                          offering has thinner bezels around its inner screen. Google also claims that the Pixel Fold is the
                          thinnest foldable on the market whether folded or unfolded. That should come as a relief to
                          consumers who’ve balked at Samsung’s bulky Z Fold’s design.

                          up under the waterfall. Using Magic Editor, you’ll also be able to create new content to fill in
                          the gaps after repositioning your subject. Take this picture of a boy on his birthday. It’s a good
                          photo but it could be better if he was front and center. With the power of generative AI, you can
                          create more of the bench and balloons to fill in those gaps, and they’ll blend seamlessly into your
                          photo. The end result? A stunning shot that captures the feeling of his big day. We plan to give
                          select Pixel phones early access to Magic Editor later this year. While this new, experimental
                          technology will open up exciting editing possibilities, we know there might be times when the

                          over time so you can get the best edits possible. Over the past few years, AI has simplified
                          complex photo editing tasks, allowing you to easily enhance your memories and get creative with
                          your editing. And with these tools, you all collectively edit 1.7 billion photos each month — right

                          reportedly gone through several iterations as well as years of delays. It’s meant to be CEO Tim
                          Cook’s signature addition to the Apple product lineup, and it’s garnered praise from industry
                          insiders, even though it will enter a market that hasn’t taken off. Its primary competitor will
                          likely be Meta, which has enjoyed relative success with its games-focused Quest 2 headset and
                          gotten a more mixed reception to its general-purpose Quest Pro. / Sign up for Verge Deals to get

                          Subscribe for regular MacRumors news and future Apple Vision Pro info. Apple Vision Pro is Apple's
                          augmented and virtual reality headset, a device that has been in development for more than a
                          decade. Vision Pro marks the company's first entrance into a new product category since the 2015
                          Apple Watch, with the device introduced at WWDC 2023 in June. A launch is set for early 2024, which
                          means January to late April. While the Apple Vision Pro is definitely a headset, Apple does not use
                          that word when referring to it. Instead, Apple calls it a spatial computer because of its ability
                          to blend digital content with the physical world. Apple Vision Pro is a mixed reality headset that
                          displays augmented reality content overlaid on world around you, and immersive entirely virtual
                          content, but it's worth noting that the headset is not see through. Everything you see is digital.
                          For augmented reality content that does not make your surroundings disappear, Apple uses cameras
                          that map out what's in front of you, translating that into a digital image augmented by virtual
                          elements. For a virtual reality experience, Apple shuts off those cameras and can make it seem like
                          you are completely isolated from what's going on around you, allowing you to focus solely on what's
                          being displayed on the headset's screens. This shift between the "real" and the "immersive" can be
                          controlled with an on-device Digital Crown.
